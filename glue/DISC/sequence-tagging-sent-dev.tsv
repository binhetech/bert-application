"I think it is not a good idea for parents to offer their school-age children money for each high grade that they get in school."	B_T0
"First of all, although what we learn in school is of great significance, but there are many things that are as important as what we learn in school."	E_T0
"Therefore, giving children a reward indicates that only high mark is important, which will mislead their children to study only."	B_T1

"Some approve this suggestion by building more sports facilities,whiles others still think its effects on the public well-being are inconspicuous."	B_S0
"As for me,I believe that more facilities should be built along with other measures being enforced for the benefits of the individuals."	I_S0
"Some people agure that many cities around the world probably see the ineffectiveness of those public facilities."	I_S0
"More specifically,human  health would gradually deteriorate because of polluted circumstances and detrimental individual habits."	I_S0

"However,they are oversimplifying the situation."	I_S0
"As a matter of fact,the sports facilities are usually located in the commuities where green plants are covered and surrounded."	I_S0
"It is obvious to witness the positive functions of these sports facilities in terms of the health of citizens."	I_S0

"But firstly, if you have an aim to study , you needn't the work and travel to help you build another aim."	I_S0
"If you don't have a clear aim before go to work or to travel, the work have possible to be only meaningless labor and travel is only interesting entertainment."	I_S0

"Recently, many young students are leaving schools with negative thoughts on studying."	S_T0
"And I want to talk about why this thing happened and what we can do for it."	B_S0
"First of all, the reason why this thing happened may be that sudents have be given too much pressure."	I_S0
"As far as I know, some teachers always gives students plenty of homework, and this may influence the students' willingness on studying."	I_S0
"And if this thing appeared too often, it willl cost a bad outcomes on students studying."	I_S0
"And another reason may be that some students have problems with the study on some subjects."	I_S0
"I say this because I'm exactely a example of this, although my reaction is not that violent."	I_S0
"Because of the problems on one or few subjects, students may lose the confidents on studying other subject."	I_S0
"Sooner or later, it will become a negative thought."	I_S0
"So the above two reasons I gave are the mian reasons I think cause the negative thoughts of the students."	I_S0
"But how can we solve these kinds of problems, here are some thing that we can do to prevent it happen."	I_S0
"We should  give less homework to students, but less homework is not mean no homework."	I_S0
"On one hand, we should give students more extra time to do some significant things, for example, to be an volunteer of some charity activities."	I_S0
"But one the other hand, students need to do many homework for passing the exams."	I_S0
"So maybe we can cut off a few  quantity of the homework, to give some extra time for students to relax and enjoy their time."	I_S0
"So that's what I want to say, students may have some negative thoughts on studying if we do not care about what they are thinking about, we have to pay more attention on how to give them a enjoyable studying experiments."	E_S0

"And the gas which is emissed by cars will cause the air be more and more dirty."	I_S0
"Then the goverment must do some scheme such as who use the public transportantion or just walk when they go to another place will give them some prizes or glorise."	I_S0

"I think the disadvantages outweigh advantages."	S_T1
"In my opinions,if  high school or college students take one year off before they finished their school and going to university,they will forget their knowledges as a result of over relaxed."	B_S0
"For me ,the last year before going to university is the most important year."	I_S0
"Students take off one year means they needs to reread."	I_S0

"Then when she came back, we already finished our IGCSE CIE exams,we are started to prepared for A-Level lessons."	I_S0
"But she needs to have a make-up examination, then very quick, she started to found out that she cannot remember most of konwledges,and it has no time for her to prepared."	I_S0
"Then, not surprisingly,she failed."	I_S0
"She cannot go to AS like all of us."	I_S0
"At first ,she decided to reread, but she can't makes friends with her class now, which the students are already konw each-other very well."	I_S0
"She felt loney and hopeless, and just one month, she just drop-out."	I_S0
"I don't know where is she now,and how is she going."	I_S0
"Accroding to this experience, all of us should know ,take off before a really important thing, for example going to university, is not a good idea."	I_S0

"According to the chart, it is obvious that most of graduates and postgraduates chose to further study after finishing study while the figure for these two groups who started to do voluntary work consitutes for the smallest part of the total."	B_S0

"Their ad goes like some people annoucing that how safe and well water they have and a man drinking Nongfu Spring, then have a expression which looks like he is really enjoying this water, and he says 'Nongfu Spring is a little sweet'."	I_S0
"This maybe something new for people during years ago, this is because people have never seen that kind of ads before."	I_S0
"Then all the people wanted to try that water, but unfortunately, they cannot feel a little sweet at all."	I_S0
"And few years ago, there was a huge event came: the government inspect the quality of the water, it said that Nongfu Spring was not on the safe water's degree, and there were some harmful ingredients in it."	I_S0
"So this just conveys that ads could make products better than they really are, sometime can even judge bad to good."	E_S0
"Admittedly, ads could make products seems much better than the real thing, but we should know that all the people in the world have the same flavor."	B_C0

"Firstly,many people do not exercise regularly mainly because there are not enough sports facilities available for them."	I_S0
"Therefore they tend to live a sedentary lifestyle ,which is the root cause of the increasing rate of obesity,rather than to find places to do sports."	I_S0

"To cope with this a pressing issue, not only a higher tax should be implemented, but also guiding promoted by government on society to have a regular exercise is highly acceptable."	S_T1
"It cannot be denied that eating more fast food will lead to many serious sickness faced by inhabitants as this food contains more chemical ingredients which is not good for health."	S_M0
"A current study conducted by WHO showed that many citizens suffering many health problems these days are mainly caused by unhealthy food they consume in their daily lives."	B_S1
"This outcome of this study indicates that a great health problems suffered by city-settlers is highly connected with much fast food humans consume."	E_S1
"Aside from previous discussion, I am more likely to reckon that a lack of exercise held by inhabitants is another detrimental factor influencing this trend."	S_M0
"A new finding conducted by British health government informed that many British-settlers have a less time to do regular sport."	B_S0
"This phenomenon creates high obesity rate which highly results in some serious diseases."	I_S0
"It is thus lack of exercise is another factor influencing human health problem."	E_S0
"In order to tackle this problem, besides a high fast-food tax whose aim to decrease the number of people consuming unhealthy meal, a regular exercise should be promoted by government as well, so that the awareness of inhabitants to do more exercise becomes greater which finally contribute to decrease a health problem encountered by human beings."

"From this point, recycling can be extremely important in our daily life, we are always accustomed to throw the litter into the dustbin without considering recycling."	I_S0
"Even a slight change everyone makes in their life, the society will be better and better."	E_S0
"What’s more, the governments should take measures to educate the public, because as I mentioned above, not all people have the awareness of recycling, and not all people are lucky to get high level of education in their lifetime, only when they realized the importance of recycling can they begin to try to regulate their behavior."	S_M0
"In addition, the governments should put a lot of efforts to construct basic facilities related to recycling, such as more recycled dustbins, more convenient vehicles, more recycled electronic appliances and more preferential policies, etc."	B_S1
"I think the city will become better if these proposals come into practice."	E_S1
"As for individuals, especially for people with high level of education, we should carry out loads of charity projects to assist the government to educate the public, people also recycle more if condition permits."	S_M0

"For example, if these aren't laws constraining people's behaviour, wanton abuse of human beings to opem, excessive abuse resulting in drastic reduction of energy, ecological devastation, will cause many environmental problems."	I_S0
"Without the laws to supervise people, the world trends to worse."	E_S0
"What's more, people cannot rely on the laws only."	S_M0
"As we all know, these will be many loopholes with the development of the world."	B_S0
"On the one hand, the laws can not cover all aspects about recycling."	I_S0
"On the other hand, with the rise of new thing, the laws need to change to control or balance the new thing."	I_S0
"But it needs time."	I_S0

"Nowadays, it is not stranged to read a report that noboay is willing to give help to an old man who failed."	B_S0
"However,in fact, it is just because a lot of examples of helping others are not be reported."	I_S0
"The society are not so indifferent as we think, for more an more people who have high level of moral quality are entering the society and make the world to be better."	E_S0

"And some low-income families will lose opportunities to visit the museum because of the admission fees,so that they could lose the changes to learn ex-education."	I_S0

"But she play instruments very well."	I_S0

"Some people prefer to read a book or watch a movie during their break time,because they think in this way,they can learn and relax at the same time,and they don't need to be worried about "they don't make their time useful"."	S_T1
"But in my point,I don't think it's a good way to relax,and I prefer to encourage people to relax by doing physical exercise."	S_T0
"In the following essay,I will explain my supporting reason."	O
"Firstly,compared to the fact that doing exercise relax us mentally and physically, reading a book and watching a movie cannot relax us mentally."	S_M0
"It is obvious that when we are reading or watching a movie,we need to concerntrate on them."	B_S0
"There is no chance for our brain to take a break."	I_S0

"Secondly,reading and watching is not good for our eyes."	S_M0

"But I disagree this point."	B_S0
"Body is the first factor of a good future,and if we can't take care of our body,our eyes,we can't get a high achievement in our future."	I_S0

"However, there were plenty of shops and three plots of farmland in the middle of Stokeford which along the River Stoke flowed from south-west to north-east in the past of 1930, but all of them were replaced by houses and roads."	B_S1
"With the ever-increasing population in Stokeford during 80 years, the number of houses were increased dramatically which reached about four fold."	E_S1
"On the other east of Stokeford, plenty of children were studying in the primary school where it was opposite to the post office and located in the central Stokeford, in addition, the school became more modern and high-technological."	S_M1
"What made primary school colorful and beautiful was the gardens in the southern of the school, in addition, there was a large house inside of the south gargen, but it was pitty that the retirement home was built instead of gardens that cares elders to enjoy life."	B_S1

"Recently, the topic "whether the privilege should be given to the applicants coming from the rural areas while admitting into the college" has been brought  on the table, and evoked extensive discussion."	S_I0
"The advocates remind of the fact that there still exsists unbalanced regional development throughout the country."	S_M1
"While the people in the developed areas enjoying the benefits of economic growth and have vast choice of getting advanced education, such as studying aboard or accessing the university, poor people or people from rural areas find it is difficult to continue studying."	B_S0
"The obstacles mainly consists of following three aspects."	I_S0
"For the first thing, the students from rural areas are usually lack of competitiveness comparing with peers in city, because of the limitation of educational resources, teachers and equipments used in class are not as good as those in class."	I_S0
"Secondly, the family in rural areas are usually cannot be fully support to their education, ecnomically and emotionally."	I_S0
"Moreover, even students themselves donot attach enough significance on studying."	I_S0
"All those reasons account for the difficluty for poor people or people from rural areas to access the university education."	I_S0
"And in return, the rural area lacks highly educated human resources, resulting more serious unbalanced regional development, becoming a vicious circle."	E_S0
"The discommenders suggest that any kind of object privilege is a privilege, and could be unfair to another group of people in society."	S_M1
"City fellowers gain the competitiveness with their own efforts, which should not be ignored."	B_S1
"Nevertheless, admitting more rural students into college donot mean that they would back to hometown afterwards."	E_S1
"From my perspctive, we should take all factors into consideration."	B_C0
"The admission into university should under a comprehensive survey into the student regardless of his background."	I_C0
"Whereas in addition, a policy of targeted-area student could be made to guarantee there are sufficient human resources to help develop those less-develop areas."	E_C0
 
"Rcently, we have more convenience about learning a foreign language and a number of people prefer to receive  foreign language courses for travelling in another country."	S_T1
"personally, I disagree that the only reason why learn a new language is for travelling or working in foreign country."	B_S0
"Obviousl, using a foreign language fluently is necessary for some perticuler people."	I_S0
"In the first place, there are some people who just need to speak mother tongue with family and friends."	I_S0
"Therefore, it is the only aim that they would communicate with foreign partners to adopt a new tongue."	I_S0
"In the second place, if some tourist plan to travel a country which use a minority language and without a translater, it is necessary to know about the local language."	I_S0
"Then they are more likely to have a fantastic trip."	I_S0
"But after they come back, they might not use it anymore."	I_S0
"However, the functions of learnning a new language not only for work or travelling."	I_S0
"To start with, if someone plan to study a different culture, the language is the basic requirement."	I_S0
"For example, it is a better way to understand a foreign book by using the original versions."	I_S0
"As a result"	E_S0
 
"Nowadyas,students always have the negative thoughts on studying."	S_T0
"I think this is very bad."	S_T1
"So there are three reasons that i think why they do not like studying."	B_S0
"First,the enviornment of the school are becoming very bad."	I_S0
"If some students have bad habitsand these habits will also influnce other students."	I_S0
"Obviously,this is the problem about the school spirit,these bad students do something that they think they are very cool so that other students also think they are very cool,They will be to emulate them."	I_S0
"So the students thought will becoming very bad."	I_S0
"So that will cause more and more students don't want to learn."	I_S0
"Sencond,parents and teachers are irresponsible."	I_S0
"Some teachers do not tube learning of students with a negative attitude."	I_S0
"The more teachers do not want to tube,the more students do not want to learn."	I_S0
"This will also influnce the students with negative thoughts with studying."	I_S0
"Also their parents may do not have enough time to pay more attention to them,so they become very terrible."	I_S0
"BECAUSE of  their parents work too busy every day,their child always stay at home feel very lonely,no one tube,so they think they can do everyting in their homes."	I_S0
"Finally,the students have big pressure."	I_S0
"In our high schools or middle schools,teachers and parents always give their students or child highly require,if the students can not finish the homework or get high mark in the test."	I_S0
"They will disappointed with their students,some parents hit their children."	I_S0
"tEACHERS and parents unconsciously increase pressure on children,This is unfair and not good for their children."	I_S0
"In my opinion,parents and teachers shouldstrengthen the management of children,Schools should stengthen the management of school sprit,for the bad students,they should encourage of them or individual psychological guidance to them."	I_S0
"That are all my suggestions."	E_S0
 
"The discussed here is about whether we should plant genetically modified trees on a large scale."	B_I0
"In the reading passage, the author uses three reasons to support the point that we should plant more trees which have been genetically modified, while in the listening, the professor indicates that none of the arguments in the passage is convincing."	E_I0
"To begin with, the professor uses the fact that genetically modified trees are not hardier than nature trees to contradict the point in the reading that genetically modified trees are more likely to survive because they have resistance to specific infections."	S_M0
"From the speaker's perspective, the genetically modified trees are more likely to die when facing infections because they are too uniform."	B_S1
"Therefore, if they were infected by some diseases that never been considered, they are bound to all die."	E_S1
"Apart from that, the reading contends that genetically modified trees could bring enormous economic benefits to the farmers."	S_M0
"Nevertheless, in the lecture the professor casts doubt to the point by mentioning that farmers have to pay the componies everytime they plant the genetically modified trees according to the laws."	B_S1
"Thus the farmers will actually spend more money on the trees which is not economic at all."	E_S1
"Finally, the author argues that the plating of genetically modified trees could prevent overexploitation of wild trees."	S_M0
"Nevertheless, the professor refutes the assertion by using the fact that genetically modified trees actually damage the wild trees."	B_S0
"She further illustrates that by stating that genetically modified trees are more aggressive."	I_S0
"They can thus gain more resources when they live with wild trees in the same area."	I_S0
"In this way, wild trees can't flourish at all."	E_S0
 
"The education of children is always of great concern for most families all over the world."	B_I0
"Various ways of children education have occurred such as giving children limited pocket money to instruct them on money management."	I_I0
"Some people may contend that doing part-time job is not very benefitial."	E_I0
"However, from my perspective, it is of necessity to have some working experience while studying at school or university."	S_T0
"First off, a sufficient involvement of part-time job can enrich children's experience and broaden thier horizons."	S_M0
"Most of the experience that they have while working outside the school or university is the invaluable knowledge that can hardly be obtained in the ivory towers."	B_S1
"For example, if a teenager wants to be a  historian, it will be of great significance for him to work in historical museums as a commentator, as it will effectively increase his or her knowledge about some specific time of history, and thus pave the way for his future career path."	E_S1
"Participating in part-time job will also give rise to the promotion of teenage children's ability of independence."	S_M0
"Teenagers can earn their own daily bread by their own work and be gradually independent from their parents."	B_S0
"Using his or her own money, one teenager can buy whatever he or she need , such as books, stationeries and even digital equipments, instead of asking their parents for help."	I_S0
"They can even further explore the career path with the money."	E_S0
"Admittedly, taking part-time job can effect teenagers' grade in school or university because a extra work will effect their concentration on study in some measure."	S_M0
"However, the knowledge they gained and the opportunities they met when working can in a sense surpass the defects of the impact on grades."	B_S0
"It doesn't mean that grade is not essential for a student."	I_S0
"In fact, study is of great importance for teenagers but not the only matter for students."	E_S0
"In conclusion, we are supposed to lay emphasis on a proper involvement of part-time job."	B_C1

"There are two advantages."	I_I0
"As we all know, studying is a critical hard work for our students."	I_I0
"They have to get up earlier than ouhers, from morning to evening."	I_I0
"There are too many subjects for students to finish, never mind the comptition with their classmates and the stress coming from their parents and teachers."	I_I0

"Taking myself for an example."	S_T0
"I used to get some money after my final exam, not too much, I could use this money to buy some favourite books."	S_S2
"On the anther hand, I look on this kind of prize as view as form between parents and children."	S_M1

"When it comes to discuss about the reason why people participate in learning foreign language, it is sometimes claimed that people learn foreign language for traveling in the foreign country, but some of them may think they learn foreign languages for the other purpose."	S_T1
"I personally hold the perspective that people learn to speak the foreign languages for traveling ,but some other targets people learning English  for should also not be ignored."	B_S0
"To begin with, traveling to the other countries truly requires the explorer to speak the foreign languages well."	I_S0
"Learning a foreign language is the most necessary way to go to another country."	I_S0
"For instance, it is not allowed to settle in France without a fluency French speaking skill, or it is incredible to travel somewhere with the misunderstanding of foreign languages."	I_S0
"Therefore, traveling to foreign country can be the motivation of learning foreign languages."	I_S0
"In addition, the other purposes of learning foreign languages are also considerable reasons for the people who is learning to speak foreign languages."	I_S0
"Some scholars learn the foreign languages for academical studies and some art teachers& diplomatists study them for better occupations."	I_S0
"For instance, nowdays there are still a lot of people studying the Latin, even though the nation of the foreign languages dose not exist any more."	I_S0

"I definitely agree with this statement."	B_T0
"The modern life  is becoming more and more complex, so young people need to do something to adapt to the harder life."	I_T0
"There are some  reasons why I feel this way: with the abilities to plan and organize, young peopple can control their time better and do more things effectively."	E_T0
"If  young people have the capacity to make a plan, they will get a perfect time arrangement and control their time better."	S_M1

"In my opinion, laws should guide and regulate garbage collection, but the promotion of garbage collection cannot depend on the provisions of laws  ."	S_I0
"Waste recovery is divided into several stages: the classification of wastes by producers, the transportation and centralized treatment and reuse of wastes, and the supervision and policy support from the government."	S_M0
"Every link needs the provisions of the law and the supervision of the judicial department."	S_S2
"However, the law can only play a guiding role."	S_M0
"The main body of waste reuse is the garbage producer, enterprise and government, in other words, people."	B_S0
"Laws and propaganda alone cannot be relied on to compel people to insist on a time-consuming and unproductive activity."	I_S0
"Therefore, to fully implement the reuse of waste needs policy support - so that the main body of the waste recycling actually benefit from the policy."	I_S0
"For example, there are financial subsidies for waste disposal enterprises and tax breaks for products produced from recycling waste."	I_S0
"At the same time, appropriate penalties should be imposed on groups that are contrary to the reuse of wastes, such as those who do not classify wastes."	E_S0
"At present, due to the limitations of science and technology, the cost of recycling is still higher than the production of new products, and the benefits of recycling are long-term, in other words, invisible."	S_M0
"It is unrealistic to simply use the law to force society as a whole to use waste."	B_S0
"The real solution is for society as a whole to feel the benefits of recycling."	I_S0
"That is what lawmakers should be thinking."	E_S0
 
"Reading and listening materials debate the discovery of a Tyrannosaurus Rex fossil 70 million years ago."	B_I0
"The author argues that T-Rex fossils may still contain the remains of the animal's actual tissues, which is refuted by the following speakers."	E_I0
"First, the authors point out that the soft organic matter in the branching channels indicates the actual vascular remains of Tyrannosaurus Rex."	S_M0
"However, the spokesman objected to the statement, saying that the soft material inside is the vestige of bacteria lagging behind soft and moist."	B_S1
"This is because when an organism dies, bacteria sometimes leave holes in the bone, leaving traces of organic matter."	E_S1
"Secondly, the author thinks that the sphere with iron and red center may be the remnant of red blood cells, while the speaker looks at the problem from the opposite perspective."	S_M0
"According to her introduction, this reddish sphere was found in the fossils of other animals, which had no red blood cells."	B_S0
"Since the sphere exists in organisms without red blood cells, it cannot be a remnant of red blood cells."	I_S0
"Instead, they may be reddish minerals."	E_S0
"Third, the authors say scientists have discovered collagen, which is believed to be related to bone tissue."	S_M0
"Similarly, the speaker holds the opposite view."	B_S0

"There are many parents decide to have early education before the child was born."	I_S0
"But the influence of society is far less than that of the family."	E_S0
"The reason why family has a great influence on chilren is that chilren are accompanied by their parents from birth and they can only get in touch with few social things unless they work when they grow up."	S_M1
"Family affects the children's physical and psychological aspects."	B_S0
"From the physical aspect, the family provides the material basis for their life, affect their growth and development, establish their habits and so on."	I_S0

"Familiy has preconception, direct initiative and un shakable authority on children's growth."	E_S0
"Therefore, I think family has a geater influence on children's development."	B_C1

"It is because people can choose the best one form so many choices that people like more choices."	I_S0
"So some people prefer having more TV channels."	I_S0
"However,there are also many people who do not think having more TV channels  is good."	I_S0
"As most of us know,Jingdong mail has less goods than Taobao."	I_S0
"Although Jingdong mail does not have as many goods as Taobao has,a large quantities of people perfer the former."	I_S0
"Why?"	I_S0
"The quality of goods in Jingdong mail are better than it in Taobao."	I_S0

"In my opinion, leadship means people can organize other people."	B_S0
"Maybe some people said they do not how to do that or no one teaches them how to do that."	I_S0
"But I think that is because they  never observe how other people do that."	I_S0
"For example, when I was in middle school, I was minitor of my class."	I_S0
"At the began, no one followed my instructions."	I_S0

"Nowadays, there is much discussion these day about the price of gas should be increase because of this is a method to solve traffic and other environment pollution."	S_T1
"I do not think that increasing this price is only thing."	B_S0
"In the essay ,I will outline my reasons for holding this point of view."	I_S0
"First of all, Raising gasoline prices in the first method is only a short term solution to growing transportation rather than a long time."	I_S0
"The most immediate factor is that people can pass the limit way to solve the daily traffic."	I_S0
"Secondly, the high price of petrol makes some people with average income to avoid driving their car, they have to taking crowded public transport."	I_S0
"Such as public bus, public subway to go where they want to go."	I_S0
"In addition, this method should be brings about the number of private cars on road is reduced owing to higher petrol cost."	I_S0
"However, some measures should be take to solve this problems."	I_S0
"Firstly, For the government, there should be provided some strategies for this  kinds of problems."	I_S0
"For instance, speeding up the construction of some new roads to avoid  traffic problems."	I_S0
"For society, some manufactures can make new energy cars that use solar energy to charge its batteries and protect the environment better."	I_S0
"For individual, Everyone should have a sense of protecting the environment."	I_S0
"This means that people try to take public transport if they are not going very far."	I_S0
"In the end, I do not think increasing gasoline prices is the only way to solve these problems."	I_S0
"Everyone has the responsibility to do that."	E_S0
 
"In my point of view, the disadvantages outweight the advantage of this development."	S_T1
"The disadvantage of going to remote natural environment is obvious and of a large number."	B_S0
"One of the most see disadvantage is the pollution, as both tourists and scientist may bring pollution to remote natural areas."	I_S0
"Even if they really cared a lot, they may still cause contamination without being on porpose."	I_S0
"For example, some insects which do not belong to that environment might come with them and become a threat to other local animals, and somtimes, destroy the whole eco-system."	I_S0
"There are also other disadvantages like, putting tourists themselves in danger and, overexploiting caused by the tourists' visiting."	I_S0
"No need to say, places like the Poles and some other remote natural places will put one into danger in he/she is not well prepared."	I_S0
"Any mistakes in the wild will be life-risking."	I_S0
"And if one unexploited place is becoming popular with more and more tourists, those capitalists might come to make money from tourists, while ruining the envionment."	I_S0
"This is not to say that there is no advantage of going to such places."	I_S0
"For scientist, there are more unknows to be find and mysteries to be solve in these remote natural areas."	I_S0
"Thats why there are so many scientists living in the labs built in South poles, regardless of the bitter coldness."	I_S0
"For tourist, remote natural places are always far more attracting than other places."	I_S0
"Theres is no other places like pole areas where you can enjoy the gorgeous aurora borealis."	I_S0
"But campared to the advantages, the disadvantage is obviously outweighting, as nothing can be more serious than the pollution, explotation, and even ruin to those remote natural environment."	E_S0
 
"Nowadays, people have higher life quality than in the past, some people consider we have too many choices."	S_T1
"In my view, i disagree with this opinion."	B_S0
"Admittedly, our economic conditions have become better, we do not should give our dreams in order to affordable fundamental charge in daily life ."	I_S0
"For example, when  students gradated , they can choose look for work, and they can choose further study."	I_S0
"however, it is not respective people have too many choice."	I_S0
"For the one reason that , people's choices can be interfered with by others ."	I_S0
"especially young people."	I_S0
"their 's choice are more easier effect by their's parents."	I_S0
"For example, China is a system of human kindness,  people always put feelings first."	I_S0
"when some young people are unwilling to get married, the pressure of parents will prevent them from sticking to their choice."	I_S0
"so they do not really have a choice."	I_S0
"for the second reason that ,people's choice are influenced by society."	I_S0
"because we are get used this social system."	I_S0
"for example, in China, people are more pay attention feeling ."	I_S0
"many people give up to fight in other places in order to support their parents."	I_S0
"so people;s choices are limited by social rules."	I_S0
"In conclusion, people have more option than in the past, people do not have to choose to survive."	I_S0
"But nowadays people do not have much choice, which are still limited by society and family."	E_S0
 
"there is common phenomenon which many young students are leaving schools with negative thoughts on studying."	S_T0
"i rekon the causes of the phenomenon have many factors,so i will institute my opinion about the question."	B_S0
"as for a student which are leaving school,being negative with studying can be regard as losing interst in studying."	I_S0
"in my opinion,it can be divided intio two aspects."	I_S0
"on the one hand ,what students do not want to study in school can attribute to mental factor."	I_S0
"students lost their interst in studying and often failed at the exam,these can lead to people feel depressed in studying,such as  when i was in pirmary school and will go to intermediate school, i failed at the finnal exam, i feel very sad and do not want to study,eventually the mind which i want to leave school flashed."	I_S0
"on the other hand ,i rekon the phenomenon can be caused by the nature of people which want to relax ourselves."	I_S0
"when i was a child who are leaving school ,i also want to go out with my friends to do other things,such as go shopping with my friends or go swimming with my friends."	I_S0
"in a word ,i do not want to go to school ."	I_S0
"as you can find the question is a common phenomenon in our daily life,we should try our best to change the question and improve the situation."	I_S0
"in my mind,we should change it from the sourse."	I_S0
"we should improe the quailty of study and make people feel interst in study."	I_S0
"from what i have said,i rekon we should try our best to improe the stituation and make people feel interst in study."	E_S0
 
"The chart below demostrates the average monthly temperatures in London,New York and Sydney,after which there is a table covering the average number of  hours of sunshine per year in those three cities."	S_I0
"As we can see,in spring and winter,London is way hotter than New York and Sydney with temperature surpassing by 20 and 15 degrees each."	S_M1
"However,the temperature of London in summer is rock bottom of both year-round temperature in London and summer temperature in the other two cities with only 15 degrees."	B_S1
"This disparity may mainly result from the least annual hours of sunshine for london of three cities."	E_S1
"Unlike London,New York and Sydney hit the peak temperature in summer by 30 and 23 degrees respectively during the whole year."	S_M1
"Furthermore,New York is the city which is the hottest in summer and the coolest in winter,possibly because the hours of sunshine,which is the top of the list,may be concerntrated in summer then leaving less hours in winter."	B_S2
"To sum up,it is quite clear that London holds a different climate pattern with that in New York and Sydney,which is much cooler in summer and the least hours of sunhine."	E_S2

"As far as I'm aware,I think it's a good idea that school-age children should be offered money for their high grade getting in school."	S_T0
"Firstly,money can servre as a catalyst for those who don't have much interset or confidence in study."	B_S0
"To illustrate,when I was in primary school,there was a time when I have some trouble in math and I was nearly cast out."	I_S0
"Noticing my disappointment,my mother made a deal with me that I could be taken to the amusement pa for fun if I stuck on learning and got a good result."	I_S0
"This point worked and my grade began to improve."	I_S0
"Most of kids' needs are connected with money and once they are promised with money they will try their best to attain them,hence their grades improved."	E_S0
"What's more,children may get a significant topic from this idea  that persistence and intelligence is what it takes to fulfill their goals."	S_M2
"Every time they are provided with money in the exchange for their marks,they will be joyful and start fighting for a larger progress without a hesitation."	S_S2

"What causes this circumstances,I will express my opion in another paragrah."	I_S0
"In my view,for part of students,study is really hard for them,some teenagers their interest is not on langurage or math and so on."	I_S0
"In China a lot of student like music and drawing,but in China school,this lessons are taking by math or Chinese and English,can you belive there are only 3 kinds of leasson ,week by week."	I_S0
"Children feel tireble and boring."	I_S0
"And the model of teaching in China is one reason to make this situation,too."	I_S0
"Normally There are more than 60 person in one class room."	I_S0
"Teachers can't make sure every student could focus on him."	I_S0
"As a result there are a number of students feel disappointed on their study, they think teachers are ignore them,and blame this on teachers."	I_S0
"I think we can't change the schools but we can change ourselves,our student should become more postive,if you don't understand what are teachers talking,you can ask him before the class."	I_S0
"And if you like music ,you could learn this in your sparetime,than will make you daily life more colorful."	I_S0
"In a word,the education of China should make some different, making a interest enviorment of school,let more students want to stay at school."	E_S0

"Rencently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate: whether young people today are more likely to invest their time and efforts in improving the world than young people in the past."	B_I0
"Opinion varies from person to another."	E_I0
"Some claim that young people are not willing to put more time and efforts in improving the world that young people in the past."	B_T0
"However,  contrary to their view comes my perspective that the young people distribute more time and efforts in changing the world than before."	E_T0
"My points are elaborated as follow."	S_T1
"Firstly, with the development of society, the young people could obtain more feedback if they choose to improve the world."	S_M1
"Today, the company and government are willing to provide more position to the young people and increase the sallery rapidly than before, which encourage the passion of young people to work harder in different areas, such as inventing efficient electronic equipment, building beautiful bridge, improving the method of teaching, so that the world is improved quickly."	B_S0
"By contrast, in the past, the sallery is relatively low, leading to the difficulty of meeting basic needs, so it is impossible for the young people to invest their time and efforts to improve the world."	I_S0
"Imaging the situation, if a man could gain a well-paid job as a engineer, which could guarantee him a high quailty of daily life, besides the earning money for making a living, he could distribute much time to improve the appreance of bridge."	E_S0
"In addition, the developed education arouses the awareness of making the contribution to the society."	S_M1
"Becasue the students obtain much more knowledge, so that it is likely for them to realize that they take a lot of benefits from the society, such as the chance of studying in the senior high school for free."	B_S0
"so they should take the responsibility of improving the world."	I_S0
"By contrast, in the past, without these knowledge, they would pay more attention to themselves and don't understand the importance to make contribution to the society, so they would not invest their time and efforts to improving the society."	I_S0
"For example, a fifteen years old people who has no chance to study in the senior high school work with his workmates."	I_S0
"Under this situation, the every day conversation is about the sallery, the price of the meat or the beautiful car and clothes."	I_S0
"So he could not realize the importance of the contribution to the society, and he also can't eveluate the import of society on him, and he is not willing to make feedback t

"	E_S0
"In conclusion, it is necessary to repeat my view that the young people is likely to invest their time and efforts to the society than before, because the society could give more feedback, and the contain the awareness of making the contribution to the society."	S_C2

"To begin with, students can separate the assignment into small parts and allocate each if them to every group member, a case in which students can figure out the projects more easily."	S_T1
"Arecent experiment conducted by Harvard University has revealed an astonishing fact that given the same research projects, designing a computer program students who worked with team did a better job and spent at least two times less than ones who were alone."	S_S2
"Accordingly, it is obvios that students can accomplish the school tasks more efficiently."	S_T1
"In addition, working with others makes it possible for students to learn from others, thereby correcting their bad habits and also cultivating their team spirit which is beneficial to their future development."	S_M2

"I did try a lot improve my biology score by myself, nevertheless all my efforts are in vain."	I_S0
"Until our biology teacher implements a new study method, study group."	I_S0
"fortunately I realized my own wrong study pattern and got an ideal result at last."	E_S0
"To sum up, studing ingroup is really a great way for stuents to improve their grades and hence their effectivencess."	S_S2
 
"Nowadays, parents are looking forward to seeing their children's perfect acdemic performance by rewarding them in different method, one of which is money."	S_I0
"I do not think it is an appropriate way to induce student to make progress in their study life."	S_T0
"Initially, using money to illure students to study the class that they are not interested with only lead to the misleading that parent thinks the young boy or girl really like the major, and thinks that they should stick with the project through their study life."	S_M0
"As a result, the student who is captured by the money lose the oppotunity to find the subject  they really favor of."	B_S1
"What a pity it is to lose the interst in the subject you are work on, and the tragedy derives from the rewarding system making by the parents who reward their children's high mark with money."	E_S1
"What's more, the abnormal rewarding system can lead to students' desperate pursuit for marks instead of attatching importance on practice."	S_M0
"What practice is to theority, what water is to fish."	B_S0
"It can be harmful if student put too focus on mark rather than appliance."	I_S0
"For example, there was a time when my mom use the money to reward my high point test result."	I_S0
"I was hooked by the great mount of money, sinking all myself in studing the theory not going into the labouratory."	I_S0
"High point as I obtained, I find I did not learn anything useful."	E_S0
"Lastly, the money is not a suitble substance for rewarding children."	S_M0
"When the children develope the desire for the money too early in the life."	B_S0
"They will lose their innocent before other same-age friends."	I_S0
"Subsequently, it will let them feel a feeling of out of the peers."	I_S0
"Take my brother Tom as an example."	I_S0
"Tom has an very strong love for money since a very early age."	I_S0
"Though he is not much older than me, he represents an abnormal social trait."	I_S0

"All the kids do not make friends with him."	E_S0
"Money rewarding system applying to the academic performance of a kid is definately an wrong choice."	B_C0

"In the society,there are still a lot of people do not obey the law,then there will be more and more illegal behaviors in the society will be in chaos."	I_T1
"When setting up a law to make people have a fixed  rubbish,recycled,people will obey the law."	I_T1
"Because comply with the law and take the  initiative to pay a certain amount of
garbage,this not only beautify the environment,also can let have certain rubbish recycled waste recycling companies,so that"	E_T1

"When speaking of the sence of satisfaction during working, some people believe that doning different types of tasks can make wrkers be more satisfied, while others support that do similar task all day long can make works happy."	S_T1
"In my view, woekers will be more satisfied when they have different types of job to do during workdays."	S_T0
"Firstly, having many different types of tasks can help workers to drive away the boredness of similar tasks."	S_M1
"If one does similar actions all day long, he will get exhausted and tired."	B_S0
"Take my fiend as an example, when he got his intern job in a big company, his supervisor gave him just one task to do."	I_S0
"That is to type meeting documents into the computer."	I_S0
"During his three month internship, just sat infront of the computer screen, typing all the work hours, and felt like a robot."	I_S0
"In this way, he was not happy at that time and even did not want to  go to work every day."	I_S0
"After that, believe people can not do just one task during work time."	I_S0
"By contrasty doing various work can help to make work time more interesting and less boring."	I_S0
"That is why I think workers will be more satisfied when they have different types of job to do during workdays."	E_S0
"Secondly, doing diversity kinds of work can help workers to handle things more easily."	S_M1
"That is to say, by coping with varying tasks, workers will be more capable at work."	B_S0
"In this way, they will be stronger than they used to be and be more satisfied with what they are."	I_S0
"I remember my sister who is a manager now in  a big company."	I_S0
"Even though she is busy with lots of different types of works, such as joining a meeting about the recent fashion trendm giving a motive lecture to her company members, visiting the factory of her company, she tells me that she likes her job and enjoys it very much."	I_S0
"For one reason, she is thankful that her different tasks make her better understand her career calue and give her chances to umprove her ability to deal difficulties."	I_S0
"I will not forget how confident my sister is agter she gets promoted as the manager of her department ."	I_S0
"Thus I think works will be more satisfied when they have different types of job to do during work days."	I_S0
"Even though doing similar tasks can make people be the expert in the working field, working on different types of tasks can offer oppportunities to explore more widely in the specific working area."	I_S0
"In this way ,there will be more chance for prople to feel satisfied."	E_S0
"To sum up, workers are more satisfied when they have many different ttpes of task during the workdays cause they can feel less boring and gain practical."	S_C2
 
"There is no doubt that all manner of opportunities in modern life, the internet development rapidly making information bombing which even cause people breathless."	S_I0
"Hence some people say that we have too many choices."	S_T1
"However, I disagree with that and keep a positive attitude toward it."	S_T0
"These choices broaden our horizons, offering more change to realize one's own value."	S_M1
"In the past, at least, we cannot easily obtain such amount of information , which is a limitation to self-development."	B_S0
"Talents bless by God may be hidden because of the narrow vision."	I_S0
"However, these choice we have seen make us exert our own talents, just like art, science and whatever, which means you can easily approach any field you would like and get professional guideline easier that before."	E_S0
"Furthermore, from a special prospective, you may attain a place that you never thought to do before but it may catch your eyes today."	S_M1
"The world itself is full of mysterious things that attract us to searching for."	B_S0
"How precious for you to get the change to explore unknown!"	I_S0
"For instance, my grandfather is a person of great intelligence in painting , but hardly can he in that generation can have the choice to learning art systematic, also unpractical for him to interact with the masters or even no possible to appreciate a masterpiece, which definitely a tragedy but can barely happen nowadays."	I_S0
"There is another case in point is experience of myself, a girl who keen on classical literature and was thought without talent in science."	I_S0
"Thereby I got the choice to IT and become enthusiastic to it ,helping me improve myself all-side and exposure to an amazing world of science."	E_S0
"Overall, I don' t agree with that."	B_C1
"Without those choice,  we do a lot less worry, but at the same time we lost the right to discover the world and the it reduce the probability for us to what we truly passive to ,what we truly desired."	E_C1
 
"The author of the reading material believes that dogs domesticated by humans are descended from wolves."	S_I0
"However, the professor's lecture is against the reading passage and holds the opinion that wolves may unrelated with dogs."	O
"The reading passage mentioning that some wolves may raise as pups or be fed by humans, they may visit campfires of human to eat meet, so they trust human more and help human hunting, protect human, and they became more like modern dogs by selective breeding."	S_M1
"Scientists think the process began about 14,000 years ago."	B_S0
"In some ancient tombs, dogs were found buried alongside their owners."	I_S0
"And later in the emergence of some ancient civilizations, dogs were considered pets."	E_S0
"However, the professor points that people don't know when people domesticated dogs, why they do and how they do that."	S_M1
"Wolves are more aggressive and bigger than dogs, and now most attempts to domesticate wolves have failed."	B_S0
"If you domesticate a wild dog, it will soon get close to you."	I_S0
"Ancient humans domesticate dogs by sharing foods and not scare dogs, so dogs will bring other foods back to human and became friendly."	I_S0
"The tombs that have dogs buried with their master may be the lifestyle of that time, but is still unclear exactly when the humans began to domesticate dogs."	E_S0
 
"The writing asserts that the young animals play for three main reasons."	S_I0
"However, the professor suspects the three reasons by emulating three opposite examples."	S_T1
"First, the writing proposes that young animals paly for spending their extra energy in a relatively safe way."	S_M1
"However, the professor takes an example which disproves this."	B_S0
"Whales are observed play hungurily without their mother near protecting them, who are away hunting."	I_S0
"So, playing may be the playful nature of animals."	E_S0
"Second, the writing indicates that  playing prepares young for their adulthood."	S_M1
"But the professor uses an experiment to disjustify it."	B_S0
"In the experiment, cubs are divided into two groups."	I_S0
"And in one group, cubs can play freely, while in another, cubs cannot play."	I_S0
"Consequently, when the grow up, their predating skills don't have distinguished difference."	E_S0

"The pie charts shows on the ages of the populations of Yemen and Italy in 2000 and forecasts for 2050."	S_T1
"In Ymen,old people always accounts for the minor proportion."	B_S0
"By contrast,almost half of the population(50.1%) was in the youngest age group in 2000,followed by people aging 15 to 59,making up 46.3%."	I_S0
"However,it is projected that these people will comprise the major prportion in 2050,while young children and teenagers will only account for 37% in that year."	I_S0
"In Italy,by contrast,aged people rather than the young ranks second, with people in their middle age dominating the population."	I_S0
"Specifically,the people aging from 15 to 59 comprised 61.6% in 2000 when only 24.1% of the people were in the oldest age group,which was twice of the percentage of young children and teenagers."	I_S0
"People aging from 15 to 59 is projected toaccount for 46.2% in 2050 when 42.3% of the people will be aged over 60."	I_S0
"Overall,both countries are predicted to be predominated by people aging from 15 to 59 in the future."	E_S0
 
"Nowadays, many parents use money as a reward to their children who get high grades in school."	S_T1
"This essay is written to argue against that opinion and provide a better way to achieve the same goal."	O
"It is reasonable for anyone who does well in their jobs to get rewards, for our adults, working better means higher salaries."	S_M0
"However, for students, it is not appropriate."	B_S0
"First, for students, studying for a good grade is not necessarily a job for students, because they study for themselves not for others, in this aspect, they do not deserve financial reward from others, in othr words, their reward is knowledge, which can be more beneficial than money."	I_S0
"It does not quite resemble the traditional definition of job where people work for their boss and their boss, to praise their outstanding contribution to the company, give them money as reward."	I_S0
"Therefore, students should not get money."	E_S0

"Going to museums seems a great recreational activity to many people."	B_I0
"However, there exist huge differences between museums, with some of them charging fee for admission and others not."	I_I0
"From my point of view, I support the opinion that charging fees for admission outweigh the disadvantages."	I_I0
"The reasons are listed as follows."	I_I0
"To begin with, it is necessary for the operational department of museums to take charges for the daily maintenance of objects, considering the usually small budget coming from financial subsidies."	I_I0
"In addition, setting a charging standard may contribute to controlling the people who squeeze in museums on holidays."	I_I0
"It is common sense that free museums are always the most crowded ones."	E_I0
"And a small number of visitors is beneficial to the protection of show pieces in the museums."	S_T0

"The passage discussed the topic that the pterosaurs did not have the capability of powered flight by stating three reasons."	S_I0
"However, the professor contradicts this opinion by three aspects."	S_T0
"To begin with, the passage pointed out that such huge creature hardly can produce enough energy to meet the requirements of powered flight, for they were probably cold-blooded like modern reptiles."	S_M0
"But the professor argues that recent archaeological evidence demonstrate they may have hair or fur covering onto their skin, which are typical features of warm-blooded animals."	B_S1
"This indicates that the pterosaurs very likely to be warm-blooded so that they have energy to support flight."	E_S1
"Secondly, the passage hold another view that pterosaurs cannot fly since they are extremely heavy."	S_M0
"According to professor's lecture, that is not convincing either."	B_S0
"Many research shows the pterosaurs had much light weight, comparing with their size, because of their hollow bones."	I_S0
"That proves they can fly although they are huge and seems heavy."	E_S0
"Lastly, the passage narrated the pterosaurs do not have strong leg muscles to launch themselves into the air like birds today."	S_M0
"Contrary to the  passage, the professor mentions the pterosaurs' fly style may more like the bats rather than birds, which means the use four limbs to support whole body."	B_S1

"They tend to publish the new policy and stratages which are about the details of environment methods."	I_S0
"It dose make a difference about environment,but individuals also play a majror part in improvment  of environment."	I_S0
"Protecting environment should do from some basic events such as colse the run water when you leave,clean the area where you stay and speak a little down when you are in the public."	I_S0
"Additionally,we should pay more attention to the news about environment."	I_S0
"If everyone is able to do it from a little thing,we  are likely change our environment."	I_S0
"The goverment and companies only carry out the policy,but public are the major core of the power who can actually conduct it."	I_S0

"First of the all, it can motivate chidren to study to get higher grade."	S_M0
"High grade is useful to get more advanced education, which is good for the future of children."	S_S2
"Secondly,it can improve the ability of managing money matters."	S_M0
"But we shoud not give money to children with no requirements, or they wil not cherish the money."	B_S0
"But if we  ask them to do some housework for money, we will be worried aboutt whether their time for study is enough."	I_S0
"And offering money for each high grade will make them pay more attention on their study."	E_S0
"The last but not the least, it can promote family harmony."	S_M0
"Let children understand the fact that earning money needs to make efforts, they will not be unreasonable."	B_S1

"The bar chats respectively illustrate the four types of situations that graduate and postgraduate students will be when they finish their study in units of numbers."	S_I0
"For graduates, the number of students do not separate evenly."	S_M1
"The choice of further study is in a dominant opposition, taking up 29,665 students."	B_S0
"The rest consists of the part-time work, the voluntary work and unemployment."	I_S0
"The number of part-time work is approximately similar to the number of unemployment."	I_S0
"with the former one making up 17,735 and the latter one 16,235."	I_S0
"And the voluntary work has the least students, taking up 3,500."	E_S0
"As for post graduates, they have similar tendency as graduates."	S_M1
"The further study is still the first choice they will make, having 2,725 students."	B_S0
"But the number of the part-time work is more than graduates, taking up 2,535, being close to the further study."	I_S0
"And the remaining comprises of the voluntary work and unemployment, with the former occupying 345 and the latter making up 1,625 respectively."	E_S0
"In conclusion, graduates and postgraduates have similar tend to chose what they want to do after they graduate, but there are some slight differences between them."	S_C2
 
"Should parents offer their children in school money for each high grade they get?"	S_I0
"I'll say yes and no, it really depends, and here's why."	B_T1
"Yes it could be a really good reward for children getting good grades."	E_T1
"It could be a really encouraging thing for children to work even harder."	B_S0
"Another huge benefit in ty opinion, is that this might help building up a sense of doing a real job for the children - you work harder, you get paid more."	I_S0
"I can still remember how hard I was studying before the tests every time since my mom would usually promise me to offer some money if I get a considerably good grades in unit tests back in my middle school days."	E_S0
"However, there are some potential disadvantages of paying money for good grades."	S_M2
"This might make kids studying just for the sake of money, instead of studying actually for getting more knowledge and preparing for their future - to put it simple, this may create a wrong value of study for them, especially when parents give their kids too much money."	B_S0
"In this case, kids might find a way to get around with it - they might do cheating around during the tests, copying others work just for getting good grades instead of actually study harder."	I_S0
"I saw quite a few classmate doing that at school before, and this is absolutely wrong, they're not only fooling their parents but also fooling themselves."	E_S0
"Which lead to the conclusion, rewarding for high grades could be good or bad, it really depends."	B_C1
"But in my opinion it's a good way to push children to study harder, but, again, it really needs further guidance from parents side."	E_C1
"Children really shouldn't study just for the sake of physical rewards, parents should guide them to see the real spritual joy and meaning to their future of academic studies, offering money for good grades is just a little "side boost"."	S_S2
 
"In nowadays world, high-tects are becoming more and more universal in people's daily life."	B_T1
"in my opinion, having more TV channels is definily better than only a few TV channels."	E_T1
"Firstly, having more TV channels is more suitable for the development trend of today's society because the world is getting closer, the trade between different countries builds a bridge for people in different area, so people need to have a understanding about other cultures or environment and watching TV progrems is an important way  to spread world information."	B_S0
"Secondly, people don't have any propuse when they have a thought of watching TV, so if there are only a few TV progrems, they will get board after a moment."	I_S0
"In that way, television will lose the value and function to people expectally the young."	I_S0
"Thirdly, the competion between different TV stations is also good for the quaily of TV progrems and having more TV channels is one way to produce programs."	I_S0
"People's view lead to the stress of progrem makers, and this also gives them power to make something new and fun, a famous example in China is a TV show called'Running Man' this shows have 7 seasons and every single season attacts a lot of audiences in China."	I_S0
"The main reasons it can contiune showing is that there are more and more TV shows are copying its game patten, this gives directers stress, and they accepted the advice from audience and made new patten base one these advice."	I_S0
"In conclusion, having more TV channels is much better than having a few TV progrems."	I_S0

"In my opinion, leadership can definitely be cultived by certain ways and in particular circumstances."	E_T0
"First and foremost, thre are quite a few researches, which have investigated numerous leaders of different companies, that figure out some distinguished traits do exist in personalities of those people."	S_M1
"Such as tenacity, persistence, smartness and diligence."	B_S0
"However, although it is admitted that the leaders do have some gifted attributes which would be helpful in there way to success, these borned features could only explain their achievement partly."	I_S0
"For instanve, Mayun, who is the leader of Alli, was a English teacher in countryside when he was young, he seems not the "chose" person who is bound to succeed and create the famous company."	I_S0
"On the contrary, he worked hard and learned a lot during the process of starting his own business."	I_S0
"Finally, he make it as well."	E_S0
"Moreover, nowadays there are enormous approaches to get formal education if people want."	S_M1

"Some argues that teachers should focus on academic education and not make their views about society known to the students in class."	E_I0

"If they can share them in a clear and simple way, many students will be attracted and learn more information on their own later."	E_S0
"But teachers must bear it in mind that this kind of information-sharing must be handled in a proper way."	S_M0

"While the development of art requires so much fund that some critics argue that it is a total waste."	B_S0

"What makes it worse is that they are lack of other skills to make a living."	I_S0
"In order to get rid of some tragedies which can lead to the loss of outstanding artists, the government should pay more heed to them and provide financial aid in time."	I_S0
"Another justification for offering fund for artists is that it is capable to raise public attention to awesome works of art and enhance the aesthetic judgements and taste."	I_S0
"As the result of the lack of relative study, the majority of public does not have abilities of art appreciation."	I_S0

"in recent,an increasing number of scientists and tourists can visit remote places that could not be reached before."	S_T1
"there is a popular debate between the advantages and disadvantages of this phenomenon."	B_S0
"although this trend might bring pollution,i insist that this development is beneficial to both scientis and tourists."	I_S0
"at first,a greater number of people can travel to remote natural environments such as the south pole and iceland to enjoy the fantastic views,which helps to broad the horizon of them and form an entire knowledge of the earth."	I_S0
"more people are likely to develop interest toward nature and become scientists to devote themselves to the science."	I_S0
"and the remote natural environments provide scientists with more opportunities to explore nature and make experiments,which is helpful to make new discoveries."	I_S0
"however,there is also the negative side of this trend."	I_S0
"for example,with the large number of people visiting remote natural environment,it becomes harder to prevent the increasing tonnes of trashes ."	I_S0
"The transportations that bring them to the remote places such as airplane,train,boat and car can produce a large number of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide that can lead to air pollution, water pollution and even global warming ,leaving ice to melt and some endanger species to disappear."	I_S0

"At the same time, even these wealthier countries have social problems such as poverty and crime."	I_S0
"Many communities, again even in the wealthiest countries, suffer from a lack of investment in education and health care."	I_S0
"It seems that people have somehow been persuaded to purchase a wide variety of consumer goods whilst neglecting to spend their money on areas where it could make a substantial qualitative difference to people’s lives."	E_S0
"Advertising tends to tell people that they need a certain product because of benefits such as making the purchaser look fashionable, apparently performing a task slightly faster or better, or even simply because it is good to have the things that everyone else has."	S_M1
"These reasons might have limited benefits for the individual, such as enhanced status, but rarely, if ever, benefit society as a whole."	B_S1
"This is obviously because the aim of most producers is to make ever greater sales, not to function as an organisation working for the public well-being."	E_S1
"To conclude, advertising generally aims to encourage the purchase of goods regardless of their value to societies in general."	S_C2

"Overall, it is clear that both talent and experience in the life are important for a people’s development."	S_C2

"That is to say, if a child grows up in a good family environment, they will have a better personal character."	E_S0
"The another reason is that, family education is the core of education."	S_M0

"The short-faced bear, which was the most terrifying predators to appear on the Earth, vanished from North America."	B_I0
"The reading passage proposes three competing theories about Arctodus."	I_I0
"Unfortunately, the listening suggests that none of these speculations are convincing."	E_I0
"Firstly, the reading says that short faced bear could use its size to attack and pull  large mammals, such as buffalo, to the ground and make them fail to rise again to flee."	S_M0
"Conversely, the listening lecture thinks that this theory is impossible."	B_S1
"The evidence from the skeleton suggests that short-faced bear has thin front legs and the weak legs and paws cannot pull large mammals down to the ground."	E_S1
"Secondly, the reading passage contends that short-faced bear could reach speeds to catch up with deer and entelope, the stape food of Arctodus."	S_M0
"However, it is true that short-faced bear has long legs."	B_S0
"The listening proposes that modern deer and entelope can run fast with a sharp return."	I_S0
"The large size of the bears cannot enable them to change the direction quickly to catch up with the preys."	E_S0
"Finally, the reading claims that short-faced bear was a scavenger by using its size to intimidate the original hunters of dead preys."	S_M0
"On the contrary, the listening lecture says that the teeth of scavenger have some special marks, since the scavenger also eats hard bones of the dead animals."	B_S0
"And the teeth of short-faced bear were analyzed not to have such a mark."	I_S0
"Therefore, Arctodus could not be a scavenger."	E_S0

"Also parents know that the existing bad manners of the child or what qualities do their children lack of, then they teach them much more effectively than the teacher."	I_S0
"Schools have some qualified education experts, they know much more better than the parents of how to teach good manner and ethic, however, most of time when children stay in schools are mainly studying about their academic courses and prepare for their examines, they have no time to recieve those moral education."	I_S0
"what's more, children may feel reluctant to listen to some teacher or experts to tell them how to be a good person, because they may think it's none of their business."	I_S0

"In the passage, the author proposes 3 solutions that the international fund could help  to protect forests from being damaged by developing industries."	S_I0
"However, in the lecture, the professor totally disagree with the 3 solutions, and those strategies will not be helpful for protecting forests from deforestation."	S_T1
"Firstly, the passage suggest that using the internationally established forest protection fund to protect forest agriculture is perhaps the most important initiative."	S_M0
"By contrast, the professor argue that agriculture have many side effect to the ecosystem."	B_S0
"Nowadays, people are using high-tech implements in agriculture due to the rising population."	I_S0

"First of all, in that way children will benefit from their good grade in a material way."	S_M0
"Now lots of parents just praise their children when they get good mark or just think their children should have the good mark."	B_S0
"If their children fail in the exam, they will beat them or criticize them seriously."	I_S0
"Therefore, the children will feel lots of pressure during the exam because they are afraid of having a bad grade."	I_S0
"They study because of fearness."	I_S0
"On contrary, if the children can get some money because of their mark, they will have a disire to hardworking in order to acquire the money."	I_S0
"These children study because of encouragement."	I_S0
"The later absolutely have more power in studying than the former."	E_S0
"Secondly, offering children money could let them have a ability to manage their money."	S_M0
"Children can use these money to buy anying they want such as toys, a basketball or some vidio tapes."	B_S0
"When children get these money, they would not permit to ask extra money for entertainment so  they could form a habit to save money."	I_S0

"The goal of the parents who appeal to this kind of measure is no other than to let their children get  high grades in order to be admitted by a key school."	B_S0
"The original thought is not wrong."	I_S0
"However, this method can never draw students attention to the real study."	I_S0
"Instead, it leads children to concentrate more on the money they'll get."	I_S0
"In this case, children study hard not to fight for a bright future for themselves or to explore the world of knowledge, but to get the money to buy something they want."	I_S0
"It's of bad influence especially in the period when children are forming their own values."	I_S0
"So I deem it a bad idea to some extent."	E_S0

"Some individuals consider it true while others hold the view that sports facilities are of poor effects and the public should take other measures."	B_T0
"From my perspective, two opinions are reasonable to some extent because it depends on the varied people."	E_T0
"It is useful for those who are willing to do exercise to strengthen themselves with more sports facilities."	S_M1
"The reason is that increasing sports facilities can provide more opportunities for those who treat exerxise with enthuiasm."	B_S0
"For example, to those loving running, they used to take a run along the road which is dangerous and unexact."	I_S0
"Nevertheless,  when there are more runways, they can have safer and more professional exercise."	E_S0
"When it comes to those who prefer to stay at home, the way to increase sports facilities may be effectiveless."	S_M1
"The measure to improve their health is firstly arouse their interest in exercise."	B_S1
"To be specific, the authority can hold more activities to attract their attention on exercise and health in order to cultivate their sports aware."	E_S1

"And it is also close to the main road and railway line that linking Hidon and Cansdon,so there would be a large number of potential cusumers from these two towns."	E_I0
"Because of it‘s remote location,the rent would be much cheaper than other places."	S_T1
"By contrast,the second one is right in the town centre of Garlsdon,which is next to the middle point of the railway line,so consumers from Hindon and Cansdon could go there by train."	S_M2
"People from Bransdon(16 kilometers to south-west of Garlsdon)and Cransdon could go shopping by the main road as well,but the town centre is a no traffic zone,that could bring some inconveniences."	B_S2
"To sum up,both sites have merts and demerits,but the S1 may be the better choice."	E_S2
 
"Issues related to news have never failed to attract people's attention."	S_I0
"When it comes to the globle  events, recently a hotly debated topic has aroused among the public: whether people should pay attention to the events happening around the world, even they will not influence our daily life."	B_T0
"Some may hold the view that people unnecessarily have to know such things that do not affect themselves."	I_T0
"However, I believe that knowing the globle events, people can obtian some benefits about their own life."	E_T0
"First of all, learning events from other countries sometimes helps us to build up the sense of happiness."	S_M1
"To be specific, in the world, there are still many countries suffering the war or some countries cannot avoid the gunshot case."	B_S0
"As a result, as the people living in the peacce country, by comparing the environment, they will cherish the surroundings more and appriciate where they are living in."	I_S0
"And then, after knowing that many other people who are suffering some life danger can still strugle to live, the people in the safe conditions will be more hopeful for their life and feel more happiness."	I_S0

"In many countries , economic progress is their most significant goal."	S_T1
"However, some believe that other types of progress are equally important for a country."	B_S0
"I agree this view."	I_S0
"It is true that economic progress is essential to a country."	I_S0
"Firstly, economic progress may help a country to take an important role in the world."	I_S0
"If a country did not have enough money, other countries would not have a sense that this country is a deveoped country."	I_S0
"In addition, developments need money."	I_S0
"If a country did not have a goal of economic progress, the government would not get more profits, which  may lead to financial problem."	I_S0
"Without money, many develpments of a country cannot be achieved."	I_S0
"To be specific, if a country wanted to improve transport system, the governement should allocate funds on building new subway lines."	I_S0
"However, other types of progress are equally important for a country."	I_S0
"For example, the progress of quality of life of citizens is very significant."	I_S0
"There are several factors that relate to the quality of life."	I_S0
"To be specific, if pollution was a serious problem in that country, citizens would be troubled by pollution-related diseases,  which would make the quality of life worse."	I_S0
"Therefore, according to the quality of life of citizens, people can identify some problem in that country, and the improvement of quality of life just means the country become more develped and an increasing number of people would like to live in that country."	I_S0

"A large number of people hold the view that goverment should put more attention and money on developing the economy instead of protecting wild animals and wilderness areas."	I_I0
"However, compared to the economic changes, in my personal level, it is more benificial to protect animals and wild areas."	I_I0
"Thus I suppor several reasons for my opinion."	E_I0
"First, protecting the wild animals is a significant way to improve the knowledge people gain."	S_M1
"The population of wild aniamls are declining."	B_S0
"Some specially valuable animals , such as, the panda."	I_S0
"The population of wild panda are fewer and fewer because of the increases of urban development."	I_S0
"People set the officials and farmers ."	I_S0
"These huge factory took the wild place where the panda lived."	I_S0
"The rare animal has to remove into the country."	I_S0
"The data from a research shown there are nine thousands of university students knew the animal from picture and book but they nerver see the real panda in person."	I_S0
"Goverment should protect the panda in order to expand cicilians' knowledge."	E_S0
"Second,protectting wild areas is a insurance to the health of civilians."	S_M1
"It is ture that there are many enviormental pollution around the world,such as, the fog and haze that appear in China."	B_S0
"Chinese local goverment had produced lots of laws to protect the healthy level of civilians."	I_S0
"However, the rapid development of economy and agricuture reduce the clean air and river of wild areas."	I_S0
"The research was done by the Beijing university has shown that there are eighty percents of Chinese urban areas, the people live in the urban enviorment are easier to get sick ,such as, get a cold,than the people eho live in the countryside which is close to the nature."	E_S0
"Based on the two reasons, expanding the knowledge of civilians and protectting the health pf civilians both shown the meaning of protect wild animals and awild areas are also benefial for our socialty"	O

"Some people think they have negative thoughts on studying but I cannot totally agree with this point."	B_S0
"These people think young students are leaving schools because of hating."	I_S0
"They think students do not concentrate on their studying and are effected by entertainment."	I_S0
"I see this point, there are lots of students are fond of playing computer games or waching TV that is the main reason why they are leaving school."	I_S0
"On the other hand,  I think amout of students are leaving school with positive thoughts."	I_S0
"Not everyone is good at studying, maybe some students have other hobbies or specilalities."	I_S0
"They do not want to waste time on stduying, they can do some significative things, such as finding a job."	I_S0
"They can work out earlier and they can have more working experience."	I_S0
"For the causes of the phenomenon, I think that can be illustated in two sides."	I_S0
"One of the causes is family teaching."	I_S0
"In some families, parents is very busy, they do not have time to pay attention to students's studying."	I_S0
"No one to manage children's time and studying, that will make these young students are ware of studying."	I_S0
"The other cause is studying environment."	I_S0
"Some of students studying in some terrible classes, in these type of classes, none of people concentrate on studying."	I_S0
"For example, it is news I read last week."	I_S0
"A student studied in  a terrilble class, his classmates asked him to smoke and play computer games."	I_S0
"For a period of time, this student became to bad student."	I_S0
"Therefore, I will give some suggestions to improve the situation."	I_S0
"I think parents should spend more time with their children and tell them studying is very important for their future."	I_S0
"In school, teacher should manage their children and improve students' interest of studying."	I_S0
"To sum up, everyone should have education, studying is an important part of their life."	I_S0
"If people study more, they can do better when they graduated from universities."	E_S0

"In many countries today, it is common for young people to work or travel or do other things after graduation."	S_I0
"Even in China, a country with a very different culture from the west, there are many young people choose to take a year off after graduation."	S_T0
"This may be because they want to experience the society after graduation, students always stay at school and home in the past, they can't experience what their parents have experienced, which may be a pity for a person's growth."	S_M1
"So, after graduation to work, to deal with managers, bosses, customers can get good communication skills."	B_S0
"On the other hand, you can also travel, make plans, communicate with local people and negotiate with tourism agencies, which can also improve yourself."	I_S0
"These must be things you can't learn at school or at home."	E_S0
"However, there are some disadvantages to be noticed."	S_M1
"Young people may feel uncomfortable going back to school after a gap of a year, or may feel that going to school is better than working earlier."	B_S1
"However, one thing to remind them is that a high degree is very important for finding a good job in today's society, if they choose to drop out of school, it means they will lose a lot of opportunities."	E_S1
"In my opinion,young people should go to experience the society, which can not only broaden their horizons, but also make them understand that happiness does not come easily."	B_C1
"Only when they understand the reality of this society, they will have stronger motivation to study and struggle, instead of playing games in the college dormitory every day."	E_C1
 
"I agreed with this idea."	S_T1
"The worker should have different things to do while they are working and they will be more satisfied with their jobs."	S_T0
"First,if a worker always do a simple job at work,they will get bored soon."	S_M0
"Just imagine you are doing the same things all day such as cleaning the windows,pick up the things on the tables,answer the phone,it is very terrible."	B_S1

"From my perspective opinon,I agree that  parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from it."	B_T0
"And the reasons are as follows."	E_T0
"Firstly,it is universally acknowledged that mistakes can bring lessons for somebody and then he or she will have the specific experience about this area,which is the same with children."	S_T1
"When they make mistakes,they would learn a lot and behave better in their future."	S_T0
"To be brief,this theory is a commom belief when encountering falure or small mistakes."	S_T1
"What's more,children need to be independent and experience by themselves to know how to do and how to do well."	S_M1
"this can bring them much courage and let them  be more stronger."	B_S1
"If parents help them with their whole knowledge and experiments,children may be lazy and could not think independently and actively."	E_S1
"Simultaneously,if parents let children make mistakes,it can create an atmosphere which is full of love and belief."	S_M1
"Children may feel more comfortable and will be more emthusiastic to handle the problem."	B_S1

"So the question of whenther more TV channels is good for us or not is worth debating."	I_S0
"More channels for sure means more programmes, but there is only a certain amount of things that deserves to be transformed into a programme."	I_S0
"When there're more and more programme begins to be shown, no doubt that some of them will have similar content, leading to a waste of time watching the show."	I_S0

"To complete the compulsory course faster and better, many parents pay considrably to the institute."	I_S0
"And, to help their children do better, parents may spend energy on commuting, guiding children, and checking the information about the voluntary job vacancies."	I_S0
"Some people believed that high school students should have the experience of doing community service to make them more responsible and competitive in the future."	I_S0
"However, the students who really enjoy doing such programs will certainly stand out in these fields with a lot of working experience in community service regardless of whether it is compulsory."	I_S0

"Admittedly,students from poor families or rural areas are educationally inferior to those who grow up in cities."	S_M1
"They may not have enough money to purchase books and their schools may not be able to afford expensive equipment for some scientific experiments."	B_S1
"These justify the fact that pupils from rural areas are potentially have bigger possibilities to obtain lower marks in final exams,regardless of their learning ability."	E_S1

"Another advantage involves that this progress has increased people's happiness."	S_M0
"Now people live longer and have more time to spend with their families and friends."	B_S1
"They can feel the beauty of the world, and have more time to do what they want to do and realize their dreams."	E_S1
"In addition, medical care is now playing an increasingly important role in our daily life and we can't live without it."	S_M0

"Fist and the foremost, the point is that planning can never include all the accidents."	S_M0
"I always can't concentrate many things in the same period and always screw up the things."	B_S0

"I have lost my passion to encourage myself to chase my dream, I have made every part of my life in a mess, but I still have to stick on it, becanse no one can really help me to do these things."	I_S0
"So it's really less things that I can do well."	E_S0
"What‘s more is, focusing one thing at a time can results a better result."	S_M0
"Because we can always know that if you drunk yourself in the study you can get good grades, expecially the college final exams."	B_S0
"I am not a regular student that take the class routine, but I can get good grades in the exams, on the opposite, one of my roommates always feel strange why I can overpass her."	I_S0
"The only reason is that I always copy the notes of the class before the test day for about one week."	I_S0
"I only let myself in the library for a couple of days without any communication with others."	I_S0
"I do many improtant works before the test to find out the point that teacher want to test."	I_S0
"Needless to say, I always forget after the test but it's really useful for the test."	E_S0
"Last but not the least, to find your own way is a top way to solve many accidents, reaserchers once said the mpst people do poor jobs under the multiple conditions, they can never know how big potential they have, only when you are under the stress will your ability can be inspired to do many things."	S_M0

"These is a positive way for many people and for myself is a mode that I want to achieve in the future."	E_C1
 
"Nowadays, communication has become more and more developed but I think the online communities does more harm than good."	S_T1

"Due to the casual nature of online communities, some people have weak legal, they abused people casually, that is illegal."	I_S0
"Cheat others on the internet to achieve their own ends, these are all crimes."	I_S0
"Finally, online communities change people's values."	I_S0

"This is because the the speed of internet make people are more willing to stay at home, which lead to the fact that most of people do not have chance to have a look at the increased facilities."	B_S1
"Besize,if governments put more excercising essaies and persuide people on the internet ,people can more likely to be encouraged."	E_S1
"In my opinon, the other measures like building  more big parks could also make a big contribution on people's health."	S_M0

"Thirdlly,students may feel stressed nowadays."	I_S0
"Under the stress from the society,some students may don't want to study in the school anymore but to find a job."	I_S0
"So,how do we dea with it."	I_S0
"As fa as I am concerned, it's the most important that the parties can realize the importance of studying."	I_S0
"It they realized this,they will make every efforts to study."	I_S0
"Furthermore,the government should take some measures to supply the better atmosphere for students and punish those who forbidden their children to go to school."	I_S0

"First of all,the audiences have more choices."	I_S0
"For instance,the elders like watching dating shows and anti-Japenese play,the young are intersted in watching TV plays,little children like the catoon."	I_S0
"If there are few TV programs,people will lost many inerests and thy must choose the TV channels that they do not like ,so it's a really serious problem."	I_S0
"In my view,more TV channels means that there are a wide variety of age groups."	I_S0
"Peope will not choose what they do not like."	I_S0
"In addition,there are more people will lost job."	I_S0
"Fewer shows means fewer jobs for people who are good at editing,and fewer jobs for actors."	I_S0
"That also means that more competition from universities such as drama school."	I_S0
"There are many actors who cannot show their acting ability."	I_S0
"Also, the children can not see a lot of cartoons,they can only watch a few cartoons,then thay will feel very boring."	I_S0
"Those variety shows will be less,our life will be much less joy."	I_S0

"With more new products and more way of doing advertising, people can get to know about more products."	I_S0
"Therefore, every individual has more choices to make instead of buying the same and even old fashion products."	E_S0
"Advertisements are a means of competitions which will stimulate people to be more different."	S_M1
"It is the era when the products iterate more and more frequently."	B_S0
"A replication of other people's work will not make one successful."	I_S0
"Instead, being different and innovative is the key to success."	I_S0
"What are shown in the advertisements are symbolic of other people's work."	I_S0
"In order to capture the market, one is supposed to invent or create something different that can excel the existing products."	I_S0
"Hence, people need to think more differently instead of being the same."	E_S0
"Overall, instead of inducing people to buy the same products, advertisements will be more likely offer various options for the consumers."	B_C1
"Additionally, advertisements will stimulate people to be more different individuals."	E_C1

"In recent years, more and more adults casually deal with their money."	B_I0
"For instance,  many young women will buy whatever they like on the Internet stores regardless the prices and their salary."	E_I0
"Therefore, it will surely lead to no deposit for them to deal with the future."	B_T0
"In my point of view, however, in order to become a financially responsible adults, we are supposed to learn how to manage our own money when we are at young age."	E_T0
"As we know, childhood is one of the most crucial periods of a person, during which a person will form its values of the world."	S_M0

"Nowadays there is a popular issue that whether it is the core of improving the education of universities by spending more money on salaries for professors of universities."	I_I0
"And this evoked an drastic debate among people."	I_I0
"Some of them hold that colleges should not spend more money on the salary of professors bacause they are already have a higher salary than many peopple in other professions."	E_I0
"In mt opinion, however, it must be difinitely for professor to have a higher salary, and my reasons are given below."	S_T0
"Although spending more money on the salaries for universities professors could cause a problem or even a shortage to the college a economic pressure, this would be still worthwhile sacrifice for a better education of all of students."	B_M0
"First and foremost, the professors would like to have more patience and being more likely to help students."	E_M0

"i have some thinking in this: you have a normal price they can believe you,and other is the price are so  expensive."	S_T1
"Some people think have a high grade is great , that i think is great too, because if some school have high grade, than they have some good experience, for example some good school like wuhan second school, that is very great school, and that grade is hight too, but some parents like this school to ,because this school is very good, so the grade is hight, than the people go to this school, however i have this ways but i have another way to support the instead ways."	S_S2
"Firstly, i think the high grade they get it school is not great, because some parents think the grade is hight they can't believe these school , for instance some poor familary their children have a high grace but they money have not good so many parent looks some good school money they are afraid, and than they can't believe that this is school price, so ,i think this is a good example to in this way, so i diaagree this statement."	B_M1
"Second, i have another ways to evidence to this ways is not good, like some not farmes school have expensive grade , thrir familary are very afraid , to illstrate some parents are not know the school ,but some school havae a high grade to introduce some students go in there school, so many people and parents can't take enough money."

"In addition, with the modern medical care focusing more on psychological diseases that were ignored, it can help people turn more positively towards their life."	E_S0
"Nevertheless, just as the saying goes, ' every coin has two sides'."	S_M1
"At the same point of bringing us advantages, development of medical care also has some bad sides."	B_S0
"First and foremost, long life span leads to an expanding population of the elderly, which is a great burden to both individual family and national welfare."	I_S0
"Besides, the phenomenon of labour shortage is being more common all over the world, like Europe and Japan."	I_S0
"This is destuctive to a country's economy, even influcing the world."	E_S0

"For example,if you haven't give your school-age child money,in the school,child will look at his friend buy food,drink and something else,he will be very upset because he haven't money to shopping with his friend,prehaps he will get the money by a worry way."	B_S1
"So,I think it is important to give money to school children."	E_S1
"However,some parents are worry about that if their children buy something useless like put money in the games."	S_M1
"School-age children haven't a very good ability of make a dicision,but we can give school-age children 10 dollars a week,so they can control them to ues money,but not use it in something useless."	S_S2
"In a word I think that parents should give money to school-age children,and this is undoubt good for the children."	S_C2
 
"As time goes by,instead of work for others,many people find a new choice that being self-employed,which someone could do work for himself and receive achievement."	B_S0
"Confronted with this situation,there are reasons to explain."	I_S0
"First of all,self-employment must be the fabulous way to achieve ones own gain,because only the one knows what he wants to do,and how much effort he should do."	I_S0
"Further more,a large quantity of graduates are seeking for suitable jobs."	I_S0
"On the contrary,there are not enough occupations for them, so they always have a great problem to find jobs and can not live with them own."	I_S0
"Last but not least,government also introduces relative policies to encourage start up business."	E_S0
"Unfortunately,there are some disadvantages of being self-employed."	S_S2
 
"Currently, people take more attaching improtance to focus on improving the environment."	S_T1
"Some citizens think  one person is unable to resolve the circumstances problems,only the offical and 
giant companies benefit the issues."	B_S0
"From my perspective, I disgree with that."	I_S0
"The government  can tackle the problems."	I_S0
"Due to the reason that it is more effective to manage the environmental issues througth the government capcity."	I_S0
"For example,setting a law to limits the car emissions dailyand lessens the traffic jam."	I_S0
"And punishing the unruly company emits the drity water into the local river breaking down the eco-systems."	I_S0
"In trems of some international companies are beneficial to the environmental worring trend."	I_S0
"Becaues they are able to govern the pollutions and advocate protection of environment."	I_S0
"To be more specific,they should do that as reservation of circumstances benefit their themself development in a long-term process."	I_S0
"Such as advocating low-carbon ideas in various sphere like travelling or using of green car."	I_S0
"It is not only  contribute on their future but also our society."	I_S0
"As for individuals I believe that it is not unnecessary."	I_S0
"For promoting the environment , human being are responsible for  the questions due to the reason that every one 's power  cannot ignore."	I_S0
"For instance, people behave themself in order to lessen rubbish for environment's organizaton."	I_S0
"On the other hand, citizens can point out where need to address."	I_S0

"Nevertheless, others disagree with such ieda, interpreting that waste recycling is not a person's duty."	S_T0
"For my part, governments ought to set relative laws and each person should have the awareness to make contribution for our earth."	S_T1
"There are several factors that could explain such thoughts."	S_M1
"Based on the survey in Harvard University, 67.12% people take it for granted that recycling is a trouble for governments to make as a legal requirement."	B_S0
"Due to the control of power and money in relative department' hands, political members, especially the presidents take care of enviromental problems for their citizens or villagers."	I_S0
"However, the only method to improve the problem of waste is unrealistic."	I_S0
"If the residents had no consciousness to clarify different waste,such as rest rice or plastic bottle, the situation would not be changed in a short term."	I_S0
"For one thing, the population of ordinary people is more than govenrment members."	I_S0
"For another, once the law rules were set, all of us should obey instead of ignoring."	I_S0
"Hence, the factor that governments to make a legal requirement is not enogh."	E_S0
"To some extent."	S_M1
"it is indispensible for laws to maintain the order to increase recyclying."	B_S0
"But each one should take the formation of recycling into consideration."	I_S0
"Only combining the laws, governments' action and individual efforts can we solve the problem of waste recycling in the long run."	E_S0
 
"In my opinion,I suggest laws should to make people recycle of waste."	S_T1
"It is very important to do that the government make legal requirement."	B_S0
"the legal can help us that our life can be more wander,let our life have a great process."	I_S0
"A excellent legal requirement can make our life more soft which can help for our life,and reduce someone who break the waste from homes."	I_S0
"Many people easy to overlook the waste from homes,but it is must to recycled the government to make it."	I_S0
"If the government make not it a legal requirement."	I_S0
"Our waste may be was not good for us."	I_S0
"In fact,there many person are not aquire knowledge about the waste,we should make more advatise on waste from homes,and the eduvtion also"	E_S0

"Salmon eggs are arrenged under reeds covered by many small stones at the upper river because water flowing in this place always move slowly."	S_M1
"After 5 to 6 months the eggs can grow into fries whose bodies are 3 to 8 centimeters in long."	B_S0
"The fries will swim to the lower river where water flows fast and they will grow into smolts which are 12 to 15 centimeters in long during approximately 4 years."	I_S0
"Then the smolts will swim to the open sea and grow up."	I_S0

"Some people hold the view that failure is the meaning whenever they could not be successful."	S_M1
"Thus, if meeting with failure, they will feel so nervous that they have no idea what they are supposed to do."	B_S1
"As time goes by, they become more and more dispirited while eventually, they could do nothing well."	E_S1
"On the contrary, there are some people tending to believe another idea."	S_M1
"From their point of view, failure is outstanding due to the fact that it can give them plenty of encouragement."	B_S1
"Therefore, if facing failure, they will be quite courageous and then try their best to beat it, finally, they make their dream come true."	E_S1
 
"Now,more and more students who are in in diferrent grades are leaving schools because they feel negative and not happy with their studying."	S_T1
"To this situation,I think it's caused by a number of reasons."	B_S0
"First,modern students are as bravely and positive as their parents and grandpa."	I_S0
"So,when they are in a terrible situation,they can't fight with it with a breavely heart."	I_S0
"Second,the modern society gives them more press."	I_S0
"In high press,students who are in a poor thoughts are easy to lose their confidence and belief."	I_S0
"In order to improve the situation,I have some advice."	I_S0
"First the school could visit a psythlist to make a speech about how to reduce press for students."	I_S0
"In this way,we can improve students' thoughts."	I_S0
"Second,teahers and families should give children more courage."	I_S0
"Although sometimes they can't get a good grades,we should still courage them."	I_S0
"By this,students would study harder and do not feel negative on studying."	I_S0
"What's more,the state of edducation should change the style of teaching students."	I_S0
"Because,not only studying is important but also skills,experience and so on are importent too."	I_S0
"I have ever heard a tale."	I_S0
"A boy who are about 11 years old are often laughted by his classmates and teachers because of his poor IQ."	I_S0
"But his mother don't give up."	I_S0
"She give him courage and belief."	I_S0

"For most contries in the world, persuing economic progress is vital to the governments."	S_I0
"However, there are still some other aspects that are equally import to a country."	B_T0
"There is no doubt that acheiving economics goal is important to a country, because economics determines the wealth of a country."	E_T0
"Prosperous ecomomics shows that the individuals live with high standard."	S_T1
"A country with great economics also illustrates the low unemplyment rate, leading to less poor people."	B_S0
"Living in a rich country means there are more business opportunities, which bring a large quantity of working places."	I_S0
"Therefore, ecomomic progress is significant to many governments."	E_S0
"But there are still some other kinds of progress that are important for a country."	S_M1
"For instance, the medical treatment is also an unignorant part to the government."	B_S0
"If the country do not pay attention to the construction of medical system, there are a great number  of people who can not get cured in time."	I_S0

"There has been a controversy whether government should spend more monsy on railways than roads."	S_I0
"And from my own perspective, I agree with that."	S_T0
"First of all, with the development of economy, more and more people have the ability to buy private car."	S_M0
"As a result, the number of accidents and taffic jams has increased significantly, especially during the morning and evening rush hours."	B_S0
"But the subway can solve these problems easily."	I_S0
"the railway does not cause congestion and the possibilty of an accident is low."	E_S0
"What is more, because of the decrease of available land, parking pots become fewer and fewer, parking has become a headache for many people."	S_M0
"For example, many people prefer to go to work by subway rather than by car, sometimes it takes only 10 mintues to drive to work, but it takes 20 minutes to find a parking space and be late at last."	S_S2
"Last but not least, the subway is a kind of public transportation and is  more environmentally friendly."	S_M0
"If government spend more mony to develop road,  people will have a stronger desire to buy private cars, air pollution will be more serious."	B_S0
"Actually, for a city, air quality is very important, this is why Singapore is famous as a garden city."	I_S0
"In addition, the development of public transportation can reflect a country's economy to some extent."	I_S0
"The subway can bring convenience to people."	E_S0
"Subway is significant to both country and people."	B_C1
"It is necessary for government to develop the railways, the return will outweigh the effort."	E_C1
 
"I don't think having more TV channels is a good idea."	B_T1
"Because lot's of time will be wasted in swithing diffrent channels mindlessly."	E_T1

"I think it is not good idea."	B_T0
"I have two reasons."	E_T0
"First of all,I think chirldren don't need too much money."	S_T1
"because when they study in the school."	B_S0
"they spend most of time in the study."	I_S0
"so they have not chance to spend money."	I_S0
"some high grade children maybe need some money."	I_S0
"but they were buzy."	I_S0
"so they have to study very were and study for a long time."	I_S0
"if some parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school."	I_S0
"I think the children were lazy."	I_S0
"they spend money on the everyting."	I_S0
"so they have less and less time to study."	E_S0
"Secondly,I think some parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school is not good idea."	S_M2
"Because if parents do it."	B_S0
"the children would get some bad habits."	I_S0
"for example,some student like computer games."	I_S0
"but they don't have money to get the computer or play in the net bar."	I_S0
"if the parents give they money."	I_S0
"they can playing computer games."	I_S0
"finally,they mark was bad."	I_S0
"if children have a lot of money."	I_S0
"more and more student would spent time to playing others."	E_S0

"The arguement of whether some positions should earn a higher salary than others has always existed."	S_T1
"Though in a same company or industry, people recieve different payments according to the importance of their jobs, which often causes voices to complain of unfairness."	B_S0
"Positions that include management are usually the biggest target."	I_S0
"It might seem to be a discrimination, as the heaviness of wages includes a significant difference, and everyone in the company works for a certain number of hours, but I impose to this opinion."	I_S0
"Though the gap cannot be too wide, there should be a reasonable gap between salaries."	I_S0
"First of all, senior management positions require a higher qualification and advanced skills."	I_S0
"This is not based only on physical matters, but also cognitive ones, which in turn decide how the company is supposed to achieve goals in the future."	I_S0
"High salaries should be provided, because the stress that these people experiece are much bigger than workers in other sectors - the weight of a company or organisation's future depends on them."	I_S0
"Another reason that I agree on the perception of senior management positions earning more than other workers is because this gives everyone a motive to work harder."	I_S0
"People that do not have the ability to have such jobs may choose to practice and enhance their skills, hoping that a rise in position might be granted."	I_S0
"People that are situated in these places may choose to use this as an incentive - in order to mantain their higher wages, they complete more tasks for the company."	I_S0
"Last but not least, companies and organisations face competition, as there are very limited labour resources for people in the management area."	I_S0
"In order to catch a skillful person's attention, a high salary must be provided."	I_S0
"Compared to this position, the number of people who are capable of producing and functioning in other sections is bigger and more available to companies -  therefore a lower salary is paid towards them."	I_S0
"The significance of positions differ, and this cannot be easily altered."	I_S0
"However, a salary too high in contrast to others in the same company is also not a favourable option."	I_S0
"Since people in senior management positions are very limited resources and  experience a heavier burden of stress , and because the action of wage differentiation gives an incentive to both sides, I agree that higher salaries should be provided for those in senior management positions than those situated differently in the same company or organisation."

"In second place, there may be better ways  of solution this problem."	I_S0
"For example, the goverment should publicize the knowledge that sports exercises bring health,and establish more running compitition to encourage peolpe to take part."	I_S0

"If a company or organisation meet some problems,they didin't to ask workers what should they do,they will ask senior management."	I_S0

"Maybe other worker can help do some things,but we need know they must be directed by senior management."	I_S0

"The reading presents three reasons to prove the idea that irradiating food products is unsafe and harmful which is wrong。The lecture,however,challenges what the reading contends by stating that the food may have some problems to people."	S_T1
"First,the reading indicates that the products are exposed to low amounts of radiation, which is completely harmless to humans."	S_M0
"Yet the lecture argues that We can't make sure that all the fungi are killed."	B_S0
"Even if there is only a little residue, it is possible to reproduce more fungi."	I_S0

"Second,the reading suggests that Another advantage of irradiation is that it slows the process by which food spoils."	S_M0
"Oppositely,the lecture points out that Food radiation slows down the rate of food ripening, but it can cause food to lose vitamins and minerals."	S_S2
"Third,the reading expresses that foods suffer hardly any losses in their nutritional value when they are exposed to radiation."	S_M0

"Although this phenonmenon is irreversible for human beings,it is only one of many environmental problems,not the most urgent,for recent global climate change,environmental pollution,deforestation and soilerosion, the locals even can't get enough water for survival in the dry season."	E_S1
"Due to the increasing scale of human production activities,global warming will have various impacts on the world."	S_M1
"On the one hand,higher temperatures can melt polar glaciers,which resulting in sea levels will rise by 6 cm every 10 years and some coastal areas will be flooded."	B_S0
"At the other hand,It will also affect changes in rainfall and atmospheric circulation,which make the climate abnormal, and easily lead to droughts and floods."	I_S0
"These may cause changes and damage to the ecosystem."	I_S0

"In 1938 an archaeologist in Iraq acquired a set of clay jars that had been excavated two years earlier by villagers constructing a railroad line."	B_I0
"The vessel was about 2,200 years old."	I_I0
"Each clay jay contained a copper cylinder surrounding an iron rod."	I_I0
"The archaeologist proposed that vessel were ancient electric batteries and even demonstrated that they can produce a small electric current when filled with some liquids."	E_I0
"However, it is not likely that the vessels were actually used as electric batteries in ancient times."	S_T1
"First of all, if the vessels were used as batteries, they would probably have been attached to some electricity conductors such as metal wires."	S_M0
"But there is no evidence that any metal wires were located near the vessels."	B_S1
"All that has been excavated are the vessels themselves."	E_S1
"Second, the copper cylinders inside the jars look exactly like copper cylinders discovered in the ruins of Seleucia, an ancient city located nearby."	S_M0
"We know that the copper cylinders from Seleucia were used for holding scrolls of sacred texts, not for generating electricity."	B_S0
"Since the cylinders found with the jars have the same shape, it is very likely they were used for holding scrolls as well."	I_S0
"That no scrolls were found inside the jars can be explained by the fact that the scrolls simply disintegrated over the centuries."	E_S0
"Finally, what could ancient people have done with the electricity that the vessels were supposed to have generated?"	S_M0
"They had no devices that replied on electricity."	B_S1

"In my opnion,it is a good trend in our country."	I_S0
"In today's world,railway is an important part of our transport system."	I_S0
"First of all,it is more convenivent than road system."	I_S0
"For example,people do not need to wait subways for too much time,and people also can spend shorter time travelling to destinations,bu subways than by traditional road system."	I_S0
"In addition,compared with traditional road network,railway transportation can reduce air pollution in people's living and working environment."	I_S0
"In details,with the reducing use of private car, CO2 emission is cut down gradually,which is benefical for people's body."	I_S0
"Last but not least,railway system decrease the traffic pressure on road system greatly."	I_S0
"Nowadays,an increasing number of people choose to take subways instead of driving their private cars,which will decrease the number of cars on the road and make public transport system more efficient."	I_S0
"On the other hand,it is necessary for us yo have the traditional road transportation."	I_S0
"For instance,there are many heavy goods with huge size."	I_S0
"which result in the inconvenience of transmitting by railway system."	I_S0
"people must deliver there things by big ruck through the highway transportation."	I_S0
"As the asme time, in order to avoid some unnecessary trobles and accidents,passages are forbidden to have some inpoper behaiors,such as eating and travelling with pets,when they aer taking subway so as to ensure public health."	I_S0
"By contrast,people are little restricted by there regulations and rules when they are driving their cars."	I_S0
"All in all,in spite of the fact that the two transportation systems own their advantages,i stll think that railway system is better than road system."	I_S0
"because compared with conventional road transport,rail transportation is increasingly popular,and it is a more obvious trend that people choose to travel by railway system,which brings a great deal of convenience and progress to many regions."	E_S0

"The relationship between children's development and family is the biggest."	B_T1
"First of all, I think the impact of the original family on children is the biggest."	E_T1
"Parents' behavior, thoughts and ways of dealing can be part of their teaching."	S_T0
"The thoughts of parents determine the thoughts of children."	B_S0
"And children will basically live with their elders as soon as they are born, which means that children's behavior and ideas will be influenced by their family and will be accompanied by them for a lifetime."	I_S0
"Parents are the closest people to their children, so children often trust and respect their parents' behaviors unconditionally, and the influence they receive outside the home is obviously far less than that they receive at home."	E_S0
"For example, if a child is used to being praised and praised by his parents when he was young, even if he fails, he will not be more critical, so the child must be very optimistic and confident."	S_M1
"After growing up, it will be the same in the society."	B_S0
"Such a character has a great influence on his development, and it is difficult to be changed by the society because of his childhood."	I_S0
"And his good development is due to influence of his family,not the influence outside from home."	E_S0
"On the contrary, if parents scold their children when they are young, they like to fight and scold when they do something wrong."	S_M1
"Even if they get good grades, they won't praise them."	B_S0
"Then the child must be self abased and introverted."	I_S0
"Even if such a child has excellent grades, he will still feel inferior in heart, and it is difficult to achieve great achievements in society."	I_S0
"The external experience will not change him, and such influence will accompany him for life."	E_S0
"Therefore, the influence of the original family and parents is very important for the child, and it is also the most powerful influence in his life."	B_C0
"No matter how big the external influence is, for the child, he cannot forget the influence brought by his parents."	I_C0
"Home is the harbor of a person's birth and growth."	I_C0
"How can we say that the external influence is more important to his development."	E_C0
 
"There is a universail consensus that it is benificial for us to grasp a foreign language."	S_I0
"However, the reason why we ought to learn an alien language engenders a widely controvers."	S_T1
"Some people hold a practical view that a foreigen language solely contributes to enhance our communication ability during  vacation  or work in alien countries."	S_M1
"A typical example is that our adaptive capacity  may play a significant role in our daily life when going abroad for further study ,thus mastering the  local languange is apparently indispensable wherever you go and whatever delemma you encounter."	B_S1
"In addition,If people working or travaling in foreign countries are unable to communicate with natives ,it could be an bitter suffering."	E_S1
"On the contrary,others may be proponents that learning a foreign language brings us multiple advantages simultaneously."	S_M1
"Initially, a numorous of articals and thesises published by authorities which major in different acadmic sectors are written in their local language ,such as English."	B_S0
"Consequently,there is no exaggerating to say that grasping a foreign laguage helps people who are doing acadmic studies  absorb specialized knowledge all over the world."	I_S0
"Further more,learning a foreign language is alde an effecient way to comprehend the corresponding culture."	I_S0
"It is quite hard to learn Chinese because it iherits the characteristic of Chinese history."	E_S0
"From my perspective, l mainly agree with learning a foreign language brings us diverse merits."	S_C2

"Passage thinks that there are three versions of the disappearance of Harappa people, but lecture says that all three versions are problematic."	E_I0
"The first idea of passage was that the Harappans were conquered by foreign invaders, because the Aryans began to enter the Harappan territory in 1500 BC."	S_M0
"But lecture said there was no evidence that the Harappans had been invaded."	S_S2
"The second law of passage is because of nature."	S_M0

"As far as I am concerned, the merits of taking a gap year outweign its demerits."	I_S0
"The reaon why I think the merits of taking a gap year outweign its demerits is that gap years make students' experience colorful."	I_S0
"They can join in the society and learn a lot of knowledge outside textbooks."	I_S0
"For example, they can travel to a small and poor village, and there are a number of teenagers as them are not able to accept good education."	I_S0
"Compared with those teenagers who are not well-educated, they will konw the meaning of going to college, and it is pretty useful for them to learn a series of knowledge about how to take good care of themselves during the travel."	I_S0
"The another reason is that students are hard to know which major they really like."	I_S0
"So, they can spend time doing various works in different fields and it is clear for them what major is suitable for them or not."	I_S0
"There will not be seen the phenomenon that parents replace students to choose a major that students are less interest about it."	I_S0
"As metioned above, I hold the belief that taking a gap year is of benefit for students."	I_S0
"What is worth mentioning is that they go out from an ivory tower and make clear the real world."	I_S0
"There is no doubt that gap year is benificial for students."	E_S0
 
"People are some how complicated , but there still ways to learn about them,such as their habbits and interest.."	S_I0

"I think the former groups of people are correct."	S_T0
"Frist,the books and movies are created by people,a person may reading or watching them for the reason of  the perticular writer or film maker."	S_M1
"By understanding the reason that a person initial motivation to read the book and watch the movie can reveal a lot more than their favorite author or derictor."	B_S0
"For example, i like the moive 'shadoe' created by famous derictor Zhang Yimo, just for his use of black and white colors in the movie."	I_S0
"And the reason i like the use od the colors  is becauce it is similar to the  traditional Chinese painting i like."	I_S0
"So i t can learn my other interest."	E_S0
"Secondly,types of books and movies can help we figure out a person's state of mind or the things he or she is going through.."	S_M1

"As we all know, the reason why electricity is generated in a hydroelectric power station is complecated."	B_T1
"Here are steps about how it works."	I_T1
"First of all, there is a High-level reservoir which is made by a certain river."	I_T1
"what's more , Dam is settle on the end of the reservoir to make sure that the water we collect can not be flowed eventually."	I_T1
"But the Dam we set need to have a gap between the ground."	E_T1
"We call that Intake."	B_S0
"It's an automatic gap actually, open in bright close in night."	I_S0
"The function of the gap is to let the flowing water run across the fan then generate electricity."	I_S0
"The rest of water which can not be blow will go through the Low level reservoir."	I_S0
"Accordingly, Generator will release National grid by power lines."	I_S0
"Addationally, during night, as I mentioned before, the Dam will get close so that no more water can be flowed."	I_S0
"On the conversy, water from Low-level reservoir will go through the fan and then reserve in the pump."	E_S0
"Above all , it's an environmental way to do, and I think it deserve to be used widely in the world."	S_M2
"This is how electricity is generated in a hydroelectric power station."	S_S2
 
"From 1985 to 2002, three things changed the most: Kitchen and organic waste, paper and miscellaneous."	S_T1
"Less demand for wood means people are using more energy to heat and generate electricity, reducing the destruction of forests."	B_S0
"In the same way, paper is also a plant-based supplies, reduce the use of, is to reduce the possibility of desertification."	I_S0
"The increase in food waste means that people's living standards have improved and there are more choices available."	I_S0

"Firstly, contrary to the reading that Chevalier was poor otherwise he did not need to borrow money, the lecture points out that borrowing money does not mean anything."	S_M0
"It is confirmed that Chevalier took part in parties and gambling with fortune in form of estate."	B_S1
"In this case, Chevalier needed several days to sell these estate within this period he had to borrow money from others."	E_S1
"Secondly, as the reading describs, Chevalier could not remember exact details in conversations with Voltair happened many years ago."	S_M0
"However, the lecture proposes that actually he could do so."	B_S0

"Also, his servant confirmed that as the time Chevalier wrote memoir, he took out notes and ideas in order to review these conversations."	E_S0
"Thirdly, the reading combines that it was more likely for Chevalier to get rid of torture of prison with bribe assisted by his friends rather than escape."	S_M0

"Considering the fact that some of his well-connected friends were also in prison whereas did not return to free."	I_S0

"We can discuss this problem in three aspects."	I_S0
"Ffistly, it is common that many teenagers who just graduted not long ago are not sure about what kind of subject they would like to major in or  whether they really want to go to the collage."	I_S0
"Absolutely it is an important choice for any high school graduates ."	I_S0
"Gap year gives them  relatively long time to consider about this."	I_S0
"It is said that university is a small society."	I_S0
"Thus,It is wise to work sometimes before going into an unknown field."	I_S0
"The high school gradutas who have been lived in a simple atmosphere for above ten years and I am not sure they can understand the complex society if they do not have time to experenice the real society ."	I_S0
"So,another advantage of taking gap year is that can give them more time to get used to a different world."	I_S0
"As far as I am concerned , the advantage og taking one year off outweigh the disadvantage."	I_S0

"At this time, developed countries should help developing countries to overcome difficulties."	I_S0
"China's one belt, one road, helps many African developing countries build China's infrastructure and boost their economic development."	I_S0
"Therefore, the economy of developing countries can recover."	I_S0
"Meanwhile, Health care has the strongest correlation with economic growth, because if a country does not have enough economic strength, it cannot build enough medical facilities."	I_S0
"At that time, when Ebola virus spread in Africa, many developed countries sent medical teams to these developing countries, and they developed drugs to treat the disease in time."	I_S0
"After the virus passed, a lot of money was invested to help these countries build hospitals and buy medical facilities."	I_S0
"In addition，The development of education is also very important."	I_S0
"The cultivation of talents is the most important."	I_S0
"Only with more elites can the development of the country be more rapid in the future."	I_S0

"In the contemporary society, the public has attached a increasing concern to the unpaid service in the community."	S_T1
"Some individuals hold the view that  the high school should provide some social services for free."	B_S0
"From my perspective, this activity could bring more benifits to students than drawbacks."	I_S0
"It is obvious that unpaid community service is positive for students' mental health."	I_S0
"For instance, working for a charity is able to allow students understand that there are numerous people living in the porverty, and give children a chance to aid them."	I_S0
"From this event, schools could help students to keep an accommodating habit."	I_S0
"Additionally, working for a charity would improve the happiness of students, because meeting others' demands is likely to make children feel that they are useful, and then the students may feel satisfied."	I_S0
"Moreover, the free social service is able to be benificial to the physical health of children."	I_S0
"For example, schools could organise a unpaid sports event, hence every students can enjoy the activity and need not to worry about the fee."	I_S0
"Therefore, ev"	E_S0

"What are the reasons for this situation?"	E_T1
"From my point of view,there are two types of students will choose to do so."	B_S0
"Ones are weary of studying or often get bad grades,ones are born in a poor family and have no alternative but to discontinue thire lessons."	I_S0
"Hu Yan,one of my classmates,who usually studied unintentionally but liked children,leaving our middle school to a kindergarten and wanted to be a kindergarten teacher when we are in Grade 8."	I_S0
"Eventually,she passed the interview and had a good salary."	I_S0
"Now,Hu is doing what she likes,howbeit,I am sympathize with that those useful and interesting knowledge will away from her forever."	I_S0
"Due to her experience,more and more students tried for social works."	I_S0
"They thought that just learning at school is useless for the reason that they couldn't taste the joy of learing."	I_S0
"However,from where I stand,I hold the opinion that students are supposed to finish their studies before job-hunting,which can help them accumulate knowledges and expriences."	I_S0
"As the proverb goes,'Rome is not built in one day.'"	I_S0
"Only when you can endure the loneliness,believe in yourself and hold on to the end can we achieve the real success."	I_S0

"It is quiet common in  many countries that people have attrached importance to learning foreign languages."	S_T1
"As a result,there are conflicting views that whether tarveling or working aboard can be the only reason to conplete the target."	B_S0
"As far as I am concerned,there are also other benefits for language learning."	I_S0
"It is true that to communicate with foreigners fluently does play some parts in leading people to become a linguist."	I_S0
"But I believe that it is far from engouh to say that it is the only cause."	I_S0
"For thos who totally support this view,maybe they have oversimplyfied the situation."	I_S0
"The fact is that many people learn,however, a second language due to their work."	I_S0
"As is kown to all,companies reccently always have an international cooperation due to the globalization."	I_S0
"Consequently,it is essential for thos workers to learn another language."	I_S0
"Studying another language,on the other hand,can also be beneficial for shaping people's characteristic."	I_S0
"It is hard job to speak a foreign language as great as local does which would resulting in the fact that you need to be brave enghou that you can dare to have a talk with the foreigners."	I_S0
"So it can develop the courage of people."	I_S0
"Additionaly,it also make it possible for a  lazy person to become a great slef-controled one since only has a man practiced the second language many engouh,he will gain the ability to speak it as fluent as his mother language."	I_S0
"In conclusion,not only does learing a second language have positive impact on the job promotion,but it can also benefit our personality."	I_S0
"From my own perspective,travling or working aboard cannot be the reason of learing foreign language alone."	E_S0
 
"Increasing numbers of people study abroad or travel overseas."	S_T0
"During the time that they live in a foreign country, they are more likely to speak local language which is a foreign language,some social problems and pratical problems might be raised by that."	B_S0
"On one hand,the practical problems is variety."	I_S0
"For example, one cannot speak the foreign language fluently and accurately."	I_S0
"It is obviously that if a person who is illiterate, how hard his life would be."	I_S0
"He cannot even recognize the way home."	I_S0
"Moreover, lack of proper skiills of the local language,it might be difficult to find a job and to discribe clearly the situation of your body when you are in the hospital,without the resource of money and a healthy, let alone to live for a period of time."	I_S0
"On the other hand,it is fairly likely that a person has no social life when living in a foreign country,where a different language is spoken."	I_S0
"Since language is the primary means of communication which could also express your feelings and emotions,without saying that out one can hardly be understood and thus has difficulty in socializing."	I_S0

"Nowadays, some people believes that teachers are playing a more inportant role than parents for the school children on their intelligence and social development."	S_I0

"Although children spend a long time with teachers, they still have more time to spend with their parents."	I_S0
"It is a good time for them to learn the social skills and wisdom from the parents."	E_S0
"Then, when kids stay in school even their teachers are really responsible, it is difficult for teachers that to concern every of the children."	S_M0
"Unluckily, those kids who are not earned the concern must gain the intelligence and social skill from their parents."	B_S1
"If not, it will destory the kids."	E_S1
"However, despite there are some opinions which support the parents, that doesn't mean it is useless for teachers' help."	S_M0

"For example, if two kids were fighting, most parents' first idea will be protect their own child, but this will misguade the kids and give them wrong thing."	I_S0
"When they bring this to the society that would hurt them."	I_S0
"On the contrary, by contrast, teachers can teach the kids better intelligence to solve the problems like this."	E_S0
"Overall, the education of the intelligence and social development for school children, teachers and parents has its own advantages and disadvantages."	B_C1

"In the contemporary world, there is an increasingly popular trend that consumers tend to purchase a variety of household products."	S_T1
"Some see this trend as a negative development,holding the view that it unnecessarily wastes a lot of money."	B_S0
"However, in my opinion, it is a positive development since it creates great efficiency and convenience to the ordinary course of life."	I_S0
"Those, who perceive the popular trend of housewares purchases as negative, may maintain that it is unduly wasteful to purchase many household goods such as television, microwave and oven, since the daily life may not need that much help or entertainment from those goods."	I_S0
"For example, instead of watching TV after the dinner, individuals could choose to take a walk, which is a more relaxing and healthier lifestyle."	I_S0
"Besides, meals can still be cooked deliciously and properly in a single pan without the help from microwave and oven, since there may still exist some side effects of using newly designed products, for example excessive microwave may result in serious brain damage."	I_S0
"Therefore, it can be advocated to those consumers that they should adopt and return to a much simpler and more natural lifestyle as years before."	I_S0
"Nevertheless, I would be in favor of the trend of purchasing more housewares for maximum efficiency and convenience to our life."	I_S0
"Firstly, the current pace of life has been accelerated so greatly that individuals should allocate the time very effectively to manage everything appropriately."	I_S0
"This suggests that people should not waste too much time on some housework like cooking or doing laundries if the household goods could help us to accomplish them."	I_S0
"Besides, with the significant development of technology, consumers can enjoy the higher standard of living for the reason that many household products containing television, videoplayer and washing machines could bring huge amounts of convenience to life."	I_S0
"No matter in busy weekdays or casual weekends, people can have much more freedom to decide what they can do easily with the help of a variety of household goods."	I_S0
"For example, TV consumers could enjoy a great night in watching a nice movie with the family , and also oven consumers could make a decilicious roasted beef feast for a party with their close friends."	I_S0
"Therefore, there is no reason to resist the temptation of leading a more efficient and convenient life thanks to the advert of these household goods."	I_S0
"In conclusion, even though there is a choice to live simply and naturally without those household products, the benefits of efficiency and convenience to the ordinary course of life should not be ignored since consumers have the right to enjoy a higher level of living standards and satisfaction in this contemporary world."	I_S0
"Therefore, in my opinion, it is definitely a positive development in the popular trend of housewares since it offers us much greater freedom to choose a life to live and enjoy more utility than ever before."	E_S0
 
"In this article, I will explain why I think it is a good idea for high school students to do voluntary community service."	B_I0
"The main reason I believe this is that it provides secondary school students with a wider range of knowledge, and experience of their community and society in general."	I_I0
"Some types of community service include working with the sick or disabled to give students the opportunity to help those less fortunate."	I_I0
"Other types of community service give students the opportunity to work with children or participate in projects that improve the community."	E_I0
"All these broaden students' horizons and show them their position in the society."	S_T1
"Another major advantage of providing community service to secondary school students is that some work experience can be provided to them."	S_M1
"This is particularly true in some areas, like health care, but I think community service often provides people with a work ethic that will obviously help them throughout their lives."	B_S1
"The fact that the work is unpaid may encourage some students to continue doing community service, even if it is not a required part of their secondary school curriculum."	E_S1
"In addition, many community services lack volunteers, so in this way middle school students are used to provide enough people to fill the gap."	S_M1
"The supply of students is likely to continue as older students leave and new ones enter, so the provision of these community services is almost guaranteed."	S_S2
"In a word, I think it is a good idea to let middle school students do community service."	S_C2
 
"With the advancement in technology, many electronic devices and internet games changed our lives."	B_I0
"Near 90 percent of the children have a cellphone with them."	I_I0
"Some people think that because of these electronic devices and internet games, children today are harder to educate than in the past."	E_I0
"From my own perspective, children are not harder to educate than children in the past."	S_T0
"First, the advance in technology can provide children with faster information reaching tool."	S_M0
"This can help children to find their study resource more quickly than in the past."	B_S0
"Imagine this, if a child in the past need to learn some new subject, he/she had to look for some book in the library and there may be some book was not exist."	I_S0
"However, nowadays, there is a more varied way to get to knowledge."	I_S0
"For example, online courses and electronic books."	I_S0
"Students can easily find those things if they type them on the browser."	I_S0
"And in recent years, we have smartphones which we could carry to everywhere."	I_S0
"That's means we can acquire knowledge everywhere and every time."	E_S0
"another reason can be seen by everyone is that there are some internet games that border people's normal duty."	S_M0
"Nevertheless, that's not true, researchers found out that human's brain ability can be improved if they play online games for adequate hours."	B_S0
"That's means if children are not playing games for so long that their eyes maybe hurt, this activity may be a good way to relax and develop their brain."	I_S0
"Also, online games can improve social ability because they have to communicate with other's and even make more friend."	E_S0
"Admittedly, mobile phones and online games take up a lot of time in today's society."	S_M0
"Some children can not stop using mobile phones, and some children play online games for one night."	B_S0
"These things may take up their time that should be taken on the study."	I_S0
"However, I think parents should guide their children on how to make a daily routine more reasonable."	I_S0
"In this way, their children could have a good habit on their daily schedule."	I_S0
"Like for what time they go to study, for what time they go to play games, and for what time they go to the bed."	I_S0
"I think this is very essential in educating children."	E_S0
"All in all, I think educating children today is not difficult than educate them in the past because of the advance in technology serves a  good way to reach the study resource, and online games can relax and develop their brain."	B_C1
"Also, the problem of wasting time can be fixed if their parents guide them properly."	E_C1
 
"Nowadays,some parents give their children prize when they get high mark in school."	S_I0
"I think this is not really benifit to kids' life."	B_T1
"Here's my opinion."	E_T1
"Firstly, children may be more dependent when they grow up."	S_M2
"Since every time they get money from their parents, they may think their parents are rich enough to pay for their score."	B_S0
"they will turn to their parents for money when they grow up, which means they will be not independent."	I_S0
"Take a friend who is already the age to find a job for exemple."	I_S0
"He has earned award for his getting good grades."	I_S0
"What is he doing now?"	I_S0
"Only sitting in the sofa, begs money from his parents."	I_S0
"He can not just works himself to earn income."	I_S0
"Because in his opinion, even if he  has no job, his parents do have ability keep him living wonderful life."	E_S0
"This is of course not the only disadvantage."	B_C0
"Giving kids money for their grades can also make them cocentrate more on fame and money than spirit."	I_C0
"Children given so much money may fall in love with the feel of being award."	E_C0
"When they become adults, all they want is to reperform this feel."	B_S0
"It is not uncommon for us to heard that someone earn quantities of profit due to others pain."	I_S0
"This is what is going to be."	I_S0
"For instance, a townmate of my friend, who is selling food."	E_S0
"He, of course getting pay in his child"	O
 
"The flow chart illustrates the working process of a geothermal power plant where is used to generate electricity by using geothermal genrgy, which is consisted of five sections."	O
"At the beginnning of the process, the cold water pumped down into the injection well throgh a 4.5km-long tube."	S_M1
"After that, the water will pass through a geothermal zone."	B_S1
"It is made up by many hot rocks to produce hot water, which is followed by the next step that the hot water will pumped up into a condenser through another tube."	E_S1
"Subsequently, these hot water is condensed into steam in the condenser."	S_M1
"Once being done, the turbine gain the power from steam, which can also produce energy for generator to generate electricity."	B_S1
"Finally, the electricity will be transfered into households or industries for people to use."	E_S1
"Overall, this power plant using natural resouces to produce electricity, which is divided into five parts, and are all essential in the generation of electricity."	S_C2
 
"The article discussed several problems scientists are facing if they are going to send human to Mars, but the professor in the listening stated that all of these problems can be solved."	S_T1
"Firstly, the passage claimed that a trip to Mars is impossible because the limited amount of space on the spacecraft does not allow astronauts to bring much supplies, but a trip between the Earth and Mars takes two years, which means."	S_M0
"Without the basic supplies, the astronauts cannot survive for two years."	B_S0
"However, the woman in the listening said this problem can be solved by a kind of technology."	I_S0
"By using this technology, astronauts can grow foods in water, which requires a smaller space."	I_S0
"This technology can solve the problem whereby they have no supplies."	I_S0
"In addition, the water used for grow vegetable can be recycled and drank by people."	E_S0
"Moreover, the paragraph mentioned that the environment with zero gravity would decrease astronauts' muscle mass and lower the bone density, and the effect would be very serious after two years."	S_M0
"Nevertheless, the professor in the lecture stated that astronauts can solve this problem by taking regular exercises and having minerals and vetamins."	B_S1
"Moreover, astronauts have been trained in the environment of zero-gravity on Earth for years and the situation does not occur which has proved that this problem can be solved."	E_S1
"Lastly, the article mentioned said that astronauts would be exposed to harmful space radiation emiited by the Sun."	S_M0
"More seriously, it is unrealistic to build a shield that protect the spaceship because it is too heavy."	B_S0
"However, the professor pointed out that the Sun only emit the harmful particle occasionally."	I_S0
"As a result, the astronauts just need a monitor device and a portable shelter."	I_S0
"When the monitor device detects radiation, the astronauts can just hide into the shelter until the radiation ceases."	E_S0
"In this article, the article mainly discussed the problems scientists are facing if they want to send people to Mars."	B_C1
"Nevertheless, the professor reject all of the points by pointing out possible solutions."	E_C1
 
"With globalisation,the connections between different countris have become closer."	S_T1
"An incresing number of people choose to learn a second language,while their purposes are unlike."	B_S0
"SOME of them think learning a foreign language is just for travelling and working."	I_S0
"Oppotents do not agree with the absolute opinion."	I_S0
"It is clear that there are thousands of attractions which are worthy ro visit and oppotunities to get promotion in foerign countries."	I_S0
"It is necessary for one travellers or jobhunters to learn other language in order to assist them to understand the local culture and custome or help them to communicate with colleagues,which enable workers to improve their working efficiency."	I_S0
"However , it is reluctant to get the result which definiting the goal of becoming a bilinguals is due to travel and work."	I_S0
"Sometimes ,people learn other languages is owing to visit their famlily in abroud ,which can strenghen the bonding between family members."	I_S0
"On the other hand,some people study foreign languages but they do not go abroad."	I_S0
"Without doubt ,the language is the symbol of sprecific peoples and cultures."	I_S0
"It is an effective method for people to study foreign language to distinguish the differences betweem two cultures in order to eliminate the discrimination."	I_S0
"In addition,some adults learn foreign languages because they want to become a bilingual teacher to teach students knowledge of foreign countries,which cultivate the special sense of blending with 
inthernational friends in childrens minds."	I_S0
"It is meaningful and valuable to reinforce the cooperation around the world."	I_S0
"From my perspective ,many reasons make the thought of people to learn languages."	I_S0
"Beyond all question,working and travelling are the main objectives,while a large number of people study languages for widening horizon and achieve their dreams."	I_S0
"I hope more people to become a bilinguals,which can increase the speed of globalisation."	E_S0
 
"It is claimed by many people that the government funding should be placed more on infrastructures like hospitals ,schools and libraries instead of those artistic projects like art galleries or music concerts."	S_T1
"Personally, I disagree with it."	B_S0
"Admittedly, infrastuctures indeed are essntial for the urban development."	I_S0
"For instance, hospitals ensure citizens' healthcare, schools provides children with the opportunity to get knowledge, and libraries are the place where every citizen can enrich and recharge themselves."	I_S0
"In this way, the governments should provide enough number of those facilities with high quality."	I_S0
"However, it does not mean that the importance of art and humanities should be neglected."	I_S0
"First of all, I believe no one can livce without art for the reason that it makes people's life much more colorful."	I_S0
"For example, when people are under huge pressure due to their demanding and endless works, a piece of melody can always relax and cheer them up at that time; or during the free time, art is also a frequent topic being mentioned among friends' conversations, such as a new popular song or certain excellent artwork."	I_S0
"In this way, if there are not enough amount of art, citizens' life will be depressed and dull."	I_S0
"Another reason for  supporting art development is that it is important fora large group of artists life and future."	I_S0
"It is because that there are so many people who are born with amazing art talents or endless enthusiasm  on art, so it will be  a huge loss not only to themselves but also to the society as a whole if they cannot continue their art career  due to lack of cultivation, supports and investment from the society."	I_S0
"To conclude, though it is undeniable that citizens should have enough public facilities, the art and humanities is also an area  that worth the same level of  funding from the governments."	E_S0

"In this qualifications, just have undergraduate diploma and bachelor's degree that females more than males, also women have a little skilled vocational diploma."	I_S0
"The majority of females have secondary education qualifications and the higher education qualifications have a part but under the males had proportion."	E_S0
"So according to the chart ,we can see the female mainly occupy the econdary education qualifications ,but the male have take up the low and higher education qualifications ."	S_M2
"Hence the goverment of Australia should mainly develop the male of education in  skilled vocational diploma and pay attention to female's education of postgraduate diploma and master's degree ,which will equality the proportion of men and women who held them in future."	S_S2
 
"I don't think it is not a good idea that parents offer their school-age childern money for each high grade (mark) they get in school."	B_T1
"There are some reasons as follows:
First of all, from my perspective, there are lots of methods for parents to encourage their childern to study, however, if money get involved in it, the meaning of encouragement will be changed."	I_T1
"Childern might regard getting good grades as a way to get money so that education will no more be what it should be."	E_T1
"Secondly, childern perhaps don't have such ability to manage their money."	S_M2
"As for them, the money offerde by parents to"	O
 
"Despite many efforts are made in agriculture recently,the plights of the starving people all around world,especially African countries,are being constantly reported in news."	S_T1
"There are numerous causes of the consequence,one of the main reason is the environmental damage."	B_S0
"People waste the limited sources extensively,such as cut down a large quantities of trees,which will lead to global warming."	I_S0
"As a result,seasons of bad harvests could be easily taken place."	I_S0
"Furthermore,uncontrolled population growth gives rise to more human beings to be fed."	I_S0
"Hence,the advances made in agriculture is too tiny to afford the large demands."	I_S0
"Besides,the third factor is foodwastage because it is estimated that one third of food produced is never consumed,which represents a missed opportunity to improve global food security in a world where one in eight is hungry."	I_S0
"In order to solve this problem thoroughly,internationalbodies could seek to bypass the official structures of countries with political problems that hinder the growth of sufficient food."	I_S0
"They could do this by offering food,training and resouces to people areas of sympathetic neighboring countries,close to the relevant national borders."	I_S0
"In conclusion,in view of the fact that millions and millions of people who suffer from the hungry problems,effectuve actions should be taken in innovating science and technology."	I_S0
"Otherwise, the global food problem is likely coming sooner than is expected."	E_S0
 
"The diagrams describe the living circus of a kind of large fish which named the salmon."	B_I0
"Overall, there are three stages of salmon: the fry, which length is about 3 to 8 centimeters, the smolt and the adult salmon, which length is about 12 to 15 centimenters and 70 to 76 centimeters respectively."	E_I0
"At the begining, the salon eggs is living in the upper river about 5 to 6 months, and lying with reeds and small tones."	S_M2
"Then, the eggs grow up as the fry, living deeper than before in lower river which is fast flowing about 4 years, and turn to the smolt."	B_S0
"In addtion, the smlon continues to live deeper in the opean sea, and stay the longest years of 5 years."	I_S0
"Finally, the adult salmon swims back to where it borned."	E_S0
"After all, we could see that the salmon eggs grow up as the adult salmon has suffered about nine years, and back to upper water."	S_S2
 
"in the comtemporory society, after graduation from high school, certain students choose to take a gap year before going to universities, which leads a fierce discussion."	S_I0
"in my opinion, the advantage out weigh disadvantage."	S_T1
"I will elaborate my views as follows."	B_S0
"stidents tend to be very exhausted after studying for so many years, so they need a rest."	I_S0
"and during the gap year, they are able to relax without thinking about troubles."	I_S0
"as for me, when I was 18, I went for holiday and really had a great fun that time."	I_S0
"I felt happy and energetic, even now, I can still pick up the freat memory."	I_S0
"that is the reason why I think we can relax to make us happy during the gap year."	I_S0
"what's more, it can also leave us a new world."	I_S0
"in addition, we can do some meaningful acticities as well,like being volunteers."	I_S0
"today, there are many developing and even undeveloped countries, we can try our best to help them."	I_S0
"it can also make our life meaningful and colorful."	I_S0
"my friend Alice is a good example."	I_S0
"she went to Thailand to be a volunteer during the gap year."	I_S0
"to be more specfic, she was a teacher there."	I_S0
"evertday, she taught the children English and played games with them, she said she was really happy and had a sence of achievement."	I_S0

"thus it  is a great way."	E_S0
 
"It has increasingly been observed that people are choosing to be self-employed rather than signing on with a company or organization as employees."	B_T0
"There are various factors that contribute to this phenomenon,and while it may seem satisfying to work for oneself at first glance,doing so may also come with its own drawbacks."	E_T0
"As for the reasons that people are choosing to quit working for an employer,it is likely due to various economic and technological factors."	S_M1
"For instance,despite ever-increasing profits,company benefits and pay grades have remained largely unchanged for the past few decades."	B_S0
"Similarly,treatment of workers in many fields has declined as markets have globalized."	I_S0
"A particularly notable example of this is the programming industry,wherein workers are pushed to work 100 hours a week for months at a time."	I_S0
"Many people have found that working at home is simply more convenient and allows them to be more productive thanks to the Internet."	I_S0
"Rather than having to travel to have meetings,self-employed workers can have video conferences with their clients and keep in constant communication from the comfort of their home."	E_S0
"The convenience of working from home comes at a price,though."	S_M1
"Without the networking that takes place at an office,professionals who wish to advance their careers,or rely on connections to perform their duties must find new wavs to meet new people and clients."	B_S0
"Also,working for oneself means that one does not have the protections that companies can offer,such as insurance and legal representation."	I_S0
"This can prove very problematic for people working in fields with high liability."	I_S0
"Furthermore,for the recently self-employed,finding work can be difficult without an established reputation,as clients are wary of wasting time and money on freelancers that may underperform."	E_S0
"To conclude,the phenomenon of greater numbers of people becoming self-employed is likeiy due to stagnant economic incentives and the henefits that have been conferred on work life thanks to the Internet."	B_C1
"However,those who wish to be their own bosses must be willing to accept the limitations that come with being a company of one person.,including fewer resources and difficulty in securing clients."	E_C1

"Many billboard,discounted advertisemnets in particular,can boost the consumers desire of shopping."	I_S0
"For exampe,in my country,a part of thing of the superarket will discount at some weekends or festivals,and will give enormous notices."	I_S0
"Many consumers can buy a lot of things on that day, which their price is much cheaper than usual day."	I_S0
"In spite of the fact that those products are useless to consumer,this behavior may makes consumers feel a sense of satisfaction."	I_S0
"However,for the poor, the function of advertisement is to compare."	I_S0
"For instance,the poor could compare the things on the advertisements."	I_S0
"Then they tend to pick out necessary things,which they may not afford other things ."	I_S0
"The products that are picked up by the poor usually are high sale,because they might be as good as advertised."	I_S0
"In conclusion,the poor are, after all,only a minority,so many consumers are still attracted to advertisements."	E_S0

"The largest percentage is in central Asia,approximately 90
% of the total water was used in this area."	I_S0
"In south America,the proportion of water for domestic use is the largest (about 90%)."	I_S0
"However,in some other areas such as Africa,central Asia,southeast Asia,this part is the smallest,less than 10 per cent."	I_S0
"overall,four of the regions,south America,Africa,central Asia,southeast Asia,use most of their water for agricultural use and in north America and Europe,water was mainly used for industry."	I_S0
"The percentage of water used for domestic field are not too large among these six areas."	E_S0
 
"I agree that people in senior management position are always have higher salaries."	S_T0
"As we all know,the labour force in our market is limited,so it has to be some difference between manual workers and brain workers."	B_S0
"Managers in a company,as brain workers,need to consider about all things that could happen in the future and also distribute assignments to other staffs."	I_S0
"On the contrary,other workers in the company only have to pay their attention to those concrete things,so their labour force are more cheaper than those  managements."	I_S0
"And if you want to be a brian worker,a management,you should pay more sweat."	I_S0
"When talking to this topic,some memories crowded into my mind."	I_S0
"I once read a case in my book."	I_S0
"Sam and Tom are roommates in the university but very different in many aspacts."	I_S0

"According to my experience, I am in favor of the former for they create much more fun in the company with  explanations and exapmles given as below."	S_T1
"Firstly, different types of tasks bring more challenges to a ordinary employee, which promises more a potential change of their current situation."	S_M1
"In order to solve problems that came along with this newly assigned job, people can be more motivated to find answers using all kinds of resources, and be more creative in thinking out of the box."	B_S1
"This not only encouraged their self development but also bring out the best from them rather than ordinsry life setting, given them a new pespective to the whole issue and a promised promotion if they can handle these tasks sucessfully."	E_S1
"Secondly, different tasks at work give people a break from the scheduled meetings and  piled documents, which allow them to change their settings in mind and  brings back the connection with the realms of knowledge that they have learned before."	S_M1

"It is a phenomenon commonly recognized that some people think it was necessary to spend a great deal of money on new railway lines, which used to facilitate the construction of high-speed trains between cities."	S_I0
"However, some may disagree with this phenomenon by arguing that the money should be spent on improving existing public transport, and I think the opinion is unreasonable to some extent."	S_T0
"Spending money on new railway lines to allow high-speed trains to run between cities is a good idea."	S_M1
"With the progress of science and technology, there are many ways for us to choose when people will decide to travel in the holiday, like plane, train, and car are both good choices."	B_S1
"If more and more high-speed railways emerge, people will have a cheaper but less time-consuming option than air travel, which will increase people's desire to travel and thus promote social and economic development."	E_S1
"And the idea of using that money to improve existing public transportation, I think, is not very comprehensive."	S_M1
"Because the existing level of public transport is already relatively high, no useful means of travel can be added anyway."	B_S0
"As for the existing roads, although they have been built even, some places are still not accessible by driving cars in a short time."	I_S0
"This is especially true for trains, which, no matter how much we improve them, cannot be as fast as high-speed trains."	E_S0
"To sum up, I take the view that it is necessary to spend a lot of money to build new railway lines, because when a country develops, the length of the railway determines the development potential of the country to some extent."	S_C2
"By doing so, the new railway lines can promote social and economic development and also make it easier for people to travel."	S_S2

"I will explain the causes of the phenomenom as follow."	B_S0
"First of all, they thought the rules of school banned them do what they liked."	I_S0
"In other words, they were reluctant to do things the school was against, which restricted freedom of them."	I_S0
"Second, they thought they are not interested in the subjects of choice by themselves."	I_S0

"This causes that they have negative thougths about studying."	I_S0
"Finally, they did not have good relationship with classmates."	I_S0
"Because several roomates in the accommendation came from different places and have diversified habbits."	I_S0

"Then, he and I oragnised some activities for students and teached me many things how oragnise and prepare the activities."	I_S0
"Finally, he is one of best friends."	I_S0
"Next, they can have the ability to communicate with tutors and lecturers for pushing themselves forward correct direction."	I_S0

"After 3-8 days,it becomes a cocoon."	I_S0
"It finally ends up its growth after 16 days as a moth."	I_S0
"The next proccess is the production of silk cloth."	I_S0
"First of all,we need to select some excellent moths as materials and put into the water for heating until it boiled."	I_S0
"Here we can see that the cocoon can be unwound to threads which the length can reach to 300-900m."	I_S0
"Then we are supposed to twist it and get dyed in the box."	I_S0

"Nonetheless, some people may reckon that it may have a negative influence towards them,and the other may hold a view that it may make the children heading towards their dreams easily."	E_I0
"From my point of view,the parents should spare no effort to support their children."	S_T1
"I deem that if the children were wise and splendid, their way of chasing the high grades and the sprcific dreams will cost much money,becouse they would build up a higher achievement than anothers."	S_M1
"Thus,to support them,maybe,is no just for the family itself,but also for the whole society."	B_S0
"For the instance, the children may full of talence of mathmatics,he might have the opportunity to become the professor who will benefit the whole human society."	I_S0

"In the reading and the listening oart, the author and the speaker have an disagreement over whether the provided ways to avoid birds from get injured is effective or not, and here are what they say."	S_T1
"Firstly, in the article, the wtitter says that we could use on-way glass, which means birds from outside of the buldings will not be able to see through it, and thus will not try to fly through it."	S_M0
"While in the lecture, the professor says that this will not work, because it will still reflect lights, and since birds cannot differentiate the actual objects and the reflected objects, they might think these reflected sky and trees as the real one, and then they will fly to it."	S_S2
"Secondly, in the writting part, the author suggests that people can draw colorful stripes on the glass, and people can still see through these stripes, while birds can avoid flying through it."	S_M0
"However, the instructor has a different opinion."	B_S1
"He says that birds might just preceive these spaces between stripes as holes, and then they will try to fly through it, and if people want to avoid this from happening, the space that are not being clolred is quite small, which makes the room inside so dark."	E_S1
"Thirdly, in the paragraph, the writter thinks that people can add magnetic field tp guide the birds, to let them fly away from the buildings."	S_M0
"But the professor from the lecture says that it is not a possible way to do so."	B_S1
"Because birds only use magentic field when they are required to fly through a long distance, like from a cold place to a warm place, but if they just travel for a distance like from one side of the city to another side, they will probably not use the magentic field to guide their way."	E_S1
 
"During recent decades,it has been a widespread trend that the amount of tv channels are increasing dramatically."	S_I0
"Someone believed that there are some advantages,on the other hand,some people hold that massive tv channels only gives rise to lower quality."	S_T1
"As far as I am concerned,the benefits outweigh the drawbacks."	B_S0
"Evidently,growth of the number of tv stations brings about a host of choices in our daily life."	I_S0
"In the past,people could just watch black and white tv with several channels."	I_S0
"There were only several serial dramas and news reports which was extremely tedious."	I_S0
"Compared with decades ago,we have numerous tv programs at present,for instance,reality shows,documentary channels,which spice up our life."	I_S0

"Followed by 4-6 weeks, they make silk threads which can wrap them up still totally bacome cocoons."	I_S0
"before breaking it down to be a moth, these cocoons are selected and added to water for the production of silk cloth."	I_S0
"Subsequently, unwind these cocoons which length are 300 to 900 meters thread."	I_S0
"In the next step, twist them to bunches and then put them to cylinder for dying."	I_S0

"There has always been a heated controversy over whether the progresses of economic is the most important goal or other progresses also remain the same importance for a country, I personally think other types of progress are also inneed."	S_T1
"Economic development is very important, it could influence nearly every thing in a country."	S_M1
"For example, if a country has a high economical development, people who lives in that country will have a higher standard of living than the people who lives in a poor country."	B_S0
"At the same time, economic is the base for all the other types of progress such as medical, educational or even art."	I_S0
"Without high economic progress, professors will have no money to research people even may not have enough food to eat if the country is not an agricultural counry."	E_S0
"On the other hand, other types of progress are also important."	S_M1
"If a country only develop in economic but not art, people will feel sick in the mental level, which might cause the increase of crime rate."	B_S0
"Economic progress is a seed, other progresses are the fruits."	I_S0
"While the economic is developing, technology can also been developed at the same time."	I_S0
"Technology is the primary productive force of the country, without developing  technology, the development of the country is impossible for example produce drugs need develop new technology and communication need it too, these are also important."	E_S0

"As is vividly revealed in the graph, the quantities of goods transported in the UK  between 1974 and 2002 has changed a lot."	B_I0
"Means of goods transportion is divided into four forms: road, water,rail and pipeline."	E_I0
"It is evident that the tendency of transportion weights is rising among these methods except railway transportion."	S_M2
"Through these years, railway transportion has declined from time to time."	B_S0
"While it rise up to the original level with 1974 at last."	I_S0
"And the road transportion owns the highest level  in contrast with pipeline, which has the lowest million tones."	E_S0
"From the analyse above, we can conclude that with the advancement of technology, transportion of different methods would own more capacity to transport goods, and the road would play a more important role in transportion."	S_S2

"In my opinion, I argue that it is positive in some aspects,but also has some negative influences."	I_S0
"Changing careers is really benificial for some people and society."	I_S0
"Because they can get more expereice in this way, which can bring a lot of benifits to themselves and can make job markets more competetive."	I_S0
"For examples, if a large number of people who have worked for several years in companies go to the other better companies, they will be more abstractive than other people."	I_S0
"Because  they already had job experience so that they can adapt the new working curriculums more quickly and finish jobs better."	I_S0
"It can make them more professional in job markets."	I_S0
"By contrast, changing careers can also bring a series of negative impacts."	I_S0
"Because it can cause job markets unstable."	I_S0
"For examples , there are some people who are not satisfied with their salaries and working feelings, so they decide to change another jobs which are suitable for them."	I_S0
"If any difficulties or other accidents come out, they always want to change jobs, which is harmful to society."	I_S0

"Fired Chicken, humburger and chips, these fast food are convinient for people who do not want to cook, but in the meanwhile, the number of people who are suffering from health problem which causing by eating too much fast food is increasing."	B_I0
"Intend to solve this problem, an idea of the goverment to impose a higher tax on fast food appeared, however, I think that is unnecessary."	E_I0
"First of all, impose the higher tax will cause the rise of the price of fast food, which will make the restraunt lose a lot of costumer."	S_M1
"That may put a lot pressure on their shoulder, and may even bring a unhealth competation between restaruants because they all want to make constumer stay by sale their food in a lower price than others."	B_S0
"Secondly, this policy to impose a higher tax on fast food can not actually stop people eat it."	I_S0
"Some people may say that the cheap price of fast food is the reason that people it a lot, but that is not the only reason, people who like the taste would eat it no matter how expensive it is."	E_S0
"So for this situation, I think it is more important to make people aware of the danger of eating too much fast food."	S_M1
"As far as they know how bad the habit is, they will stop doing it by themselves."	S_S2
"Eating habit is a personal thing, in fact, we can not partly ban it from the exterior."	B_C1

"Given is a graph showing how average carbon dioxide emissions per person changed in four countries from 1967 to 2007."	B_I0
"According to the graph, emissions of CO2 per person in Portugal and Italy kept increasing apparently."	I_I0
"The upward tendency of emissions in Portugal began from approximately 1.2 tonnes to 5.2 tonnes, producing the lowest emissions of CO2 among four countries."	I_I0
"And emissions in Italy rose from 4.3 tonnes to 7.5 tonnes ,and exceeded the emssions of Sweden in 1990."	E_I0

"It is widely acknowleged that trasportation is the foundation of a country's development, while there are two main means of  improving it: constructing railways for fast trains between cities and investing on existing public transport."	S_T1
"I think these two ways are both important, you an tell which one is more according to different situations."	S_T0
"For constructing new railway lines fro fast trains between cities, it can definitely enhance the communication between cities, which can make them be more familiar with each other and learn from others."	S_M2
"Apart from that, it would make better use of social resources , for fast long-way trasportation can make distribution easier."	B_S0
"Also it can save us time for working or travelling."	I_S0

"They need to fix the mistakes and find the way to make them correct,It will let them get much stronger feeling,then they may remember the mistakes for a long time and try to never make the same mistakes again."	S_T1
"second,when children make mistakes, they are also learning the experience."	S_M1
"After the mistakes they made,they will know what they can do and what they can't do more clearly."	B_S0
"And when thet have the idea to do the same wrong things,they will still think and remamber the result and the experience,
  Third,by the process the children making mistakes, always is the process they discovering."	I_S0
"They can find many new things and knowledge."	I_S0
"It's the really important part of their life, and it has many benifits fpr then to grow up."	E_S0
"For my own experience, when i was in primary school, i always forget to bring my things back."	S_M1
"At that time i feek very sad and scared."	S_S2

"Nowadays, study becomes more and more important and need students pay more attention to studying, but there still are many students leave schools with negative thoughts, what's reason make these phenomenon happened, this topic will give you some viewpoints and suggestions to improve the situation."	S_T1
"On the one hand, a number of students don't go to school because of the broing school lifestyle, they think the life is not abundent and are tired of doing the same things every time, actually, they can't find any delight in school, and are not interested in any subjests."	B_S0
"On the other hand, kind of student think the subjests are useless and we needn't spent the whole day on study, compare to study, they perfer to somethings which they are infatuated."	I_S0
"In addition, the futher  reason is they want to find a job quickly without study, and think it can earn more money than stay in school."	I_S0
"Occounding to these reason, here are some pretty good suggestions for us."	I_S0
"First of all, we should know, study is the most significant thing when we were children, and it's necessary to stay in school, not only we can get the education, but also we can learn how to live when we stay in the social."	I_S0
"what's more, school also can make some funny activities, and do some interesting things let students fall in love with study."	I_S0
"In fact, nobody want to always study under the pressure."	I_S0
"In summarize, study is very important things for everybody."	I_S0

"The islip town centre now is in the countryside."	S_I0
"There is a main road run through the countryside from west to east."	B_T1
"There is a row of shops on each side of the main road."	I_T1
"In the south of the main road, there is a school."	E_T1
"There is a park in the right of the school."	B_S1
"Between them, it has lots of housing."	E_S1
"In the planned development in the islip town centre, the main way has upgraded to the dual carriageway, which has become a circle."	S_M2
"In the northwest of the circle, it has a bus station, shopping centre, car park and new housing arranging from west to east which have replece the row the shops."	B_S0
"But the south shops still retain."	I_S0
"In the south of them, there is a pedestrians only."	I_S0
"The school can go to the park through dual carriageway."	I_S0
"There are some new housing will also be built in the west of the park."	E_S0
 
"I don't think recycling should be just a government obligation."	B_I0
"All citizens also have the ability to recycle themselves, such as reusing plastic products."	I_I0
"In addition, European governments, especially some northern European countries, have extremely strict legal requirements on environmental protection and high garbage recovery rate."	I_I0
"But it doesn't mean that these wastes are really turned into treasures."	I_I0
"Instead, they are recycled by the government and transported to developing countries for treatment, which goes against the original intention of garbage recycling."	I_I0
"Moreover, in the perspective of globalization, these actions have not improved the environmental protection of the earth, and the transportation of garbage has also increased carbon emissions."	E_I0
"I think it's better to design a bill to reward garbage recycling enterprises, including tax, policy subsidies and other aspects, to put forward a bill to improve the garbage recycling rate."	S_M1
"Let the market recycle the residual value of garbage, the gradual policy of market regulation is more conducive to garbage recycling."	S_S2
"For the common people, on the one hand, we should reduce their burden on garbage collection, on the other hand, we should improve the awareness of environmental protection, which is the key to improve the garbage collection rate in the most basic link."	S_M1
"For example, different garbage bags in Taipei represent different kinds of garbage, with different charges."	B_S0
"The step pricing is more affordable for the public."	I_S0
"In northern Europe, another reason for the high garbage recovery rate is that the cold weather leads to the slow natural degradation of garbage, so people have a strong sense of garbage recovery since ancient times."	E_S0
"To sum up, improving the garbage recovery rate not only needs to be solved from the legal level, but also has the assistance of administrative means and the improvement of national quality, which together affect the garbage recovery efficiency."	S_C2
 
"So in the passage it mainly discussed about the functions of the crest of some dinosaurs species scientists have figured out."	B_I0
"There're three suggestion proposed in the reading section."	I_I0
"However, the point of view hold by the professor in the speech doesn't seems friendly and approval to these suggestion."	E_I0
"The first point made about the use of the crest is smell."	S_M1
"About this hypothesis, actually the prove from the paleonyologist is that virtually they found out that most common feature of the anatomy of skull from the discovery of the dinosaurs which have the crest of bone is that the nasal cavity dinosaur used to breath , is extended to the crest."	B_S0
"However, the professor have made the strong argument about this 'suspections' in the lecture."	I_S0
"He announced that actually the animals who have the great sensitivity of the smell consequently will have the larger and more complicated brain."	I_S0
"Instead, according to the scientific prove, the actual size of the dinosaur brain is just as same size as a walnut, which totally against this suggestion."	E_S0
"The second point is about the crest could regulating the body temperature as the average surface temperature at that time was super high compared to now."	S_M1
"As they believed that those dinosaurs which doesn't adapted to the water are resulting to have this function in order to adapt to the environment."	B_S0
"In contrast, the professor proposed that the crest 's size, compared to the 'enormous'size of the dinosaur, is restrictingly small to provide enough heat transfer for the body temperature's regulation."	I_S0
"Instead, he suggested that the dinosaur somehow using their skins and other organs for the diffusion of the heat."	E_S0
"The third viewpoint announced that the dinosaur used it to make sound for communication, and it provided the example of the lambeosaurs which does have the scientific prove."	B_C0
"But, the professor still against the point because in his perspective, its unreliable to define and receive the result from the unilateral results."	I_C0
"The lambeosaurs , in his view, is just a particular species who is likely to use the crest for communication."	E_C0
 
"The diagrams indicate that the life cycle of the silkworm and the process of producing the silk cloth."	S_I0
"The life cycle is divided into four stages."	S_M1
"Initailly, a moth produces its eggs on the leaves."	B_S0
"After 10 days, the eggs become silkworm larva which is feed with mulberry leaf."	I_S0
"Sequently, the larva generates silk thread to covering themselves in the following 4 to 6 weeks."	I_S0
"Afterwards, the larva is fully covered by silk thread and becomes cocoon over the next 3 to 8 days."	I_S0
"Finally, a moth breaks out of the cocoon during a period of 16 days."	I_S0
"A life cycle of the silkworm is over."	E_S0
"The precess of producing the silk cloth consists several steps."	S_M1
"First of all, the cocoon which is selected is put into the container with water and then is boiled."	B_S0
"Next, the cocoon is ready to be unwinded into threads ranging from 300 to 900 meters in length."	I_S0
"Sequently, the threads are twisted together and weaved to a cloth."	I_S0
"In the end, we dye this cloth and a silk cloth is produced."	E_S0
 
"An increasing number of people hold that it is essential for children to distinct something right or wrong and punishment is quite favorable."	S_I0
"In my opinion, learning to tell wrong from right does not fit children in all ages and punishment does not have much of a role to play in it."	B_T0
"Therefore I do not agree with the entire idea."	E_T0
"To begin with, teaching an infant what is right or wrong is significantly ridiculous."	S_M0
"For the reason that the infants' minds are not mature and they could not understand why the things they do are not true."	B_S0
"Even, they can not realize what they are doing."	I_S0
"So children should be taught in a little older age."	E_S0
"Regardless, punishments of various forms can will almost certainly continue to play a major role in forming a child's conception of the world and the rules by which a society must abide."	S_M0
"To argue that punishment is an effective way of learning rules is fairly straightforward."	S_S2
"It is obviously useful to punish children to help them learn the distinction."	S_M0
"Importantly, the extent of punishment should be controled."	B_S1
"For example, parents and teachers should not use some cruel approaches to teach them."	E_S1
"children can, if provided with enough guidance from a suitably patient adult, come to understand the consequences of their actions from a purely theoretical viewpoint - to put themselves in someone else's shoes - and thus internalise the reason why their actions are wrong rather than viewing it as something they want to do."

"Nowadays many parents would like to have a perfect child."	S_I0
"In order to do that, they may do not whant the child to make any mistakes."	B_T0
"However, there are many people thinks that it is totally wrong and hold the opinion that this kind of action will spoil the child."	E_T0
"From my prespective, I reckon that parents should let children make mistakes and leat them learn from it."	S_T1
"To begin with, it is necessary for children to have the ability of learning from their own mistakes."	S_M0
"The children are going to grow up one day and the parents will leave them."	B_S0
"At that time, no one can protect them."	I_S0
"In the situation, the ability of discovering and concluding form their own mistakes is becoming such an essential thing."	I_S0
"As a good example, my friend, was not a child who did not allow to make mistakes."	I_S0
"In contrast, her parents thought that making mistakes will help her develop the skills of learning."	I_S0
"Consequently, whe she graduated from school, she is able to absorb some experience from her mistakes and the skill is useful for her career."	I_S0
"As the example suggests, the ability of learning from mistakes is indispensible for a person, which can only be praticed from making mistakes."	E_S0
"Secondly, learning from mistakes could leave a deeper memory for the children and let them not make the mistake again."	S_M0
"In contrast, if the parents do not offer the children a chance to make a single mistake, they will forget it quickly."	B_S0
"Next time, the will trapped in the same dilemma."	I_S0
"For example, my classmate is not allowed to make mistakes."	I_S0
"Before he is going to have a mistake his parents would tell him not to do that."	I_S0
"As a consequence, he often forget the mistakes he have made and then do that again."	I_S0
"Had his parents let him to make mistakes, he would not have been the person who often forget the mistake."	E_S0
"There is no denying that parents are not supposed to let their child makes mistakes provides some benifits."	S_M0
"To be more specific, it can HELP THEIR CHILDREN BECOME A PERFECT PERSON which is good for gaining of the confidence."	B_S0
"Nevertheless, the best side can not last long because if the child have a mistake, he or she does not know what to do next because they are not allowed to make mistakes."	I_S0
"As a result, they will become upset and lose confidence, which is a negative effect on the child."	E_S0
"To sum up, parents should let their children to make mistakes cause it is not only optimistic for the ability of learning form their own mistakes but also benificial for the remembering of the mistakes which is capable for the children not to make the mistakes again."	S_C2
 
"Early age is an important period of time for kids to gain basic knowledge of things."	S_T1
"The arguement has been on the edge for a long time whether the punishment is indispensable for children to help them recognize the border between right and wrong, but i tend to regard the punishment as a method that is important instead of necessary."	B_S0
"It can not be argued that appropriate punishment can alert children when they are crossing the line."	I_S0
"On contray of the oppsite sign brought by encouragement, the punishment shows the negative attitude when chirldren do something wrong."	I_S0
"Although it is true to some extent, punishment can bring a bunch of bad effects along as well."	I_S0
"Punishment can do harm to both the physic and mental health of children."	I_S0
"For those unexperienced parents, which means most of the parents, it would be a total disaster when they failed to control how harsh the punishment were meant to be."	I_S0
"Apart from the hurt caused by unpropriate punishment, some kids' anger can be raised strongly by parents, while others may appear to show low self-esteem after the punishment."	I_S0
"In addition to that, children may tend to solve problems with violence, for parents always act as the role model of their kids."	I_S0
"Punishment goes with the negetive atomosphere and forcement for the most of time."	I_S0
"This can be the trigger of teenager commiting crimes."	I_S0
"In my opnion, parents and teachers are suppose to use the punishment as a method of teaching only under the circumstances that they can fully controll and explain to kids."	I_S0
"Hope punishment can be put in use appropriately in the teaching progress."	E_S0

"But as a bad result,he doesn't really relax and his eyes has been badly damaged due to playing games too long."	E_S1
"Of course,everyone don't want to see the bad result that happened to my friend."	S_M0
"But most people are just like my friend,using the modern technology to relax themselves,such as watching films,playing games..."	B_S1
"So,do we need that just drop our computers and cellpones a while,trying to do exercise to relax ourselves?"	E_S1
"As for doing exercise,there many good choices."	S_M0

"From my perspective,I give top priority to the former opinion."	I_S0
"As far as I am concerned,more TV channels have positive impacts on the public's entertainment as well as benifiting social harmony."	I_S0
"To be more specific,a great number of TV channels varying from education to policy make it possible for people to choose what category of TV shows they like."	I_S0
"For that reason, they can learn various knowledge attracting them most, contrubuting to the enrichment of the public's entertainment."	I_S0
"On the top of it,news form all kinds of TV channels stengthen the public's awareness of satisfaction,leading to a hamounious society."	I_S0
"For instance,a TV program about laws allows people to be aware of their safety and convey positve energy to the public, which is essencial to construct  a hamounious society."	I_S0
"Admmitedly,It is the increasing number of TV channels that result in a lot of poor quality TV programs."	I_S0
"Nevertheless, these TV programs accounts for the minority of the whole."	I_S0
"For the reason that they attracts quite few people,which is detrimental to the owners' interest."	I_S0

"Many parents want their children to work or marry early because they don't attache great importance to the education."	I_S0
"Our government should have some policy to promote the basic education to everyone."	I_S0
"For instance, many countries and their governments have the policy of compulsory education."	I_S0
"In China,  the compulsory education of government make every kid can have the free basic education."	I_S0
"The 9 years education make kids have the abilities to
spell and read, which promote the culture of the whole country."	E_S0
"Besides, many people can't afford the expense of the health care and the education."	S_M0
"Some of kids live in the poor family which can not afford the expense of medical treament and school fee."	B_S0
"As far as I am concerned, government should pay for the basic of the vaccine，the primary school to help everyone in the country."	I_S0
"These policy can help the poor a lot, even can save many people's life."	E_S0
"Finally,maybe the government can provide some loans about the education and the health care."	S_M0
"For example, many students in the USA get the loan to study in the university."	B_S1
"It can benefit both the people and the community."	E_S1
"The government don't have the responsibility to any problems in the community, but our government can provide the basic thing or helpful loan in some key areas."	S_C2

"It is universally true that celebrities of modern entertainment industies received popularity without effort that even their opinions and statements often followed by people with limited consideration."	S_I0
"To be specific, their influence on people shows more connection with the issue of age."	B_T1
"Their ideas and concepts are more welcomed by the younger generations rather than the old generation."	E_T1
"Firstly, the young people are in the midth of the pursue of their life goals, thus they are more eager to find sussess icons that can encourage them to face challenges in life."	S_M2
"The wealth and fame celebreties hold often pose a great attaction to them that with countless cases in life we can see young people following the fashion or lifestyle entertainers shows to cameras in order to become popular in the eyes of thier peers."	B_S0
"Though group imitating the speechs and outsfits of their idols, young people dream to develope certain kind of connection to the sucess, and thus formed the cultu
Secondly, the old people are less active or productive in the realm of social communication."	I_S0
"therefore they have less chance to reveive the first-hand information of what the celebrities had made in the other day."	I_S0
"Bedsides, though their rich experience in life, they have already understood the tends and game mechanism in the business world."	I_S0
"Therefore, they generally will not take others opinions or statement true scince they have seen enough lies and plots in  their own life."	I_S0
"Old generation would believe things after examination, thus they are more likely to be doubters rather than receipients."	E_S0
 
"The bar chart give information about the difference between developing and industrialized countries’ participation in education and science in 1980 and 1990."	S_I0
"The average years of schooling in developing countries was just 2.5 years,compared to 8.5 years in industrialized countries."	S_M0
"The data in both countries increased to 3.5 years and 10.5 years in 1990."	B_S1
"It is obvious that there were wide gap in the degree of education between developing and industrialized countries."	E_S1
"Similarly,in term of the number of sciencetists and technicians has the same situation."	S_M0
"In 1990,developing countries only had 10 sciencetists and technicians per 1000 people,while industrialized countries had 40 sciencetists and technicians per 1000 people."	B_S0
"The number gradually rose to 15 and 70 ."	I_S0
"But in 1990,the number of the former rose slightly,while the number of the latter rose sharply,and the gap had widened."	E_S0
"In terms of the spending on research & development has more obvious contrast."	S_M0
"About 50billions$ was spended on research & development by developing countries and 150 billions$ was spended by industrialized countries in 1980."	B_S1
"However much less money was spended by developing countries ,while much more was spended by industrialized countries in 1990,the gap widened to 350 billions$."	E_S1
"Overall,these three charts present that whether education or science levels,there was big gap between these two kinds of countries in 1980 and 1990,and the industrialized countries far outpaced the developing countries."	S_C2
 
"It is an increasingly disturbing problem that people trends to by more cars on their own."	S_I0
"Though somebody may argue that it is more convenient for each people to purchase their own cars, I personally can hardly accept  the damage to environment."	S_T0
"Admittedly, some people insist that owning a car means that they can freely use it when they need."	S_M2
"For instance, when they want to  go somewhere distant, they can easily get prepared without  troubling others."	B_S0
"Although this view is true to some extent, it over-thinking themselves."	I_S0
"As we all know, more cars mens much more pollution."	I_S0
"Not only air pollution, but also noise pollution is influencing everyone incuding the car drivers themselves."	I_S0
"Besides, more cars mean more roads."	I_S0
"And it leads to more chemical materials being used to contribute to original useless roads."	I_S0
"That will also be a plenty of pollution to the environment."	I_S0
"That is why I think the disadvantages of this trend for environment outweigh its advantages for individuals."	E_S0
"What is more, we have replaceable method for people that it is not neccessary for them to by cars."	B_C0
"First, the goverment should pay more attention to transportation planning."	I_C0
"More ways should be provided to be choosed by people."	E_C0

"Nowadays, people pay more and more attention to the recycling of the waste."	B_I0
"There is no doubt that  not enough of the waste from homes is recycled and we can use legal means to increase recycling."	E_I0
"While some people believe that the only way to increase recycling is for governments to make it a legal requirement, I disagree and feel that there are still many other effective ways to solve this problem."	S_T0
"It must be admitted that in addition to preventing people from doing bad things, the law also regulates the role of people doing good things."	S_M1
"If the law requires that all recyclable waste be separated from the trash cans of each family, then there will be much more recycling of waste."	B_S1
"It really works."	E_S1
"The importance of other ways, such as education, advertisement and competition, on the other hand, cannot be ignored."	S_M1
"Firstly, never can we stress the importance of education too much."	B_S0
"The most fundamental way to improve people's quality is to teach children well."	I_S0
"If children are educated to do garbage classification from an early age, then there will be more and more recyclables in the future."	I_S0
"Secondly, advertising occupies a very important part in today's society."	I_S0
"We can see a lot of advertisements everywhere."	I_S0
"So advertising will be a good way to promote people's waste recycling."	I_S0
"Besides, we can promote recycling by holding competitions."	I_S0
"For example, the family do best in garbage sorting in each community can receive the title of environment-friendly star."	E_S0
"In conclusion, it is evident that both legal methods and other methods are effective to increase recycling."	B_C1
"I would therefore argue that the only way to increase recycling is for governments to make a legal requirement."	E_C1
 
"Nowadays we are imposed to a  mutiple-media society , which gives us more opportunities to communicate information with others."	S_T0
"Every ways has its own advantages and disadvantages."	S_T1
"When it comes to books, the information on it are regarded as  more authoritative and credible."	S_M0
"Considering that the popularity and critism of book, the author will devote his ideas , energies and time to publish  book."	B_S0
"For lots of people ,they are willing to learn something from books, no matter is life feeling or acedemic knolwedge."	I_S0
"However, it also has drawbacks."	I_S0
"The update of information on books is not very flexible and fast."	I_S0
"For instance, some scientic books, maybe when it is published to the public, there will be different results."	I_S0
"People can not get latest information."	E_S0
"Television is an useful way to relize more information around the world."	S_M0
"With various  channels on it, including education, technology, sport, fation and so on, people can get every  information they want to know without going abroad."	B_S1
"Of course, during this process, people just rececive the information, they can not express their thoughts."	E_S1
"Another platform to communicate information is radio, it is usually to hear it when people are driving or walking on the street, which is a convienient method for people to know what is going on around them."	S_M0
"For example, the news of transportation, the policy of benefiting people and so on."	B_S1
"While sometimes,  due to it is mainly broadcast, when the amount of information is large, it is difficult for people to catch the announcers to understand it."	E_S1
"In conclusion, i think the television is more effective foe people to access to information."	B_C0
"Firstly, being rich in vivid pictures and vedios, television can express more graphic information to people and make people  remember it deeply."	I_C0
"What is more, the information on TV is very international,  such as international news, sports events, film channels and so on , people can relize more information happened on  abroad, which not only can broden people's views , but also it can make  people experience diffierent culture."	E_C0
 
"These days, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debated among people: whether people will spend less time cooking and preparing food in twenty years than they do today."	B_I0
"From my perspective, people will spend more time on the food preparing and cooking."	E_I0
"My point will be elaborated as follows."	S_T1
"Firstly, the scientific diet need people to select foof carefully."	S_M1
"People will pay more attention on the scientfic living especially the scientific food, so they will spend plenty of time designing a diet and make sure that every food have advantages to human instead of bad influence."	B_S0
"Also the process of cooking need enough time to guarantee that all the bacteria is killed."	I_S0
"On the contrary, todays'people  often just buy the food material and then cook them without the scientific matching and required time to make the food done completely."	I_S0
"consequently, this would have a bad influence on the people today."	I_S0
"For example, with the develop of technology, a research conducted by Harvard un iversity shows that people can use the nutrition detector to monitor the vitamin in the food to create the most healthy food in their home."	I_S0
"So with the fashion to make scientific food, people in twenty years would spend more time one food."	E_S0
"Secondly, people would have more spare time in twenty years, whcih would guarantee that they have enough time spending on the food preparation and cooking."	S_M1
"In the future, people would have more spare time because the advanced technology would take a great amount of works."	B_S0
"With the robots and the computer to control most of the jobs, people do not have the stress to deal with the work."	I_S0
"Consequently, people would develop the cooking as a hobby so they would spend as much as  possible because they enjoy the cooking process and the cooking process would give them happiness and relaxation."	I_S0
"For example,  people in twenty years would come back home at a early time or even they only need to deal with the stuffs at home, receiving some emails."	I_S0
"So they can spend plenty of time preparing the food and cooking to enjoy the relaxing environment."	I_S0
"On the contrary, you can imagine that people today would only buy some quick food or deal with the cooking quickly with so much stress."	E_S0
"All in all, people in twenty years would spend more time on cooking."	S_C2
 
"The diagram below gives information on the way a hydroelectric power station creating electricity."	B_I0
"The river flow constantly into the high-level reservior which is intercepted by a dam."	I_I0
"There are two different water current in the day time and night."	I_I0
"The intake below is open in the day time so that the water could flow to the generator which is operated by the reversible turbines in the power station to generate electricity."	I_I0
"And then be sended to the national grid through the power lines."	E_I0
"At last the current flow into the reservior on the low level."	S_T1
"Conversely,during the night time,the reversible turbines began to pump water into the high-level reservior."	S_M2
"Thus the water could transported from low-level reservior through the intake which is closed at this time and finally inject into the high-level reservior again."	S_S2
"In conclusion,with the continuous injection of water from the river, the hydroelectric power station could generate electricity  through  different direction of water current by reversing the working conditions of the intake and the reversible tuibines."	S_C2
 
"An increasing number of people argue that people decide to work and travel in another country is a main reason for studying a foreign language ,while some people believe that we still have many reasons to study new languages."	S_T1
"I tend to agree with the latter view ."	B_S0
"There is no doubt that the majority of people tend to learn a foreign language such as English is in order to increase their competitive force and create more chance in their life ."	I_S0
"Specifically,many international enterprises especially in the globle top 500 companies require interviewers should  master two foreign languages at least ."	I_S0
"It is a cruel rule for those who are good at different areas without languages."	I_S0
"So, learning a language means that you may have more possibility to enter larger company or work abroad ."	I_S0
"In addition,  it is convenient for people to travel abroad ."	I_S0
"For example,learning a foreign language such as Franch is good for people to deepen understand in culture and history of France."	I_S0
"On the other hand ,another reason is that studying a foreign language is a basic skill to study abroad ."	I_S0
"It is necessary for students who want to study in  foreign university to understand teacher's words and finish homework independendly ."	I_S0
"Also ,many people who are willing to immigrant to foreign country should grasp skill of language ."	I_S0
"So,they have to study specific language and pass exam,and then they can admitted to change nationality ."	I_S0
"Therefore,with our nation interact with other countries frequently,it becomes common to people who learn a foreign language ."	I_S0
"So,I think they are more likely to study languages for different reasons  ."	E_S0
 
"Currenttly, it has become far more normal for children to play computer games."	S_I0
"Some people think it is a waste of time to paly games, while others think it is worthwhile to play a little."	S_T1
"I agree with the latter opinion because of the following reasons."	S_T0
"In the first place, playing computer games can imporve children's ability of creation."	S_M0
"As we all know, when children playing computer games, they need to think about how to find a new way to win."	B_S0
"For some games, they need players to find different ways to reach the final end."	I_S0
"Take my little brother as an example."	I_S0
"He is now playing a computer game half an hour every day, and he would like to discuse with me about his new discoveries on that game."	I_S0
"Thus, playing computer games can improve children's ability of creating."	E_S0
"In the second place, playing computer games are practicing children's lenth of focusing time."	S_M0
"In other words, chlidren need to focus on one thing, the game they are playing, if they want to accive their final goals."	B_S0
"This is a great way to pratice children's focusing ability."	I_S0
"In a research I have seen before."	I_S0
"The research team found tow teams of kids and test for their focus time."	I_S0
"And then, one group was allow to play computer games for half an hour each day while the other team's kids were not promised to play any computer game."	I_S0
"After one month, those children were finished another test of focus, and it showed us that those kids who were allow to play improved about 20% on focus, and the other goup of kids were not change averagely as some were even worse on focus for long."	E_S0
"Admittadly, some people think it is waste of time to play because children can not stop playing in time."	S_M0
"Those people's opinion are not totally wrong, but the advantage of playing computer games are more notable."	B_S1
"So it is better for kids to play computer games a little."	E_S1
"In short, playing computer games have some disadvantages, it is worthwhile for children to play computer game for a little."	S_C2
 
"An increasing number of students choose to spend one year traveling or getting a job before going to university after graduate from high school."	S_T0
"It sounds really intereting,but its disadvantages cannot be ignore."	B_S0
"In my opinion ,students have a hard time duing their high school,and most of them desire a wonderful experience in gap year."	I_S0
"It could help student to get more skills in the year,and the experience can make people learn to conmunicate each other better."	I_S0
"Students in high school dont have much chance to decide what they really like."	I_S0
"they must stduty day and night even their college major may not their own goal."	I_S0
"Now there is a opportunity can be provied for them to do what they really hope for."	I_S0
"Becides of that,the gap would help student broading their horizen and build a rope life goal."	I_S0
"These would be a great tresure in the next years."	I_S0
"In addition to the drawbacks,we should realize that social work do help student grown,but may hurt them at same time."	I_S0
"Out of control from their parents and teachers,lots of childen can not figure which is benefical  and which is harmful, many of them devote too much to travel and work and lose the passion in theeir college major."	I_S0
"We should konw univerity is the ultimate place where  peopel can acquire knowledge ."	I_S0
"Social work or travel can not replace univerity."	I_S0
"Only graduating from univerity,you can get a bachelor degree or master degree even doctor degree."	I_S0
"Cetificates stand for your hard work in past few years,  there can offer you a better job,a better wage."	I_S0
"What the most important is you can save p"	E_S0
 
"In our modern society, some people think that it has a wide range of significances for students to work or travel for a year between graduating from high school and starting university  studies."	S_T1
"However there are also other people hold a oppositive point."	B_S0
"In my oppinion that I really support the point of the fommer."	I_S0
"To work or travel for a year can broaden student's horizons and improve their ability to solve problems independently."	I_S0
"For instance, if a student travel in many foreign countries,they can appreciate many famous museums and try a great number of local delicious foods of foreign ,Moreover they can also further realize the foreign country's cultures,which can help them to get along with their colleagues who come from the forigen countries in the future."	I_S0
"In addition ,when thery are traveling alone , a factor that they have to accept is that they will face many problems and must solve tnem without anyone's help,which can make students develop and improve their ability to solve problems independently."	I_S0
"On another hand,in our modern society ,more and more students are spoiled by their parents and have few exetra knowledge about communicating with each other,since they always study in their room and spend a little time on talking with their parents and good friends,which will make a great variety of negative impacts on students' ability to get along with their friends in the future."	I_S0
"Don't worry ,these thing can be solve through traveling and working for a year."	I_S0
"In conclusio,although now, students have many drawbacks ,don't worry ,traveling to other areas along can help them to overcome these drawbacks,which also shows the advantages of traveling."	E_S0
 
"Despite the rapid development of society, education is no more than a commonplace."	B_I0
"Recently, an interesting question has aroused heated discussion: Should teachers expose their social views to students during the process of teaching?"	I_I0
"Some people think teachers' social and political views is also a kind of instruction."	E_I0
"Others claim that teachers would better only impass knowledge and not influence students' political views."	B_T0
"From my perspective, I agree with the statement that teachers should make their social or political views known to students."	I_T0
"My reasons are as follows."	E_T0
"To begin with, expostion of teachers' political views is kind of instruction to student, which leads to students' forming political conceptions."	S_M1
"It is a common phenomenon in my city that students are busy with their study tasks whole days with intensed nerves thus ignoring the knowledge of policy which is significent after graduating from school."	B_S0
"On the contrary, if the teachers expose the political views on specific things in the society, students will form political conceptions."	I_S0
"With the political knowledge, these students can paticipate actively in the conditions like voting for the leads of the city and affecting other important decesions which influence the future of the city, which is beneficial to both the development of the city and individuals."	E_S0
"On top of that, teachers' social views can prevent students from affecting by harmful views."	S_M1
"Becasue of the immature mental condition, adolecents are not able to identify the harmful views in the society."	B_S0
"They are likey to be influenced by the wrong views without protection and instruction."	I_S0
"However, teachers social views can play the role of correcting wrong views."	I_S0
"Knowing the political views of teachers, students are prone to compare different thoughts of policy thus finding the harmness of the wrong views."	I_S0
"For example, when I was in middle school, my math teachers liked to show her political thoughts of peace in classes, which prevent the thoughts of violence to influence students because students' comparing different thoughts."	E_S0
"Admittedly, there are some disadvantage of showing political views."	B_C0
"Because when teachers' political views are different from views from parents or the mainstream of society, the students will become confused, which is not good for personal development."	I_C0
"However, it also has some advantages like aftering reviewing different kinds of views, students are more likely to have they own conception of policy and society."	I_C0
"To put it into a nutshell, I agree that teachers should show their political or social views in the classroom."	E_C0
 
"People have different ideas about which is the main goal of government of economic progress."	B_I0
"(economic progress or other types)."	E_I0
"Personally, although economic progress is important, others types of progress are as important as economic for a country."	S_T0
"It is true that economy is very important for a country."	S_M1
"Economy is regarded as a way to measure the development level of a country, which is also the goal of a country's development."	B_S1
"A country's sound economic system can make the country move forward steadily and create more opportunities for people to make money and improve living conditions."	E_S1
"However, I don't think economic progress represents everything."	S_M1
"Progress in other areas is equally important."	B_S0
"If a country wants to become a real great power, it should go from system, politics, economy to military, without exception."	I_S0
"National politics determines the degree of cooperation between the country and its people, as well as the leadership of its leaders."	I_S0
"Those who win the hearts of the people win the world, which shows the importance of political foundation."	I_S0
"Military defense force is the guarantee of a country's security and the ability of sustainable development."	E_S0
"In conclusion, economy is obviously the key symbol of a country's success, but also the political system and military power of the country are very important."	S_C2
 
"Nowadays,some people believe that young people are more likely to be with their friend and family,because they are full of energy and enthusiasm."	B_I0
"Thus,there is no doubt that young people are possible to have more chance to meet or help others."	I_I0
"Howerer,other people says young people do not give enough time to helping their coummunities with the rapid develpoment of technology and society."	I_I0
"Which opinion do you agree?"	E_I0
"In my opinion,I firmly believe the latter one."	S_T0
"The reasons are as follows."	S_S2
"First of all,there are less and less communication between young people and communities."	S_M1
"For the widespread use of technology such as mobile phones,computers and so on,most of the young people are addicted to computer games."	B_S0
"They tend to be inactive and unwilling to talk with others even their close friends or parents."	I_S0
"Take my cousin as an example,he used to be such an active and outgoing student and always took part in various competitions and activities."	I_S0
"What's more, he is so helpful that always tried his best yo help others."	I_S0
"Somehow,he was crazy about computer games."	I_S0
"The only thing he wanted to do was playing games in his bedroom all day."	I_S0
"Thus,he even did not have other time to talk with others."	E_S0
"Second,young people are faced with great pressure from society."	S_M1

"There is an debate about whether advertisements make people buy the same products and prevent them from being different individuals."	S_I0
"I strongly disagree with this argument for two main reasons."	S_T1
"First and foremost, it has already been a fact that everyone is a different individual the moment thay are born and it is nonsense to say that simply an advertisement can change this."	S_M1
"The task to keep people from being different individuals is so challenging that there is no way ads can acheive so."	B_S0
"And what is more important is that the very purpose of why ads are created has nothing to do with make people the same."	I_S0
"They are aimed to urging people to buy a certain product, just like every other kind of propaganda."	I_S0
"Everyone is still an indenpedent individual as there is nothing wrong with thinking the same idea as other people think, which is a bound impact of all the propagandas."	E_S0
"It is also worth noticing that we are living in an information era where people have to accept tons of different infomation everyday, including ads."	S_M1
"Thus, it goes without saying that advertisements cannot have a significant influence as most of people will not even pay attention to the ads or have little impression of them."	B_S1
"The convenience of information conveying also make advertisements competitive themselves, which means there are more than one idea among all the ads, let alone seduce people into being the same."	E_S1
"To make a long story short, advertisements are nothing more than a method of commerical propaganda."	S_C2
"In terms of discouraging people from being different individuals, we might as well worry a little more about those political propaganda rather than commercial ads."	S_S2
 
"Our society is a "wasteful"society,because people nowadays value convenience more than protecting the environment."	B_T1
"For convenience,we may want to throw away rubbish at will,for example,we often throw away a lot of rubbish that we can not handle at will, such as plastic bags and batteries."	I_T1
"It is also possible to discard televisions,cell phones,computers and other old items and replace them with new ones that will inevitably become future junk."	E_T1
"I think  it is necessary for governments to make recycling a legal requirement and "punish"those who throw away recyclable materials."	S_M2
"For example,the law may require familiesto divide all rubbish into separate bins for recycling,or impose a fine."	B_S1
"New waste management rules should be developed as a law calling for strict compliance with recycling standards."	E_S1
"At the same time,Governments can increase recycling and improve people's commom homes by changing people's behaviour through media dissemination."	S_S2
 
"This is particularly true for trees in the middle and upper latitudes, which tend to attain greater heights on ridges, whereas in the tropics the trees reach their greater heights in the valley."	S_I0
"For example, some early societies ceased to consider certain rites essential to their well-beings and abandoned them, nevertheless, they retained as parts of their oral tradition the myths that had grown up around the rites and admired them for their artistic qualities rather than for their religious usefulness."

"In areas where considerable soil still remains, though, a rigorously enforced program of land protection and cover-crop planting may make it possible to reverse the present deterioration of the surface."	I_S2
"In order for the structure to achieve the size and strength necessary to meet its purpose, architecture employs methods for support that, because they are based on physical laws, have changed little since people first discovered them – even while building materials have changed dramatically."

"The auther in the reading passage stated that although online ncyclopedia sounds attractive, it has several problems that remains to solve, which makes online encyclopedia less valuable than traditional ones."	S_I0
"The first problem of online encyclopedia is that the contributors are lack of accademic trains in this case, there will be inacurate things in it."	S_M0
"However, the professor argues that, there is also errors in traditional encyclopedia, if we go and find a perfect one then we will never get."	S_S2
"The second problem stated by the author is that, risk of being hacked in, deleted and  fabricated."	S_M0
"But the professor in the lecture do not by this."	B_S0
"She gives 2 ways that an online encyclopedia used to prevent this from happening."	I_S0
"For starter, there is special techniques protecting it."	I_S0
"Furthermore, a professional technician is hired to identify and eliminate the bad thing proposed."	E_S0
"Finally, the auther proclaims that the too much focus on one topic of online encyclopedia will eventually lead to false impressions of what is important."	S_M0
"And the professor in the lecture rejected this theory by claiming that to be specific on each topic is one of the advantage of online encyclopedia, since they do not restricted by the space of paper that used for print things as the traditional ones do."	B_S1
"That is actually why online encyclopedia is better than the tradional ones."	E_S1
 
"In my opinion, offer school-age children money for their high score is not a good idea."	S_T0
"First, school-age children are still on their way to observe the world and learn from it."	S_M1

"The most direct way to change the situation is let the governments of richer nations to help them."	E_S0
"On the other hand,there are some reasons that this solution is not a really suitable way in some aspects."	S_M1
"Firstly,every nation has their own problems."	B_S0
"It is also important for the governments of richer nations to help those people who live in rural areas of their nations."	I_S0
"It is not fair for those people to give money to other poor countries instead of them."	I_S0

"On the other hand,because the improvement of medical care makes the elderly more and more."	I_S0

"It is true that the quality of TV programms may fall if too many of them are made by just a few groups because of the limit of resources input such as time and money."	I_S0
"And there are indeed examples of failure that a good TV programm was finally cancelled due to other new programms' need for key resources."	I_S0

"As we know, the principle to win the competition is to create something attracting people, which is the core competence of the group."	I_S0
"So it is common that a group has one core TV programm with the most time and money input while running other small programms at the same time."	I_S0
"We can see easily that the most valuable programm of a group usually won't be affected much by other programms."	I_S0

"I still remember last semester when I finished a computer science project alone and the mixture of a sense of satisfactory and accomplishment I got from it."	B_I0
"I'm convinced that many people will be familiar with this feeling."	E_I0
"So when it comes the question that which methods can let the students learn more effectively when they handle their assignment, I think working alone is a better one because students can learn every aspect of the knowledge and have a better understanding of them."	S_T0
"Firstly, working alone can make the students understand the whole content of the knowledge."	S_M1
"It's common sense that when you work in a group, you don't need to do all the work, what you are required to finish is just part of it."	B_S0
"This condition can also occur when teachers ask students to finish their assignment together."	I_S0
"However, contrary to working together, working alone means you have to do all the work that is related to the project."	I_S0
"Consequently, you can go through all the knowledge and learn to use them to solve the problem, which will result in learning all aspects of the knowledge."	E_S0
"Moreover, you can have a comprehensive understanding of the knowlege and digest them competely when you finish the assignment alone."	S_M1
"Being confronted with problems in the course of dealing with the assignment is common."	B_S0
"When you work in a group, the group member may tell you what's wrong with your work or help you get out of it."	I_S0
"Even though the result is that the problem is solved, because you don't know the theory in it, you learn nothing."	I_S0
"On the other hand, you are supposed to finish the problem on your own when you work alone."	I_S0
"For example, when you are dealing with a math problem."	I_S0
"You use all the theories, examples and methods you have learnt to try to work it out."	I_S0
"When you finish the problem eventually, your math ability increased a lot."	E_S0
"Lastly, even though some people may argue that working together can let the student working on difficult problems or projects of a larger scale, which cann't be done when students work alone."	B_C1
"However, what we are talking now is how to let students learn effectively rather that how to let students work on a bigger project."	E_C1

"In a family, it is a commen situation that two parents only fouse on one child, so that they become afraid that their child making mistake because they worry the children hurt them selves."	E_T1
"However, in my opinion, it is necessary and benificial for children to make mistakes and learn from their own mistakes."	S_T0
"First of all, making mistakes and learing from it can help children to have more exprence."	S_M1
"when children make mistakes, they will know what is wrong, and then they can study for how to crect it."	B_S0
"At next, they will not make same mistakes again."	I_S0
"Making myself as an example, when I answered some math questions wrong, I will collect them on my book, and when the teacher test it next time, I can hand out a good answer."	I_S0
"All of the mistakes in the test are becoming my personal exprence to help me getting a good grade."	I_S0
"What is more, this exprence is significant and can never be instead because when children try to corect the mistakes, they need to solve a sum of problems."	E_S0
"Secondly, when parents let children  make mistakes and learn from their own mistakes, children will be more brave to face challenge in the future."	S_M1

"It can make them stay away from their school with negative thoughts on studying."	I_S0
"It will be have many reasons,but I think its the most important at follows."	I_S0
"On the one hand,maybe some of teachers are strite with them in order to  make them to be a better one, but the students don't care the teachers feeling, they always on them own ways to do things."	I_S0
"On the other hands,there are many classes, but  many of them are tremendous."	I_S0
"It can't attractive students to be intersted in them."	I_S0
"And there are little outdoor activities so that students have heavy stress."	I_S0
"Form my perspective,teachers can give students enough time to receive what they want to express, and be more patient with them."	I_S0
"Then the students have more space to make the right decesion."	I_S0
"School can open some intereting activities which suits student's development."	I_S0
"If school and teachers can make diffrence,the students will change their minds and have permissive attitude on studying."	E_S0

"Whether group works can help students to learn more efficiently is a purely personal questions."	B_I0
"Some people like to work in a group while others like to work in individuals."	E_I0
"In my opnion, I disagree work in a group cna help us leanr mroe efiicient because when are learning in a group, we will have a lots of distractions from others or sometimes we are trying to get a free-ride from others and then we can learn nothng."	S_T1
"Firstly, in a group projects, we are going to get a lots of distractions from others."	S_M1
"There are people who like to keep talking to their friends in the group or there are someone that lways force others to accept his or her opinion even he or she is wrong."	B_S0
"However, if we are working in indiviuals, there will be no distractons from other people."	I_S0
"For example, once I was doing a group project in my middle school, at that time we were asked to analyze a Chinese poem."	I_S0
"At the beginning there were two people that kept talking loud which freuqently disturb my from my own work, and even if we asked them to stop, they did not stop and talked even louder."	I_S0
"It took a long time for us to complete because of their loud conversation."	I_S0
"Later on, when we were sharing our ideas, there was one person kept talking about his own opinion and used stupid reasons to dismiss others opinion even his point was wrong and that mislead all of us and we submitted a very bad projects and I barely learned anything about the poem."	I_S0
"Therefore, group study cannot always outweight individual studying."	E_S0
"Furthermore, sometime when we feel lazy when we are participting in a group project, we just want to get a free ride from others and then we cannot learn anything."	S_M1
"On the other hand, when we are doing things by ourselves, we are forcing to finish the work individually and there is no way for us to depend on others to finish te work."	B_S0
"For instance, one of my friends was working with me and two other group member to do a research about of an article."	I_S0
"He was really reluctant to work on this project at first so he just letting the resting of our group to finish the job."	I_S0
"On the other day there is a test about this research, because my friend did not work on this research at all, so he eventually failed the test because he did nt learn anything from these group work."	I_S0
"So, group project are not always the best choice for students to learn effectively because when we are just depend on others to finish the project, we cannot learn anything from it."	E_S0
"Comparing the disadvantages that study in group have to the advantages that individual work has, group project are not always the bet choice to help students learn effectively."	S_C2

"Although we are unable to determine the most crucial cause on this matter, there are lots of relevant factors that we can easily render to."	I_S0
"On the one hand, most public schools admit a large number of students while teachers are very limited."	I_S0
"As a result, most teachers are not allowed to put efforts on every single students equally."	I_S0
"Usually they make arrangements on behalf of the whole class and focus on obtaining high scores."	I_S0
"Some students may feel less confident and are less likely to enjoy studying once their grades fall behind."	I_S0
"On the other hand, with the rising population and the fierce competition , students are pushed forward by the exam-oriented educationsystem and the majority are forced to take heavy schoole work burdens when they are quite young without permission to think about where their interests lie."	I_S0
"Gradually, adverse thoughts turn out and make students feel reluctant to go to school."	I_S0
"I think it is very important to make a change on this problem as quick as possible."	I_S0
"Firstly, the present education mechanism should be reversed and grades should not be the only criteria to njudge a student."	I_S0
"Secondly, the goverment must put more money on the construction of all kind of schools with different courses and activities in order to suit the needs of various students."	I_S0
"Besides, every school should be equipped with ample and high standards teachers whom can teach students in accordence with their aptitude."	I_S0
"To sum up, if we tend to change the situation presented before us, it is necessary to do the real job from now on."	I_S0

"In this set of material, the reading passage discusses that although hail makes farmers suffer a lot, the cloud seeding can protect the crops from disaster."	O
"There are 3 facts support this opinion whereas the listening passage provides a contradictory view."	S_I0
"The listening passage weakens the reading."	O
"Firstly, it is said in the passage that laboratory experiments have already supported that cloud seeding is effective in eliminating hail."	S_M1
"However, the lecture suggests the opposite."	B_S0
"The speaker says that it is true that hail can be turned into snow and rain, it is still possible that snow, rain, and hail are prevented by cloud seeding, which will cause drought in the crops."	I_S0
"The crops will be damaged because of lacking water."	E_S0
"Secondly, the passage indicates that cloud seeding in Asia has been successfully used to control precipitation in urban areas."	S_M1
"In contrast, the lecture suggests otherwise."	B_S0
"It says that it can not be used in the united states' farmland."	I_S0
"Because urban areas are suffered from high-level air pollution."	I_S0
"Pollution can interact with cloud seeding."	I_S0
"As a result, this evidence can not support US crops."	E_S0
"Thirdly, the passage states that local studies also support the value of cloud seeding."	B_C0
"The lecture claims a different picture in this case as well."	I_C0
"It argues that it is not convincing, because hail damage in whole America not just decrease in the central United States."	I_C0
"So it is hard to say that cloud seeding is the main factor protect the crops."	I_C0

"More channels can give them more options,which is a result of promotion of people's requirment."	I_S0
"Besides, too many practitioners in TV program making would not give rise to their poor broadcast results, which actually a good opportunity to promote better quality."	I_S0
"If there are more producer join the program making, the competition between them would occur."	I_S0
"And it would force them to produce program with higher quality."	I_S0
"Otherwise, they may suffer from failure because of less spectators."	I_S0
"For example, Runningman, a program in Korean has been stoped beacause there aren't any creative thought produced and seemed not better than other programs."	I_S0

"In my opinion, this statement is not entirely right."	E_T0
"The answer varies with the different peoplr , different time and so on."	S_T1
"For example, to those who likes physic  very much and do not like reading, It is more relaxing for him to do some physical exercise than to read a book."	S_M1
"However, to a reading-liker,a movie-liker or a writer, a movie or a nice book can be the best medicine for their exhoust."	B_S1
"In this case, the result is different because the different hobbies different peoplr have."	E_S1
"In another occassion, it varies because of the different experiences."	S_M1
"We can assume that there is a person who have taken an important exam right now and a person who have just taken a music course, there is no denying that they have different answer to this question."	B_S0

"From my point of view, the controller of media can't take control the way a population think and view the world."	S_I0
"Admittedly, those who control the way how media present the news, to some extent, can alter the public's attitude towards a certain phenomenon or news event."	S_M1
"Such alterence may be realized by hiding part of the truth or by committing some logical fallacies initiatively when presenting the news."	B_S0
"With more resources to get news information and being familiar with the subject of logic, educated people can easily avoid those tricks from media controller."	I_S0
"They might also process a concrete view towards the world and will not be manipulated easily."	I_S0

"When we meet some strangers who are lack of cloths and food, kind people will have compassion and passion to give them a hand."	E_I0
"They can get a sense of happiness and kindness."	B_T0
"However, some people think that these days people are not that willing to help the people they don't know than they were in the past."	I_T0
"In my opinion, it is convincing with several reasons."	E_T0
"Initially, the biggest and the most important reason why people are prone to keep their hands off the people they are not familiar when they need help is the people's moral value shift from the past to the present."	S_M1
"In the past, the villages are groups of people that work together to reach the economic and argricultural goal the government made."	B_S0
"they are in the same boat in some way."	I_S0
"Hence, when some people are in need of cloths and foods, even they are strangers."	I_S0
"we tend to help them."	I_S0
"However, with the development of urbanlization, people are more selfish and utilitarian than before."	I_S0
"They think that people are supposed to depend on themselves."	I_S0
"Besides, under the pressure of buying houses and cars, the people in big cities don't have many resources to offer to others for free."	I_S0
"They are competing for the oppotunities to survive in big cities actually, so they won't be much willing to give the strangers a hand."	E_S0
"Second, people in the present are not trusting each other as they were in the past."	S_M1
"We should not neglect a very common and reflectable phenomenon."	B_S0
"Some old people tend to fall on the street right in front of the passagers on purpose and blame them for moeny."	I_S0
"So people are very cautious when travelling outside and don't choose to waste time helping those who need clothing and foods."	I_S0
"Even if they do, the strangers may ask for more and more."	I_S0
"As a result, it is very troublesome."	E_S0
"Admittedly, some individuals may believe that people are more willing to help others these days because the trend of globalization."	B_C0
"Different people in different countries will choose to help each others when facing the common crisis such as the recent epidemic situation."	I_C0
"They know exactly the rule that helping others is helping themselves."	I_C0
"People in the earth are sharing the same fate, and thus when others countries are lack of disposal face masks, we Chinese people are very willing to provide the resources."	I_C0
"However, we should notice that in many countries, people are still not that truth worthy when China give them a hand."	I_C0
"Even though Chinese people offered American people lots of experience to fight the virus, many of them still think that Chinese people are those who should be blamed and even call the virus Wuhan virus."	E_C0

"Today,many young students are leaving schools with nagative thoughts on studying."	S_T0
"They don't want to go further study,neither go to a good university nor go abroad to study."	B_S0
"This is a very bad phenomenon."	I_S0
"But what causes it?"	I_S0
"First,we focus on the parents."	I_S0
"Many parents want their children to be good in the future."	I_S0
"So they give their children too much preesure instead of considering the child's thoughts which will make the kids feel stressed and have a negative attitude towards study."	I_S0
"If things go on like this,more and more students will get tired of learning."	I_S0
"I have a classmate who has afored said situation."	I_S0
"Her parents always push her hard,They let her go to a lot of classes after school."	I_S0
"So she looks tired every day and she even doesn't want to study anymore."	I_S0
"Next reason of this phenomenon is that the social environment."	I_S0
"Nowadays,the development of science and technology is becoming more and more fast."	I_S0
"Mobile phones,computers are so developed which has brought us a lot of temptation."	I_S0
"Compared with the boring studying,many students will lose themselfves in the virtual world."	I_S0
"As a result,they will give up their studying."	I_S0
"There are still many other causes about this phenomenon."	I_S0
"Now,we should think about what can we do to imoruve the situation."	I_S0
"The most important thing is that we should let our parents know what our thoughs are and then we will be able to have less streesure."	I_S0
"Another thing we are supposed to do is keeping the electronic product away from us."	I_S0
"Only we do these,can we improve the situation that young studentd leave school with negative thoughts."	E_S0
 
"Is the era of our grandparents beatific?"	B_I0
"Is it more fortunate for us in nowadays society?"	I_I0
"With the technological development, there are increasing number of recreational facilities appear, and various type of the transportation occur, my life is more satisfied and convenient."	I_I0
"As a result, from my perspective, the life today is better than it was several decades ago."	E_I0
"On the one hand, the development of technology renders the life splendid."	S_M1
"To be more convincible, a large number of electronic devices were invented, like the cellular phone, MP5, Pad and so on."	B_S0
"All of them can enrich the leisure, but when our grandparents were children, everything was dissimilar."	I_S0
"There are no better illustration to prove this point than the instance of my grandfather, everytimes he watch me when I enjoy the happiness of the video games, he says"when I was a child, I did not has anything to play, just managing my farm and do some sport, its quite tired and boring to tears！""	I_S0
"Obviously, it is fortunate for me to born in the contemporary society, since I can enjoy the sophisticated equipment that can make me joyful."	E_S0
"On the other hand, the development of transportation renders our life easier and convenient."	S_M1
"To be more specific, several decades ago, when we intended to go somewhere, we can only go there by foot or the older bicycles."	B_S0
"However, in the nowadays society, we can do it by car or the airplant wherever."	I_S0
"For instance, when my grandmother was a child, she must take bike to the destination that was 10 kilometres far for her about 8 hours."	I_S0
"However, when I what to go a place that 100 kilometres far for me, I just take car by only one hours."	I_S0
"So nowadays societ is more convenient."	E_S0

"Nowadays, with the dramatically increase in spiritual needs of people over the world, more and more people go to the museums on weekends or holidays."	S_I0
"Some museums are free while others are charging."	S_T1
"In my opinion, it is quite important for the museum to charge the citizens."	S_T0
"There are some positive aspect brought by the free museums."	S_M1
"For example, there are more people would like to visit the museum rather than an entertainment centre for the free tickets of museum, which would help more people to extend their knowledge of history and culture."	B_S0
"But it must exist some problems, first, more people means more crowded which is so terrible for the experiences of other visitors."	I_S0
"And for the free tickets, some people may visit the museums just for fun rather than getting knowledge, some individuals even would talk loudly, eat or drink in such a serious place."	E_S0
"On the other hand, what would happen if a museum charge."	S_M1
"First, it would filter the terrible people because they would never spend money on a museum."	B_S0
"Secondly, charging means less people which leads a quiet atmosphere for the visitors to enjoy the items there."	I_S0
"Thirdly, charging would evoke the public to realise the value of the museum, which would make the visitors more serious and careful during the visiting period."	I_S0
"Finally, the charge is a kind of donation in some ways, which help to maintain and protect the precious treasure in the museums."	E_S0
"In conclusion, charging is such a clever and win-win strategy to upgrade the experience of the visitors while maintaining the items in the museum."	B_C1
"Meanwhile, it would boost the enthusiasm of the staff in the museums."	E_C1
 
"As shown in the table,  in the 1990s these were three causes of land degradation by region."	S_T1

"The figure for total land degraded on Europe was highest in 1990s, at 23%,in contrast, North America, with the lowest overall percentage of land degraded (5%),also suffered from over-cultivation."	E_S1
 
"Now many students leave the school , they go to work with the market or restaurant ."	S_I0
"I think the young people leave the shool is not they do not like study ,they think study is useless and boring ,they can find the work or stay at home ,NO teacher ,NO homework,they can do anything they want."	S_T1
"Some students want to study,but they can not get good grade,the teach are very angry ,do some excessive move, the student lose the confidence ,then they leave the school."	B_S0

"When thinking about the issue that whether parents should offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school,different people have different ideas."	B_I0
"While some people may believe money stimulates children to work hard to get good mark continully, I think that it might cause children to learn just for money other than intrests and fun."	E_I0
"Parents do expect their children to get good marks in exam, because they want their children to have a brighter future."	S_T1
"But stimulations like money will let childrens think they learn just in order to earn more money."	S_M0
"This way copletely ruins the begining of education."	B_S0
"The principle of education is to build nomative citizions and thus make the future of the society harmonious."	I_S0
"Using money to stimulate children will make them becoming some people who live for their own intrests."	I_S0
"So they will be selfish."	E_S0
"Second, using money as rewards may make cheating in the exam becoming more and more."	S_M0
"If a child can get good marks in the way of cheat instead of answering the questions honestly, he or she may become a dishonest person."	B_S1
"The children grow in this way could do anything even illegal to achieve his or her goal in the future."	E_S1
"Third, although things like money can be a reward to make children work harder in study."	S_M0
"But it should be limited and not being used frequently."	B_S0
"We know human like other animals are active to reward."	I_S0
"But human must live in a more moral way instead of living by stimulates."	I_S0
"Thats what makes us human different from other anmials."	I_S0
"We have dreams and rules, and we can enjoy the fun of thinking learning new knowledges."	E_S0
"After all, it will be better for parents not to use money as a reward for high grade their children get in school."	S_C2
 
"The provided flow diagram describes how to produce the cement and use cement to produce the concrete."	B_I0
"It is clear that there are materials and stages used for production."	I_I0
"There are some differences between two processes."	E_I0
"The process of making cement uses a number of tools while the production of concrete requires only a concrete mixer."	S_T1
"In the first stage of making cement, limestone and clay are crushed together to powder."	S_M2
"This powder is processed in the mixer and then put into the rotatuing heater to heat."	B_S0
"The heated production is grinded by the grinder and then become the cement."	I_S0
"Finally the cement is put into bags to be used for making concrete."	E_S0
"According to the second diagram, 10% water is added into 50% gravel that is small stones, and then mix with 15% cement and 25% sand in the concrete mixer which continually rotates to combine the materials above and produces concrete."	S_C2
 
"In today society,with the living standard instantly increasing,people have ate too much which cause a lot of health problems."	S_T1

"Thus,the government has put a large quantity of sports facilities into construction."	I_S0
"however,to make great progress,in my view ,other measured are also significant."	I_S0
"To begin with,Mind determines actions."	I_S0
"It will be the first step that the awareness of unhealth should be awaken."	I_S0
"Only when people realize the are not sa healthy as they imagine,can they have motivation to exercise."	I_S0
"What's more,professional courses and teachers are in great need."	I_S0
"Without other's help,one cannot get access to the proper method to exercise."	I_S0
"Take me for example,I tried many times to loose my weight,such as swimming,hiking and even going on a diet."	I_S0
"Frustrating,I didn't make it."	I_S0
"thanks to my teacher,he told me how to exercise and encouraged me not to give up."	I_S0
"WIth constant efforts,fianally,I made it."	I_S0
"Last but not least,everyone shall have determination."	I_S0
"It will be a long way to return to health,and it will also be a long way to be in health condition."	I_S0
"Sometimes,we may feel upset and even want to give up because of no visuable change of body."	I_S0
"Believe in it that changes has taken place,with constantly efforts, you will be perfect physically and mentally."	I_S0
"Above of all,we should make full use of sports facilities where we have chance to exercise,however,it's more crucial for us to be motivated by overselves and get ready all the time."	E_S0
 
"As the visa policies gradually improved, it has gradually become  convenient for those who want to live abroad, which means that you are supposed to speak a foreign language in a foreign country, with both positive and negative impacts."	S_T1
"Advocates believe that living in a foreign country and speaking a foreign language does facilitate to get a profond insight into the local culture."	B_S0
"Initially, we can have communication with foreigners via the foreign language, getting to know their life style, preferences as well as hobbies, which helps us better adapt to the life there and alleviate the cultural shock."	I_S0
"Besides, we can experience their life and culture on our own, finding the difference between countries' cultures and having a better understanding of the culture there."	I_S0
"Additionally, an exotic country's living experience laso offers to improve our ability of adaptation."	I_S0
"Living out of our comfortable and familiar zone, we are forced to renew our initial thought and give up some old habbits, in order to merge into a completely new society."	I_S0
"During this period, our ability of adaptation would be improved, thus we are supposed to behave better provided that new circumstances were given."	I_S0
"Notheless, there are still opponents worrying that living in a foreign country may cause serious social and pratical problems."	I_S0
"If you were not able to adapt the life in a different country, also with a poor language, you would find it hard to communicate with others and complete your assignment or work, thus resulting in your feeling of solitude and low efficiency in your study or work."	I_S0
"Considering the fact that many immigrations come back to their initial countries, this opinion makes sense as well."	I_S0
"Overall, whether living in a foreign country is beneficial should depend on your own character and ability to adapt new circumstance."	E_S0
 
"I agree with you to some extent, but I still think that family is the biggest factor affecting children."	S_T1
"Research shows that domestic violence is very common in young people's crime."	B_S0
"It's usually the behavior of parents that causes children's psychological trauma and distorts children's mind."	I_S0
"External factors stimulate children's crime."	I_S0
"In addition to the physical harm to the victims, domestic violence is also accompanied by the mental destruction of the victims."	I_S0
"Victims suffer from domestic violence for a long time, and their spirit is in high tension and fear under the violence, which easily causes irreversible harm to their mental state."	I_S0
"Mental wounds are more difficult to heal than physical ones."	I_S0
"For me My parents' family's words and actions have had a profound impact on me."	I_S0
"My father's violent tendency led to my childhood spent in the dark."	I_S0
"He has made a great impact on my life, which makes me feel inferior and unable to talk about my family when I communicate with my friends  but I'm glad that my mother is a very reasonable person who knows right from wrong  She taught me how to be a human being and let me get out of the trauma of my heart again, so based on my own experience,  I don't agree with the influence of external factors on my life I think family is the most influential thing in a child's life, which is far greater than anything elseI don't agree to a large extent that the impact of the outside world on children's lives is as great as that of the family."	I_S0
"Thats all Thank you"	E_S0

"There has been a heated discussion about the fact that whether the economic development is the most significant goal."	B_T0
"I personally believe that there are some other kinds of progress should be noticed."	E_T0
"It is understandable why some individuals insist that governments should give priority to the economic progress."	S_M1
"To begin with,the better development of economy enable people live in a better living stantard."	B_S0
"People who earn more money can afford more consumer goods,including housing,cars and some luxury items,which can bring about enjoyment and happiness."	I_S0
"Secondly,the capital  can stimulate other development of industries."	I_S0
"An increasing number of high-cutting technology can be created with enough money,which not only can help people in daily life,but also they can fulfill people's dream."	I_S0
"For instence,the robots can work in some dangerous working environment and people can travel to space with spaceships."	E_S0
"However,I hold a different view."	S_M1
"First of all,people should also take environmental protection into consideration."	B_S0
"Because of the industrial revolution,the natural environment has been damaged in many ways,such as the deforestion,the pollution of water and soil,even many wild animals are on the verge of extinction."	I_S0
"People have to realize that we will also die out if we do not take masures to preserve our Earth."	I_S0
"Besides,the governments should offer more funds to the public services."	I_S0
"Some people need the financial support from governments."	I_S0
"Otherwise,people who cannot afford the tuition fees have to drop off school,which make it difficult for them to find job oppotunities."	I_S0
"As a result,they are unlikely to maintain basic living needs and break the cycle of poverty."	E_S0
"In conclusion,even though the development of economy is crucial for nations,I still reckon that government should pay attention to other fields."	S_C2
 
"From the picture we can clearly see that the quantities of goods transported in the UK has always been rising."	S_T1

of goods transoported in water are rising ,while the other is dropping."	I_S0
"but luckily ,it is also become popular scince 1998."	I_S0
"It seems that the quantities transported in pipeline is the smallest ,but it is always rising and keep its quantities between 1994 and 2002."	I_S0
"We can draw the conclusion that the quantities of the goods transported in the uk are all rising ,and the most is it in the road ,the  
latter is it in the water ,the latter is it in the rail and the last is it in the pipeline."	E_S0
 
"The turtle excluder device (TED) is a device that is incorporated into the nets and provides a passage through which the turtles can escape to help turtles endangerd."	B_I0
"According to the passage, TEDs have been criticized for several reasons."	E_I0
"However, the speker says the TEDs are good for protecting endangered sea turtle species."	S_T1
"First, the writer of the passage claims that the turtles only get trapped rarely, about one yurtle a month."	S_M0
"The speaker argues hat actually there are thousands of turtles being found in the U.S, and they are endangered spices of turtles."	B_S1
"If people don't use TEDs, that would be a big problem for turtles endangerd."	E_S1
"Second, the writer mentions that there are alternative ways to protect sea turtles, one is limiting the time the nets keeped underwater."	S_M0
"The speaker points out that it is hard for the government to moniter the time under the water."	S_S2
"Last, the writer claims that this way won't work for the larger sea turtles."	S_M0
"Some of the large turtles like loggerhead and leatherback cannot fit the net."	B_S0
"The speaker points out that the size of the nets can be larger, it is not a problem of design."	I_S0

"However,there are a lot of shortcomings."	I_S0
"Because stuedents stay home,their teacher don't know if they study hard at home."	I_S0
"And,some bad students cheat on their exams."	I_S0
"Then,students taking class online study alone."	I_S0
"They hardly play with friends."	I_S0
"They just can chat on the Internet."	I_S0
"In this way,they will be faraway from teachers and classmates."	E_S0

"Recently, whether to help struggling strangers has become a hitting topic."	S_T1
"It seems that more and more people are willing to help others, which is a huge change comparing with the past."	B_T0
"From my opinion, it may caused by a more positive environment, people's growing abilities and trustive information."	E_T0
"Firstly, it is obvious that no matter the government or the public are suggest to build a friendly and kind society, which greatly influents and encourages all the people to become more helpful."	S_M0
"For example, on the most popular social platform, Weibo, many stars and thouse people with infiuence are likely to share their activities about helping people in difficulties and post the anouncement such as helping poor mother find baby."	B_S1
"Those really provide a encouraging environment to let people help others."	E_S1
"In addition, with the economy fast developing,people are much more rich then before, which means they have greter abilities to help those struggling strangers."	S_M0
"Maybe a man is really kind and warmhearted."	B_S0
"But in the past, he can't even fit himself."	I_S0
"However, with the development of the society,he also become richer the before and now he can do what he wants in the past."	E_S0
"At last, I think people were afraid to help others because they were scared to be cheated."	S_M0
"Everyone earns their money very hard, nobody want to spend it on a wrong person."	B_S1
"But nowadays,we have more trchnology to identify who is really struggling."	E_S1
 
"In these days, a significant increase in the number of TV channels has depicted a favourable change in the standard of living, since the audience could have a variety of choices in TV programmes for the purpose of relax and entertainment."	S_T1
"However, there is another point of view, alternatively, that too many TV programs would lead to many low-quality programs in the market."	B_S0
"The following discussion would focus on these two opinions and a conclusion will be drawn in the end."	I_S0
"On the one hand, the benefits of the diversity in TV channels are obvious."	I_S0
"Firstly, a wide variety for selection can satisfy different preferences, such as sports, geography and even shopping advertisements."	I_S0
"Hence, the satisfaction resulted from the wide variety could greatly enhance the well-being and happiness of the audience, which also demonstrates an upward trend in the level of living standards."	I_S0
"Furthermore, the huge availability of choices in TV programmes can attract more funds from investments and advertisements."	I_S0
"Consequently, the more funds invested in the TV programs, the more diversity of programs can be produced so that a positive loop can be created."	I_S0
"Nevertheless, everything in the world can be a double-edged sword."	I_S0
"Excessive TV channels are bound to lower the overall quality of the programs."	I_S0
"Two reasons can be attributed to this point."	I_S0
"Firstly, the resources of production are limited in terms of the time, electricity and human capital."	I_S0
"When the number of programs is out of control, the management and the production will accordingly become insufficient and ineffective."	I_S0
"Furthermore, the innovation will   be lost in too many TV channels for the reason that the replication and repetition is reasonably foreseeable in terms of content, hosting styles and targeted corhort of audience."	I_S0
"Even though, greater capital can be brought in by the positive loop mentioned before, resource and innovation are natural constraints of TV channels that cannot be circumvented."	I_S0
"In conclusion, the number of TV channels should be controlled under a reasonable number of amout to maximise its efficiency and efficacy."	E_S0
 
"People have a intense discussion when it comes to whether the economic progress is the key role in the development of country."	S_I0
"Despite the fact that economic progress is essential,I suppose that we should still give priority  to other factors."	S_T0
"Admittedly,economic growth plays a significant role in the construction of the nation."	S_M1
"Several reasons account to such standpoint."	B_S0
"First of all,economy is the lifeblood of a country."	I_S0
"Without a strong economy,a country cannot even stand on the world stage in this era."	I_S0
"Besides,better economic progress can improve people's living standards."	I_S0
"In the meanwhile,the government may have access to perfect the infrastructure and pay more attention to public service."	E_S0
"However,evaluating a country's comprehensive strength is not just about its economic progress."	S_M1
"There are many other factor that matter too."	B_S0
"For instance,environmental progress is now becoming more and more considerable."	I_S0
"In the past,people pursue economic development unilaterally but neglect the environmental construction."	I_S0
"Nowaday,our country is promoting the view thatl lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets."	I_S0
"We also advocate harmonious coexistence between humans and nature, and stick to the path of green and sustainable development."	I_S0
"Last but not leat,w\the medical level construction slso counts."	I_S0
"The medical and health service is related to the health of hundreds of millions of people, to the happiness of thousands of families, and to the livelihood of the people."	I_S0
"We should deepen the reform of the medical and health system, accelerate the development of medical and health undertakings, meet the growing needs of the people for medical and health care, and constantly improve the health quality of the people."	E_S0
"In conclusion,the economic progress is importan but we should also pay attention to other factors."	S_C2
 
"I really agree with this idea."	B_T1
"I think it is a good idea that parents fooer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school."	E_T1
"there are some reasons about my ideas."	S_T0
"Firstly,I think children need encourage for their effort."	S_M1
"Though children do not need too much money during thier life,they want to buy someting like balls or tools for study."	B_S0
"If they have access to choose purchase small goods, they will learn more knowledge outside the book."	I_S0
"also, they will perfer to study more hardly to get high grade."	E_S0
"Secondly,children need more recogntion and support from their parents, they will believe high grade means parise and love."	S_M1
"And also with devoloping of the technology, there are some many learning tools on the maket."	B_S1
"they could use the money to buy something they want, or but some gift to send to their friend when they attends to their friend'birthday party."	E_S1
"Last but not least, I don't think parent should give too much monty that children maybe do not take advantage of these bonuses."	S_C2
"The parents should ask their school-age children not to buy things that have bad influence on study,such as Game Machine, blue moives and so on."	B_S1
"Also parent could know the use about the money when they give money to their children."	E_S1
 
"Have you ever annoyed by your parents because they always replace you to do various decision?"	B_I0
"However, in the past many youths are pleased with thier parents to help them make their decision."	E_I0
"I think there are several reasons about it."	S_T0
"First, young people could obtain enough information about their decision from advanced technology."	S_M0
"Nowadys the development of those digital devices are prospect, so many people like to make some comment on different website like microblog and the communication among people are improved a lot."	B_S0
"Therefore, if the modern young people need to make a decision, most of them would like to attain more specific message by overview the professional views by strangers, or communicate with other friends who are familliar to this area."	I_S0
"Nevertheless, the children in ancient did not have such devices, so the only thing they could rely on is their parents."	E_S0
"In addtion, the decision of ancient people due to their background."	S_M0
"In ancient times, most of the countries are in the war."	B_S0
"And the most considerate things are food, clothes,water, or life."	I_S0
"So the youth could live better when they accepted their parents advices, because parents have better ability in such areas and they could consider things more rounded."	I_S0
"For example, their parents wanted the children to leave home to another save places, like schools, and ancient kids always comply with their parents."	I_S0
"However, the children nowadays have rights to object with their parents."	E_S0
"Finally, the mind set among ancient children and modern children are diffrent."	S_M0
"Kid in ancient have more conventional mind set, and they thought complying with parents is the obligation for children."	B_S1
"But nowadys, more people recommend the equal status, and more parents are like childrens' friends, they could have argument, own different views."	E_S1
"Whatever, we still depend on our parents to some extent even today."	B_C1
"So we could have a discussion with our parents, their advice is professional and experienced, and absorb from other people' s advice then make"	E_C1
 
"I do not think it is a great idea to just let chlidren make mistakes and learn from them."	S_T0
"Instead of concidering it as lessons from mistakes as most chinese peaple does, I think it hurts the children that suffers from the mistake a lot."	S_T1
"To be simple, I think the benifits is way less than the negative affects it will cost."	S_T0
"First of all , not preventing children from mistakes may cause the lack of happiness and safetiness."	S_M0
"Children's hearts are young and vulnurable."	B_S0
"Unprevented harm like unstopped mistakes may let the child adopt  fear  to the outside world , for it brought him so much unhappiness and horrible memories."	I_S0
"I think it is well against the idea of the development of a healthy mind."	I_S0
"This will cause the Child to be senseative and afraid to think of new ideas , for the ones that make the first step has his fate unknown."	I_S0
"Just imagine it , if someone gets something bad all the time from trying new things and doesn't get any guidance or support, who would ever dare to da anything new?"	E_S0
"In the other hand , it may even cause a negative feeling to the outside world ."	S_M0
"A Child's mind is like a piece of white paper."	B_S0
"What you print on it is what it will look like and what it will become."	I_S0
"The good will be adopted if printed the good and also bad things will occur if bad things are printed."	I_S0
"Giving children a negative feeling to the world at such a young age really sucks because it may easily leave an impression in their mind that tells them that the world doesn't love them."	I_S0
"And as a result, what the child grows up to think about is to hate the world."	I_S0
"Never make chlidren feel they are born in a cruel world."	I_S0
"Make them think of the bright side and let them develop towads it."	E_S0
"But as the wise always say‘every coin has two sides’."	S_M0
"There is benifits of letting children make mistakes."	B_S0
"Firsst , it can teach them to be careful , think before they act."	I_S0
"And it can also make them brave and more able to face future difficultes."	E_S0
"Nothing is perfect , so is the act of preventing or not preventing children from mistakes."	B_C0
"The thing can't really be perfect , but  what we do about it can mean a lot ."	I_C0
"So a balance between preventing too much and absolutely not preventing should be the best option."	I_C0
"It's not good to just prevent such things , but there is obviously no good to not prevent it."	E_C0
 
"The growth of the fast food industry has, without doubt, impacted on the eating habits and the health of many societies around the world."	B_I0
"Diabetes, high cholesterol, heart and respiratory problems are all on the rise due to fatty and sugar-rich food."	E_I0
"However, the question is whether higher tax would improve this situation or not."	S_M1
"From an economic point of view, higher tax might seem sensible."	B_S0
"In countries such as the USA, Australia and Britain, the healthcare system spends a large part of its budget on people with diet-related health problems."	I_S0
"It could be argued that these people have caused their own illnesses because of their choice of food."	I_S0
"In this case, why should they expect the state to pay for their treatment?"	I_S0
"The tax could help fund the healthcare system."	E_S0
"However, we also need to consider which socio-economic group consumes fast food as the main part of their diet."	S_M1
"Statistics indicate that lower income groups eat more of this food than wealthier people."	B_S0
"One possible reason for this is that fast food is far cheaper than fresh produce."	I_S0
"This is because many governments offer large subsidies to farmers who provide products for the fast food industry, such as corn, wheat and beef."	I_S0
"Fruit and vegetables, on the other hand, are not subsidised."	I_S0
"Research suggests that many families simply cannot afford to buy healthy food or pay higher taxes on fast food."	I_S0
"For them, fast food is not a choice but a necessity."	E_S0
"In conclusion, imposing a higher tax on fast food does not seem to be the answer."	S_C2
"If the government chose to do this, it would only lead to greater pov"	O
 
"Notice that many young students are leaving schools with nagative thoughts on studying,I can't help having some further thinking about it."	S_T1
"The first question occur to me is that how this kind of thing happens?"	B_S0
"The answer to it I think may be the two below."	I_S0
"The first one is about the students themslves."	I_S0
"For each lesson,we can't guarantee that all the students understand it well."	I_S0
"So there must be some students who can not catch up with those who have had a good command to the knowledge."	I_S0
"Usually at this point the teachers should come to help,but actually some teachers may treat their students unequally,which contributes to making the gap between the 'good' and 'bad' students deeper."	I_S0
"So the 'bad'   students will feel more and more unconfident and then give up themselves."	I_S0
"Another reason is about the methods of teaching in China."	I_S0
"Most students are forced to learn ,which make them feel bored."	I_S0
"So I think parents and the teachers should give more time to the students to let them have more chances to explore things by themslves."	E_S0
 
"There are more and more voices discussing the issue of garbage collection recently."	S_I0
"There are different views on how to implement this."	B_T0
"Some people think that garbage collection should be guaranteed by legal means."	E_T0
"In my opinion，I think it's not a good measure to set up laws to restrict people's garbage collection."	S_M2
"First of all, the strict requirements and punishment measures of the law can let people recycle garbage to a certain extent."	B_S0
"Although the law of garbage recycling may not improve people's enthusiasm in garbage recycling, at least it will not let people litter, which has certain function for garbage recycling."	I_S0
"However, the legal requirements do not let people know the necessity of garbage collection."	I_S0
"Just as parents force their children to do something, the mandatory legal constraints only force people's behavior, and may even cause resistance to garbage collection."	I_S0
"I think the better way than the law is to restrict the culture, publicize the harm of garbage and the benefits of garbage recycling, construct the social atmosphere of garbage recycling, and let people consciously recycle garbage."	I_S0
"The role of cultural influence is very important and useful."	I_S0
"A successful social atmosphere will enable most people to abide by this social bottom line, so it is a better way to cultivate a good social atmosphere to make people abide by garbage classificationOn this basis, it may be better to set the minimum bottom line of garbage collection law."	E_S0
"In a word, law is a kind of compulsive means, which should not be so abused in daily life."	S_C2
"The construction of a reasonable social atmosphere may be a more effective means"	O

"From 1981 to 2001, the insurance' occupation rised."	B_S0
"Maybe the school has paying more attention to students' safety and health."	I_S0

"The charts show how much a UK school spent on different running costs in three separate years: 1981, 1991 and 2001."	S_I0
"After prioritize the spending parts, we can find the teacher’s salaries are always the biggest percentage overall."	S_M0
"In the first chart: furniture and equipment plus insurance both have a very low percentage."	B_S0
"After 10 years, payment of teachers remains increasing up to its peak."	I_S0
"Furniture & equipment only one third of itself ago."	E_S0
"In the second figure, Resources and insurance start to contain more money, and resources got it’s peak in these 30 years."	S_M0
"Also teacher’s salaries climbed to its top, already half of the total spending (50%)."	S_S2
"Last chart shows that the cost of resources are reduced noticeably."	S_M0
"In the same time cost of insurance saw arising trend, growing from only 2% to 8% by 2001."	S_S2
 
"The chart clearly documents the records of the quantities of goods transported by four kinds of ways from 1974 to 2002 in the UK."	S_I0
"In general, the chart depicts an upward trend in terms of the quantities and the position does not change dramatically in relation to four ways."	S_M2
"Specifically, no matter when it was in 1974 or 2002, the quantities of the goods transported by road ranked the first ,which accounted for 70% in 1974 rising to nearly 100% in2002."	B_S0
"Morever form the 1974 to 1977, during which the quantities of goods transported via rail exceeded those of water,nut in 1978, they both read the same number --40%,espically ,in the following years , there displayed a gentle increase in the quantities of goods transported through water as well as overtook those of rail which showed an up and down tendency."	I_S0
"In addition, the quantities of goods transported by pipeline did not witness much changes showing a continuously steady increase with the highest point was   20% made up the least among the four ways in the four ways in the nearly 27 years."	E_S0

"In recent decades, as the development of medical tecnology medical cares improve a lot."	B_I0
"This thing brings a number of adventages to human beings, such as life expectancy increasing and incurable diseases decreasing."	E_I0
"However it also has several drawbacks."	S_T0
"Despite it, in my oppion, the advantages of this development of medical care outweight the disadvantages."	S_T1
"Firstly, i'd like to talk about the drawbacks of medical care development."	S_M1
"Although the tecnique are mature, few people can acturally enjoy it."	B_S0
"There are a number of medical tecnology are very expensive and few people can afford it."	I_S0
"As the medical care development, the gap between poor and wealthy people will increase."	I_S0
"The inequality could arouse umcoutable social problems, such as famine, struggle even war."	I_S0
"In other ways, the dedvelopmnet of medical care may make us rely on drugs more and even change our species in some degree."	E_S0
"Next, I want to say the worry of preceding part of this aricle is  in vain."	S_M1
"we can make the expensive tecnology suit for poor citizen by some politic, such as medicall allowance and so on."	B_S0
"If we don't improve medical care more and more poor people will dead for no medical care in time."	I_S0
"Meanwile, wealthy people don't care about it in fact."	E_S0
"so The development of medical care in neccery"	S_S2
 
"I thinks it's actually a good and also reasonable thing to pay people in higher place in the company or organisation with higher salary, here are my reasons."	S_T1
"First, people in senior management positions have to take bigger responsbilities and have a lot of things to worry about, like: They have to decide which direction  the company goes, which project to develop or quit, with what other companies to cooperate or not, how to handle the relations with the local goverment, will the annual profit report look decent and if the investors are happy with the stock prices and confident enough to keep investing."	B_S0
"Also, the CEOs, they usually tend to have a higher educational degree and a specialized knowledge in how to managing and operating a company or an organization."	I_S0
"Isn't it normal to grant that kind of people with higher salaries?"	I_S0
"But what I'm agreeing here is a reasonable higher salary, not the kind of salary that the bosses are on the himalayas' top and the workers are on the bottom."	I_S0
"People working in the same place should have a reasonable differentiated salary level range which would be better to make public and transparent, in that way, the employees would feel fair, respected and encouraged thus motivated their working euthusiasm, which would directly benifit the company itself."	I_S0
"This is actually a win-win situation for everyone."	E_S0
 
"As we can see in our daily life, the relatioship bewteen parents and children are complicated, and the reasons may lie in the different conspects of something they think."	S_T0
"Let us discuss the following situation."	S_I0
"If children make some mistakes, should parents forgive them as well as allow them to learn from the mistakes."	S_T1
"Some parents argue that it is human nature to do something wrong at the first time, as they don't clearly understand it and practice before, As the saying goes, there is always the first time, we don't need to worry about what they have done, what truly matters is what they learn from it."	S_M2
"It can be an impressing way for them to broaden their horizons and have a dood command what they shouldn't do."	B_S0
"These parents will give another chance to their childion to correct it and encourage them to face the mistakes objectively."	I_S0
"On the contrary, others suppose that children shouldn't make mistakes, they will make the same mistake again if they made it before."	I_S0
"For instance, smoking, one can hardly get rid of it even if he or she just trys it out of curiosity."	I_S0
"They are strongly against their children doing something wrong."	E_S0
"As far as I am concerned, Parents shoula let children make mistakes."	S_C2
"For"	S_S2
 
"In contemporary society, people are more pay attention to children's educating ways."	S_I0
"And the education is very significant for children to grow up."	S_T1
"And some people believed that parents should give children money if they get a high grade."	B_T0
"I convince that statement is great for children to study and growth."	E_T0
"Firstly, this is a great motivation system for children."	S_M1
"If children can earn some money from parents through they get great grads in school, that will encourage them study better and have aim to do the best."	B_S0
"Taking my uncle' son for a example, firstly his son is not good at study, and always get normal grade or lower grade in class."	I_S0
"And my uncle is worry about, and then he find he need to find something to encourage his son."	I_S0
"And give some motivation for his son."	I_S0
"His son love to playing games and some games will use money, so his son will ask money for him."	I_S0
"And he decided if his son get high grade, he will give some money."	I_S0
"And then his son did it because ha"	E_S0
"Secondly, parents give their children some money and then can help children to study how to manage the money."	S_M1
"That is a wonderful way to help children estabilshe right value of money, and also can impove the relationship with their children."	B_S0
"For instance, when I was young, my parents will give me a little money for prize me get the No.1 in school."	I_S0
"However, I am so young, I didn't know how to use the money."	I_S0
"And then my father told me that I can use the money to do many things, such as buy books, buy some little gifts for grandparents or friends, or save the money into the bank."	I_S0
"From my father's introduce, gradually I can manage my money more science and more grate."	I_S0
"So parents give some to children for prize them can also help them to manage the money."	E_S0
"Admittedly, parents offer some money to children for each high grade they get in school, but also having some problems."	B_C0
"If children always cannot get high grade in school and then they canno get some prize, they will lose heart, and they will not study well."	I_C0
"So sometimes parents need to attention the method to encourge children."	E_C0
 
"It is easily heard in our life that some people say it is good to work for the some organization all the working time , on the contrary, the others have the reverse opinions ."	S_T1
"The people who say it is good to work for the some organization all the working time just want to stay in the same , and they do not want to change."	S_M1
"This kind of people could also be separated into several groups ."	B_S0
"Some are afraid to change , since they can not confirm if they could get a better one or not ,or they just do not want to try something new ."	I_S0
"The others may love their own work very much , in addition ,they  have a strong passion to the work, so they cannot leave it."	E_S0
"As for the people who think that it is better to work for different organisations ,they also have their own thoughts to it."	S_M1
"Trying something new and challenging is always what they like to do , and they say they could also gain a lot of new different feeling from the new environment , which is exactly what they  chase to change."	B_S1
"Also , we know some people just want to have a better group to work with."	E_S1
"I do agree with both of them, only if it is what they love to do"	O
 
"nowadays,if students  learn a foreign language at primary school would be better than secondary school has become a popular discussion."	B_I0
"i think if you want to learn a skill,you would better not keep wait,you should take act right now."	I_I0
"Such as language,when you were young,our brain will be in a state of easy acceptance of information and knowledge."	I_I0
"Meanwhile,language habits and premonition will be better early cultivated."	I_I0
"some experts have done a test."	I_I0
"they put together a student who has been learning English since the fourth grade and a student who has been learning English since the first grade to take the same test."	I_I0
"As a result,the evaluation scores of the students in that first grade are obviously better than those of the other students."	E_I0
"However, add up another subject to let us to learn may bring some pressure to student."	S_T1
"But if you  choose to learn it at secondary,the pressure would not obviously reduced,because the pressure of any skill learning on you is not measured by the time of learning,but its importance to you."	S_M2
"in my opinion,instead of wasting precious golden learning time,it is better to do the most appropriate thing at the most appropriate time."	S_S2
"So,if you want to learn a foreign language nice,you should take action right now,now is not late,but later will be."	S_C2
 
"In the reading,the writer contends that there is several possible which causes the Little Ice Age."	S_I0
"However, the professor in the lecture believes that all of these reasons are out of date."	S_T1
"First, the writer claims that the cooling may have been caused by disrupting of ocean currents."	S_M0
"But the professor challenges the opinion, for the reason that the disruption did exist, but it occurred in the Europe and America."	B_S1
"Maybe it would effect the ocean currents in New Zealand ,whereas, it could not be so widespread that sending a large amount of cold freshwater globally."	E_S1
"Second, the writer asserts that volcanic eruption could have caused the Little Ice Age."	S_M0
"The professor maintains an opposite opinion that the eruption could truely make climate cooler."	B_S0
"However, the cloud sent by volcanoes must bring some appearance, such as the colorful sunlight and snowwhite."	I_S0
"It seemed that there were not any visible appearance."	I_S0
"Therefore, the eruption was not strong enough to cause the cooling."	E_S0
"Finally, the writer states that substantial decreases in human populations may have contributed to the cooling."	S_M0
"The professor believes that, on the contrary of reading,forest trees didnot have enough time to grow on the field."	S_S2
"The population grew and the trees were cut again"	O
 
"Rencently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people: whether success is important, or it is more important to remain happy and optimistic when you fail?"	B_I0
"As far as I am concerned, remaining happy and optimistic is more important."	E_I0
"My points can be elaborate as follows."	S_T1
"To begin with, remaining happy and optimistic can give people constantly motivation to succeed."	S_M2
"To be more specific, no one can always succeed and every one will face failure."	B_S0
"People will have confidence and motivation to succeed again when they fail, if they can remain happy and optimistic."	I_S0
"This is because optimitic and happy will make people think that they have not lose any thing even they failed."	I_S0
"However, if people cannot remain happy and optimistic, they might lose their confidence and motivation to succeed again."	I_S0
"For example, I failed to run for the monitor of my class."	I_S0
"But I remained happy and optimitic because I thought there still some classmates who supported me."	I_S0
"Then I had the motivation to improve myself and tried to run for the monitor next year."	I_S0
"Finally, I became the new monitor."	I_S0
"If I cannot ramain any happy and optimistic, I would not try it again and then I would never be a monitor."	E_S0
"To be followed, remaining happy and optimistic when people fail can easily help people get out of the troubles."	S_C2
"To illustrate, when people failed, what they need to do is to find the way getting out of the trouble."	B_S0
"If they remained happy and optimistic, they will be positive and start to think how to get them out of the troubles."	I_S0
"However, if they cannot remain happy and optimistic, they will be negative and stop thinking anything."	I_S0
"Thus they might always in troubles and they cannot be successful."	E_S0
"For instance, when I failed, I always thought something happy and tried my best to find the way out of the troubl"	O
 
"currently,there has been a growing tendency that free community service should become a compuisory part of high school programms,like working for a charity, teaching sports."	S_T1
"personally , i agree with this view."	S_T0
"To strart with,it is widely accepted that it is beneficial to growth of teenagers if free community service is forced becoming high school programms."	S_M2
"Students could develp a number of good qualities when they free work in communities,such as hospitable,kind and friendly."	B_S1
"therefore,teenagers could gain a excellent social becoming a achievement people."	E_S1
 
"I don't agree with that opinion."	B_T0
"I think the family has more influence on children than the society."	E_T0
"At home, your parents will advise you on your behavior and let you correct it."	S_T1
"When you make mistakes or are affected in the outside world, their obligation will also be to correct you."	S_T0
"First of all, I think the influence of family on children is the most important."	S_M1
"From the birth of a child, every word and deed of a parent will become a model, and the child will learn a lot from it."	B_S0
"Such as , personal character and attitude towards things."	I_S0
"For example, if parents' emotional life is not good, they just quarrel and create conflicts."	I_S0
"When the child sees this scene, his psychology will be greatly affected."	I_S0
"He would think that he lives in an unpeaceful family and doesn't feel happy."	I_S0
"Sometimes parents will vent their emotions to their children."	I_S0
"The child becomes a masochist."	I_S0
"In his mind will form a view that domestic violence is allowed, he can do so in the future."	I_S0
"This has seriously affected his future."	I_S0
"In a living environment, the influence of family is very important, which is related to the child's physiology and psychology as well as the way to recognize and deal with the things."	E_S0
"Another view is that society has a greater impact on children."	S_M1
"Indeed, when children grow up, they spend less time with their parents."	B_S0
"More time is a period of communication with others and self-development."	I_S0
"Friends, teachers, money, time and so on will affect a child's growth."	I_S0
"For example, some children want to have a good watch better than  others."	I_S0
"This shows that children's vanity is developing slowly."	I_S0
"These social influences are inevitable."	I_S0
"But when  the family realizes this problem, they can manage and advise the children from the perspective of the family."	I_S0
"This can help children correct and educate them."	I_S0
"So the problem is solved."	E_S0
"Society will naturally bring great influence to children's growth, but family plays a great role in educating and helping children."	S_C2

"In my view, this kind of life like workers go through one day again and again."	I_I0
"As i grow up, i accidentally see a quesionare which is researching wether workers are more willing to have different kinds of jobs than have the same jobs everyday."	E_I0
"From my prespective, i prefer the first choice."	S_T1
"To begin with, different types of jobs make employees more efficient."	S_M1
"If they have various tasks every single day, they will hold imagination about what kinds of jobs they would do tomorron."	B_S0
"Moreover, they have more motivation to get things down because they had been expected their works since last night."	I_S0
"As a result, they can work efficiently, which is good for the company to become more outstanding."	E_S0
"Second of all, diversity of jobs can decide wether employees can gain enough knowledges."	S_M1
"The workers are assigned to do different jobs all day long, as we all know, it's unavoidable for them to meet different people because they need to exchange ideas with other members."	B_S0
"Through this, the workers can enrich themselves by learing how to see things from diiferent prespectives or developing critical thinking."	I_S0
"Plus."	I_S0
"they may get to know more about others and then improve their interperson relationships."	E_S0
"It's no denying that doing similar tasks during the workday can make workers become specilists of the area."	B_C0
"But nowadays, companies have biger demand for people who can approxiamently handle every fields."	I_C0
"In my view, going to a company where workers have many types of tasks make it easier for adults to find jobs in the future."	E_C0
 
"I am disagree with the following statement."	B_I0

"Such as watching movies and listening music, to relax ourselves."	E_S1
"We can not change the world, but we can change ourselves."	S_M1
"We need to adapt ourselves to this world."	B_S1

"The table gaven illustrates the figures of tourists to Ashdown Museum during the year before and the year after refurbishment."	B_I0
"And the charts below display the result of researchs of tourist satisfaction which they were with their tour during these two periods."	E_I0
"A direct change of the number could be seen in the table that it had increased around twenty thousand visitors when the museum was refurbised."	S_M1
"And what the next chart could show us is that the figure of people who were very satisfied had a huge growth,which is rocket from 15% to 35%."	B_S1
"Which followed is the percentage of people who think satisfied,with a slight rise,from 30% to 40%."	E_S1
"By contrast, the numbers of people who think they were dissatisfied and they were very dissatisfied experienced an obvious  decline，sank from 40% to 15% and from 10% to 5%."	S_M1

"However, in the lecture, the speaker strongly holds that it is possible that Sinosauropteryx is a feathered dinosaur."	S_T1
"First, the author mentions that the fine lines don't represent functional structures."	S_M0
"Instead of this, it may be a residue of decomposition."	B_S0
"However, in the lecture, the lecturer argues that the fine lines cannot represent decomposition because there found no other animals' fossil in the same area."	I_S0
"In addition, because the dinosaur's skin was preserved beautifully, it is possible that the fine lines are feather lines' reservation."	E_S0
"Second, the fine lines might be frill because other similar, relative dinosaurs had."	S_M0
"However, the lecturer states a key point that there is a dramatic chemical difference between feather and frill."	B_S0
"Feather contains a particular protein called beta-keratin, however, frill doesn't have this chemical consistent."	I_S0
"Therefore, it is obvious that the fine lines are feathers rather than frills."	E_S0
"Third, the author states that feather line for this dinosaur is useless because the fine lines are found on their backbone, which cannot help fly or regulate body temperature."	S_M0
"However, the lecturer objects by raising other functions like display function."	B_S1
"Like some birds using colorful tail feathers to attract mate, Sinosauropteryx attracts mates by its orange and white colorful feathers on its backbone and tail."	E_S1
 
"With the quickening pace of people's life, more and more people like fast food."	S_T1
"Fast food is economical and convenient."	B_S0
"It is the best choice for people who are busy at work."	I_S0
"But should we tax fast food more?"	I_S0
"I think so."	I_S0
"Although fast food has many advantages, such as cheap, quick construction and so on, it also has many harms."	I_S0
"The quality of a lot of fast food is not up to standard, in order to seek the biggest profit, businesses reduce the cost of raw materials, the use of inferior food materials, seasoning."	I_S0
"The final harm is to the health of consumers."	I_S0
"To take an example, instant noodles."	I_S0
"This is one of our most familiar fast food, and we often eat them, but easy to face our body has enormous harm, excessive food additives, carcinogens, etc., although it is very cheap, very attract people to buy it, and eat it, but we want to know the dangers of it, especially for young people to the dangers of the most deadly."	I_S0
"The production of a large number of fast food, the damage to the environment is also very serious, a large number of plastic products, kitchen waste harm our living environment, global warming, ozone hole and so on."	I_S0
"So I'm in favor of more taxes on fast food, which would reduce the amount of fast food people use, reduce the demand for fast food, and protect people's health."	E_S0

"for example, learning another language need the ability to distinguish the detail of every language，and this biases can influent your judge."	I_S0
"So people who speaking two language will more confident for their deecision."	E_S0
 
"Some people argue that travel and work are the only reason to master a foreign language."	S_I0
"In my opinion, there are also various reasons for us to learn a foreign language apart from traveling and working."	S_T0
"Mastering other languages means that we can get to know other regions' culture as well."	S_M1
"When learning foreign languages, we will have desire to know the people or the habits in that continents."	B_S0
"Therefore, we can expand our knowledge and broaden our horizens."	I_S0

"Besides, it is true that learning something new can activate and exercise our brain and make it more energetic, therefore, it can benefit us a lot in return when we learn other things in the future."	I_S0
"Also, it can practice our memory skills since we have to remember new vocabulary and grammar."	E_S0
"On the other hand, working and traveling are indeed the essential factors for us to study foreign language."	S_M1
"Traveling abroad means we have to communicate with others in local language, otherwise, we can not express our feelings correctly, which is very troublesome in a unfamiliar country."	B_S0
"Similarly, in the business trade, especially the cross-national trade, it is extremely necessary to master a second language so that it can be possible to share our thoughts clearly."	I_S0
"Learning other countries languages is of great benefit in the working place."	I_S0
"It may be a strong advantage for further promotion while others do not have this skill and it provides you with more opportunity."	E_S0
"In summary, there are numerous reasons for us to study a foreign language, instead of just for travel or work."	S_C2

"Sitting by the TV or computer for a long time can make them short-sighted."	E_I0
"It can even make them stoop."	S_T0
"The second I want to say is that some contents in TV programs and movies are not suitable for young people, especially students."	S_M2
"For example,some romantic scenes on TV and in movies can make students think  
of  looking for a mate."	B_S0

"Country provide scientists a stable job and this is also a main reason why parents sent their children to colleages."	I_S0
"However, they ignore a fact that some children may not interested in science and are forced to do so."	I_S0
"In this case, students cannot make effort into researchs and study which is a distory to science industry."	I_S0
"Many students point out that they want to choose subject base on their preference, so do I."	I_S0
"First of all, muli-subjects can develop a students skills in all rounded way."	I_S0
"Different courses give brand new angles of the world and borden their horizon directly or indirectly."	I_S0

"It's believed that stimulating the increasing of economic is regarded as the most essential goal of the government,while there are other people who hold the opinion that many other affairs are worth paying equal attention to."	S_T1
"Obviously,the development of economic is of great significant for the reason that it can represent the ability of producing and consuming of the people in the country,which means that the authority must attach great to."	B_S0
"For example,more positions as well as job opportunities should be created and the incomes of the residents in our country need to be increased,which enables them to afford more things they could not buy in the past,therefore their living conditions have been improved considerablely."	I_S0
"Without the rise of economy,people may feel unsatisfied with their state quo."	I_S0
"On the other hand,it is suggested that emphases should be placed on the improvement of some other fields,such as the public services and healthcare."	I_S0
"Moreover,education and the construct of infrastructures should be taken into consideration because they have tangiable benefits to people's quality of life."	I_S0
"For example,it is more convenient for people to travelled around in the city if public transportations are advanced."	I_S0
"Personally,I tend to agree with the former view for the reason that the stable development of economy can bring other flourishings,without which no public facilities or services can be provided to the people."	I_S0
"To draw a conclusion,the government should concentrate on both the progress of economy and other kinds of services or facilities."	E_S0
 
"With the growing development of tourism, there is a inescapable question for the government to settle: whether the financial support should be given to draw more attention from the tourists to promote the tourism."	B_I0
"Some people state government should raise the safety of the city by hiring more police."	I_I0
"Others think the appearance of the old infrastucture should be improven as well."	I_I0
"I agree and insist that only when the city's saftey is ensured and the appearance is embellished can more tourists be drawn there."	I_I0
"Here come my statements."	E_I0
"Firstly, the a safer  environment establishes a good reputation for the city and naturally attract more people to come."	S_M2
"When people decide where to spend their vocation, the fist and foremost element is the safety there."	B_S0
"People have felt lacked of safety when they are far away from home."	I_S0
"Therefore, they cannot persvade themselve to choose a pooly safe place to have their enjoyable holiday."	I_S0
"Also, a dangerous city  shows the unqualified development, which may indicate the lacking in service and shallow people here."	I_S0
"People tend to make use of their vacation to get relaxed and let themselves temporarily forgot the troubles they are in when ordinarily at work."	I_S0
"Obviously, they are not willing to get into more troubles when experiening the holiday."	I_S0
"Take myself for example."	I_S0
"When I choose where to go in summer vacation, regularly I avoid visiting unsafe cities because I know my parents won't allow me to travel alone, which is too dangerous to go individually in such disordered enviroment."	I_S0
"Of course They won't visit there themselves as well."	I_S0
"For a city, the most powerful period of attracting people is in students' holiday."	I_S0
"Therefore, I suggest the city should hire more police to make sure a safe envrionment."	E_S0
"Moreover, improving the apperance of the city is also an efficient method of drawing attraction from others."	B_C1

"As far as iam concerned,I think it not is a good idea tooffer children money for their grade."	S_I0
"In order to help children to make greater progress in their study ,parents should gradually give up this way."	S_T0
"From a short term angle,children seem to behave better in their study and get a higher grade ,but studying is not just test and high grades."	S_M1
"Giving money as prize create a link between high grades and rewards  ,which make children study for grades and money ,but not improving themselves."	B_S0
"Studying will be treated as a mission for money they can get but not a stair for better life,job ,wedding and future."	I_S0
"Once parents stop this,children will lose their energy of studying."	I_S0
"So this way is not a good solution to solve the problem,and it might make the problem even worse."	E_S0
"From a long term angle,I  believe that parents do this for the sake of helping children to create interest or even fall in love with studying."	S_M1
"As the old saying goes,keep learning until you die."	B_S1
"They want their children to keep improving themselves to live a better life and overcome the challenges of society."	E_S1
 
"Tremendously impressed by the topic,as far as I am concened,I am totoally agree with this opinion."	B_I0
"Here are my reasons."	I_I0
"Nowadays,high grade means that you have a strong oppunity to achieve yourself."	I_I0
"Grades have already consist of a majority of life for children."	I_I0
"Higher grades refer to more colorful future."	I_I0
"On no account for igorning the significant of high grade."	I_I0
"In terms of recent education system,it is grade-centered."	E_I0
"According to the system,every school-age child is pushing for the high grade."	S_T1
"There is no doubt that this kind of stuff is able to spur the children's motivation to get high grades."	S_M1
"It has a obvios good effect."	B_S0
"For instance,if parents don't give pocket money to children as a gift,the children will pay no attention to study."	I_S0
"Because the school-age children are too young to realize the importance of study."	I_S0
"They may as well addicited into watching Tv,playing video games or somethings like these."	I_S0
"Offering them money is a approach to throw a light on what they should do."	I_S0
"So why not offer money for your children to let them spare no effort on their study?"	E_S0
"In my personal view,this is not only do a favor for the children,but also have a positive influence on the parents."	S_M1
"Parents are supposed to be content with the children's high mark,and be proud of their children as well."	B_S0
"In this case,offering money is able to develop the mutural understanding between parents and their children."	I_S0
"Through this slight behavior,the whole famliy will lead a more delight life."	I_S0
"With this way,parents will no more argue with children for the poor grade."	E_S0
"Above all,offering school-age children money for each high grade they get in school is definitely a good idea."	B_C1
"I hold a agreement with these parents."	E_C1
 
"Many concerned about social skills in dealing with friendship."	B_I0
"some people think that the abillity to maintain friendships with  a small number of people last a long period of time is more important for happiness than  the abllility to make many new friends easily."	I_I0
"however , i hold the oppsite persipective, i think maintaining friendship with a small number of people over a long period of time is requsted more patience , feelings, social skills."	E_I0
"however, making new friends does not need these."	S_T0
"firstly,during long period of  maintaining friendships ,you maybe have conficts with your firends sometimes, because you are faimilar with each other, you  konw what they like and want they dislike."	S_M2
"so in the conficts,it is easier to hurt your frineds' feeling."	B_S0
"that we called that we  need more patient to maintain this freindship."	I_S0
"in addtion, if  you have some unhappy things with your new friends and they are not impotant to you."	I_S0
"i think that does not matter."	I_S0
"Bacause you cann not need to care about their feeling and  can just  make anthoer new friends."	I_S0
"i think that's easier for me to do so."	E_S0
"in conclusion,the abillity to maintain friendships with  a small number of people last a long period of time is more important for happiness than  the abllility to make many new friends easily."	S_C2

"It is easy to notice that an increasing number of people learn at least a foreign language and apply them in daily life, for exmple when traveling to other countries or using at workplace."	S_I0
"However, i believe that learning other languages will also contribute to our basic skills, like communication skill, reading skill."	S_T1
"Globalization has been main trendency current years."	S_M1
"It is the fact that people have more access to exotic commodity as international marketing has opening to most countries, which means that people who master other languages could understand the illustration or explanation of  imported goods and then get more fresh experiences in daily life."	S_S2

"The lecture and the reading discuss whether the bees exist on earth as early as 200million years ago."	B_I0
"The lecturer puts forward 3 points and effectively contradicts the opinions of the reading."	E_I0
"First of all, the reading says that no foosils of actual bees have been found."	S_M1
"The earliest preserved body of bee is 100 million years old."	B_S0
"In contrast, the lecture claims that no fossil doesn't mean bees not exist 200 million years old."	I_S0
"Without the tree the fossil couldn't compose."	I_S0
"So may trees are rare in that period."	I_S0
"That is the reason why we can't find any foosil of bees 200 million years ago."	I_S0
"By this way, the lecture contradicts the first opinion of the reading."	E_S0
"Second, ,the reading claims that there are no flowering plants which are the food for bees."	S_M1
"While, according to the lecture, this is not the case."	B_S0
"The lecturer says that bees may feed any other plants."	I_S0
"In that period, bees may not have reationship with flowering plants, the biological relationship could be built after flowering plants appaered."	E_S0
"Finally, the reading states that the structure which been found lack some details of bees."	B_C0
"While the lecture claims that there are other clues support the existence of bees such as chemical material."	I_C0
"The chemcial composition of bees is distinct from others ."	I_C0
"The morden technology give an evidence that what we found turn out to have a connection with bees."	I_C0
"Thus the lecture refutes that last claim of the reading."	E_C0
 
"There is a increasing trend that parents are willing to award their school-aged children with money if they get a high mark."	B_I0
"Parents are in favor of this idea for it effectively encourage student to study."	E_I0
"But I insisit that this is not a good idea."	S_T0
"The award money will not serve as a stimulus for study, instead, it distract children from study."	S_M1
"They no longer study for their interest or their eager to learn knowledge, and they just focus on money."	B_S0
"This behavior changes their aim of study, from learning to gaining money."	I_S0
"This money awarding betray the esece of spiritual education."	I_S0
"For example, the money award may encourage the students interest in spending money and take earning money as their goal of learning."	I_S0
"The better solution is to give children books instead to encourage them explore the unknowns."	E_S0
"What the parents should award is not only the hgh grade,but also the progress."	S_M1
"Parents should not only demand high mark,but also prase for the progress children made."	B_S0
"For instance, if a student has a poor mark at beginning and  make progress through dignant efforts,but he failed to get reward for hard to meet the high standard parents want,he would cetainly lose heart to study."	I_S0
"This is not the parents want,but is caused by parents award."	I_S0
"So it is better for the parents to offer money for each progress children made in school instead of the high grade."	I_S0
"This is what  many top universities are managing to do now."	E_S0
"In summary, offering money for each high grade, to some extent, will encourage children to study harder."	B_C0
"But to think about the deeper influnce, this is not a good idea for it actually kill the interest of learning."	I_C0
"I prefer a better solution that parents could reward children for the progress they made at school and change the money into the book."	I_C0
"This will be a better stimulus for study."	E_C0
 
"In the reading, the writer claims the building how used that there are three competing theories."	S_I0
"However, the professor in the lecture refutes the reasons presented by the reading, and he believes that the building has living and religious."	S_T1
"First, the reading argues that  the building is purely residential and can accommodate hundreds of people."	S_M0
"Explained as the early version of architecture in modern southwest society and the houses bear a striking resemblance to the famous large apartment buildings in taos, new Mexico, where many people have lived for centuries."	B_S1
"Yet the listening thinks its It can't hold so many people."	E_S1
"Second, the writer contends that buildings are used to store food."	S_M0
"One of their main crops is grain and corn, which can be stored for a long time and used for a long time."	B_S0
"The corn supply has to be in one place, and the size of these big houses makes them perfect for that purpose."	I_S0
"Quite the opposite, the professor mentions that  It can't be used to store food in large quantities."	E_S0
"Third, the reading holds that the house was used as a ceremonial center."	S_M0
"At the ceremonies, they ate festive meals and then discarded the pots in which the meals had been prepared or served."	B_S1
"On the contrary, the professor points out the people only"	E_S1

"And  everyday after ten o’clock in the evening, the TV does not have channels."	I_S0
"With the development of economy and society,TV have so many channels."	I_S0
"People has more and more choices,children can choose Children’s program,Women can choose TV drama,Men can choose Football match."	I_S0
"Everybody have a choice."	I_S0
"and the channels palys all day,even if in the twelve o’clock in the evening,the TV also have good programs."	I_S0
"But in the hundred of TV channels,I usually watch a few."	I_S0
"Because there are only a few channels have good TV play."	I_S0
"There have some poor quality TV program."	I_S0
"Make a TV show became easier."	I_S0
"Actually,lots of channels won’t be choosed."	I_S0
"Sounds like Cooking channel,Shopping channel."	I_S0
"There are not a lot of really meaningful programs,The TV shows are getting more,but not good."	I_S0
"And the TV advertising is so much."	I_S0
"It has some disadvantage to old people and young children."	I_S0
"More TV channels have advantage and disadvantage,The 
 advantage is people having choices,we can choose a favorite show."	I_S0
"But the disadvantage is TV channels is too much,brings some poor quality tv program."	I_S0
"If TV programs make better in the future,every TV channels can make meaningful and interesting,I think it will be more people watching TV."	E_S0
 
"With the development of education，increasly parents want their children to have a better educatiom."	B_I0
"Whether ask the goverment to bear the cost of higher education or pay tuition fees by students has been a heated discussion."	E_I0
"I personally think students should pay the fees themselves."	B_T1
"Asking the goverment to bear the cost may negatively influnce many parts of the society."	E_T1
"One reason the higher education cost lots of money for this money can construct many parts of society,such as medical treatment,the development of economy."	B_S1
"The second reason is that if need more money，there need to have more teacher，so many"	E_S1
"Students have different need of education."	S_M2
"For one thing,the students have been guarenteed the basic education by government，and there are many different extra classes,such as drawing and daning,some students think these class are useful while others think controvisally."	B_S0
"In this case,too much money from the goverment is wasted."	I_S0
"For another,some students do not have to pay the tuition fees because their study is really fantastic."	I_S0
"For example,the students from the school which have the teacher can provide higher education in normal teaching,and they do not to have extra tuition."	I_S0
"In conclusion,i think students should pay tuition fees themselves for the goverment need more money to change the society to a better one and the varition need of different students."	E_S0
 
"Nowadays,there has ben a growing concern about whether more TV programs can be benifit for audience."	S_T1
"Some people believe that providng more options will be better while others argue that too many of them may have an adverse effect on the quality."	B_S0
"In my opinon,both of them have pros and cons."	I_S0
"It is true that there are a host of benefits to give people more choices."	I_S0
"With the development of social economy,the increasng demand for entertainment cannot be ignored."	I_S0
"On the one hand,after a long-day work,feeling tired,people want to refresh themselves,so watching TV can be a good way for them to relax."	I_S0
"Talk shows,TV drama,sports games..."	I_S0
"different kinds of programs will fufil various requirement."	I_S0
"On the other hand,it will provide large amounts of job positons,such as hosts,directors and stuff like that,which can raise the living standards of people and promote the development of national entertainment."	I_S0
"However,it is undeniable that the negative impact on too many TV channels is also evident."	I_S0
"First,lots of same content will appear,making us feel boring to look at them over and over again."	I_S0
"To illustrate,there are several singing competitions on TV now,they are just called similar names."	I_S0
"What is more,it is tough for governments to cover all of them,which will cause some bad situatons,like vulgar content."	I_S0

"When it comes to the issue whether parents should point out rhe mistakes of their children or not, different people have different interpretations of issue."	B_T1
"Some hold the idear that letting children make mistakes will induce unnecessary losses, however, on the personal level, I believe that there are some advantages if parents let their chilfren make mistakes."	E_T1

"I think this statement is true but there may be other reasons for the traffic jam in many cities."	E_I0
"The increase of car ownership has cause the number of cars in the street to increase, thus making it more congested for drivers to drive in the street."	S_M0
"At peak time in the day, numerous cars might cause traffic congestion, especially in the center of the city where many people have to commute."	S_S2
"However, the traffic jam could have been better organized if more precise and accurate traffic rules were carried out."	S_M0
"Sometimes the seemingly serious traffic jam may be avoided if drivers obey the traffic rules correctly and treat each other with politeness."	S_S2
"To settle this problem, the government should impose a restriction on the number of cars in the street, and during peak time, policemen ought to stand at the crossroads to help solve the problem."	S_M0
"Also, public transportation system ought to play a significant role in intercity transportation, such as buses, subways or coaches."	B_S1
"It is the public transportation that contributes a great deal to reducing the number of cars in the street."	E_S1

"The two maps describe the difference of the rod access to a city hospital between that in 2007 and that in 2010."	S_I0
"Foremost, looking at the map of 2007, a city hospital which looked like an rectangular was situated in the north of the map and be surrounded by the Ring Road."	S_M2
"City Road was at the south part of the map and there was a Hospital Road which met with Ring Road and City road at right angles."	B_S0
"And the car park which allowed both staff and public in could be seen at the right hand of the Hospital Road."	I_S0
"And then, moving on to the map of 2010, one of the most obvious difference was that there were two roundabouts appearing at the junctions of Ring Road and Hispital Road, City Road and Hispital Road respectively."	I_S0
"Besides, a bus station was set up at the left hand of Hispital Road which is accessible from two roundabouts."	I_S0

"Do you think that the modern young people should have the ability to plan and organize?"	S_I0
"Some people agree with this idea, because this ability is very important for these young people."	B_T0
"However, others give a different opinion."	E_T0
"Different people hold different ideas."	S_T1
"As for me, I agree with the latter one."	S_T0
"My reasons and details are listed as follows."	S_T1
"First of all, every lifes always are very complex, not only the modern life."	S_M1
"It is not hard to understand."	B_S0
"Around 1990, my parents were very young, too, and they faced much more complex society than today's young people face."	I_S0
"Because in China, the young people at that time needed to accept the traditional ideas and understand a lot of foreign knowledge, and how to adjust this knowledge is very important."	I_S0
"For example, electronic devices or jazz dance were popular for young people, but their parents didn't like them, because of the traditional thinking, which even caused a series of social problems."	I_S0
"But nowadays young people don't have this kind of problem because our parents have more open-minded."	E_S0
"Secondly, the ability to plan and organize is not necessary for young people in modern society."	S_M1
"Because with the progress of science and technology and the change of working styles, the young people who have no ability to organize will do other jobs, and they will not be discriminated against for not having this ability."	B_S0
"I can explain this in terms of sports."	I_S0
"The old soccer stars have more leadering, that is organized, like the Maradona or Maldini."	I_S0
"They are good playmakers and leaders on and off the court."	I_S0
"But today's young footballers rarely do, such as Pogba or Rashford."	I_S0
"They are very famous, but they are not as well organized, but they can do a good job in their field, which is enough."	E_S0
"Of course, being organised is a good thing."	B_C0
"Because it is very helpful for young people to make friends and even find jobs."	I_C0
"But, let's face it, being organized is not so important in modern times."	I_C0
"Because we have more choices, we can use more of our own ideas."	E_C0
 
"Nowadays, more and more youngesters  have opportunities to get into the universties, no matter where they came from what is their economic strength."	S_I0
"Many people consider that entering the universties should be fair, which means everyone can get in it."	B_T0
"From where I  stand,I completely agree with the  statement that college should make it easy for students who afe poor and live in rural area to enter the universies."	E_T0
"If everyone have the same chances to access the universities, including those from suburbs or vey poor, there will be more students resources, which means more people can help develop the world."	S_M1
"For example, when I was in college there were only about 50 scholars in my major  who could devote outselves in promoting the bright future of the field."	B_S1
"Comparing wih the latest data in my school, over 100 students are there studying in that major, which represents the people with capability in the major can help and guide more in the area."	E_S1
"Another reason why it is pretty necessary is the more students are there in the universties, the more ideas they will think of."	S_M1
"Not only in innovating new facilities or something, consummating the old's thoughts is also important ."	B_S0
"for instance, in ancient China before the college appeared, the only way to get advanced or new things is to think by yourselves, which was really a hardship."	I_S0
"Even in completing   the theary already wrote, it was hard for you to discuss or even chack it."	I_S0
"however, after the initating of universties, scholars from everywhere came to a place and debating, dicussing and talking about their own thoughts or point of view, by which they facilitated many advanced thoughts and creations such as compass and Lun YU a book fullfilled with warious of spitits."	E_S0
"In conclusion,  not allowing those poor people and people from distant places can to some extant ebable people to select talents, however, doing this lower the probability for human being t get a huge step forward in the long history."	B_C1
"Thus, I completely approve the opinion that universty should make it eaier for students from remoted area and with poor family circumstance  to acess the universty  education."	E_C1
 
"Some think that it is all governments' reponsibility to tackle with the recycling work."	S_I0
"It seems good, since goverments master all the things in our daily life."	B_T1
"However, from my perspective, it is not realistic for governments to tackle with this job solely."	E_T1
"In our minds, governemts are the leader and decider."	S_M2
"For example, they will decide when to repair a road or rebuild a tower."	S_S2
"So in our steorotype, they"	O
 
"In today social, most people spend most of their adult life at work."	S_I0
"some people think that job satisfaction is a very important reason of personal happiness."	S_T0
"for how to Improve job satisfaction."	S_M2
"first of all, we need to find a job that we like and interested in the job, which is very important."	B_S0
"because if you got a job,but you don't like it,maybe you can't focus attention on the job."	I_S0
"besides, I think attitude is also very important, when you  face to your diffculty work,try to ues a positive attitude,believe  you can do it as well."	I_S0
"finally, I think promote work skills are also very important, that you can enjoy your work."	E_S0
"on the other hand ,even if in your favorite job, you may not get satisfacation,it's maybe due to the work too difficulty or feeling tired from too much work."	S_C2
 
"The two maps illustrate how the road which accessed to a city hospital changed in 2007 and in 2010."	S_I0

"There were six bus stops next to the hospital road, three in the left side, three in the right side."	B_S0
"Besides, the city road interacted with hospital road."	I_S0
"The car park which were staff and public was next to the right side of bus stops,moreover, it was upon the city road and under the city hospital."	E_S0
"In 2010, there were many changes, the first was that there were two new roundabouts built, one was in the front of city hospital, and the other one was the point which hospital road interacted with city road."	S_M1
"The hospital road was in the middle of these two roundabouts."	B_S0
"The second was that the car park was divided in two parts individually, the public car park was next to the right side of city hospital, but the staff car park still right here."	I_S0
"The third, the six bus stops were removed, but it built a new big bus station in the left side of hospital road, and there were two fresh roads were built outside the bus station, connecting with two roundabouts."	E_S0
"All in all, in 2007,there was just simple facilities near the city hospital, but in 2010, there were many new roads or facilities built, and it became more modern."	S_C2

"Firstly, as recycling waste has been projected as optional, many people and even big firms tend to overlook the importance of such process and simply proceed to dump garbage carelessly."	I_S0
"By imposing harsh penalties, I believe that such indifferent attitude will change for the better."	I_S0
"Secondly, the money generated from fining those who violate the rules can be used as funds allocated for green campaigns to further encourage people to recycle whenever possible."	I_S0
"The combination of two measures, in the long term, can make people more careful in their handling with household trash."	I_S0

"With the current shortage of personnel for informing these people, relying solely on financial punishment to force them can put them in a precarious position and cause social conflicts."	I_S0
"For that reason, I believe that education should be placed at the heart of the efforts to raise awareness of benefit of recycling."	I_S0
"For instance, teachers should teach children to put inorganic waste in recycling bins."	I_S0
"As children are the future of humanity, this platform can lead to a radical change in the current throwaway society that people are living in."	I_S0

"First, there do have a settlement in Canada from Norse,who came from Europe and use this kinds of silver coin as a currency,but its too far between Maine to eastern Canada."	E_T1
"Second, there's no other coins found, which shows that the Norse may not bring any silver coins with them."	B_S0

"Nowadays some parents offer their school-age children for each high grade they get in school."	S_I0
"I do not think it woukd be a good idea for the following reasons."	S_T0
"First and foremost, using money to stimulate child to learn might do harm to his learning habits."	S_T1
"As is generally acknowledged, learning is one of the elementary thing for every school-age child, and thus it is of vital importance to for a child to develop a good learning habit."	B_S1
"If learing is strongly connected with money, they may not be able to concentrate on learning and may focus on the monely solely, which means that the purpose of their learning may be directed to a wrong direction."	E_S1
"Second, money may lead to envy among the children."	S_M0
"For some children with poor grades and strong desire for money, it may finally result in their cheating in the exam."	B_S0
"And for those with good grades, they may be isolated and hated by others for the envy for the money they have."	I_S0
"It also increases the chance that they are bullied for money."	E_S0
"Last but not the least, the effect of encouragement to children may soon wear out after several times of , and the children may desire for more."	S_M0
"And once such desire is developed, it would be hard to wipe the influence off from a child."	B_S1
"It is dangerous to make a child too desirable for something that is normally used in the world of adults."	E_S1
"Some supporting the method may argue that money is a good encouragement to children with good grades, however we should recognize that exposing children to money too early may not be such a good thing."	S_M0

"Opinions vary from person to person."	I_I0
"Some claim that teachers should not be paid as much as other well-paid jobs."	E_I0
"Nevertheless, controry to their views comes to my perspective, it is teachers that should be treated better, especially when the following reasons are mentioned."	S_T0
"To begin with, paying more salary to the teachers can make them do more contributions to the society."	S_M1
"It is largely due to thte fact that teachers can transmit many knowledge and their experiences to the students."	B_S0
"If the teachers have good  salary, Thus teachers would more hardworking, so the students can be developed very quickly, resulting in the fact that they play very significat roles in the diverse areas."	I_S0
"By contrast, if the teachers have less salary, they have to make money from other places to live, which would probably result in the fact that the teachers were distracted."	I_S0
"How could teachers' teaching quality get guaranteed if their basic needs cannot get ensure?"	I_S0
"For example, my uncle Jack used to work in a town school, which pay less salary."	I_S0
"In the modern society, his salary is only 3000 yuan a month, which force him to do some part-time job to make money like a housing teacher."	I_S0
"In this case, he cannot concentrate his attention to the students, thus his students cannot learn many konwledge from him."	I_S0
"Consequently, many students cannot be experts in many areas."	E_S0
"On top of that, paying more salary to teachers can make them be more well-informed."	S_M1
"The primary reason for this is that if the teachers have a good salary, they could have chance to do some experiments or get accessed to the soces of the studying reasoures, they would be more wise, then them can cultivate students instead of a test-driven education."	B_S0
"For example, my dad is a high school teacher, who teach in a private school."	I_S0
"The school have huge budget for the salary and the researchers."	I_S0
"So dad can get access to al"	E_S0
"To put in a nutshell, I reckon that teacher should be paid as much as other jobs like doctors, lawyers or business leaders."	S_C2
 
"As the society developing, increasing number of parents attach great improtance to the study of their children."	B_I0
"It takes most time for students to study on campus."	I_I0
"So there are two group person who may has most influence for them, their friends and teachers."	I_I0
"Some people believe that friends has most influence for students because they have many common topic."	E_I0
"But I think teachers influence more than their peers."	S_T0
"Above all, teachers play a more influent role in students life because they are more experienced."	S_M2
"Compared with friends, the teacher experience more."	B_S0
"And They can give many sophisticated insights into the industry."	I_S0
"Their interpersonal network can help students to find a decent job."	I_S0

"Different people hold different perspectives."	B_S0
"Therefore, it is a controversial and complex issue."	I_S0
"I will analyze it from both aspects."	I_S0
"Admittedly, buying a range of household goods will bring people more convenience and help people to indicate their social status."	I_S0
"On the one hand, we can use these household goods such as microwaves and rice cookers instead of original cookers that need fires to cook, which will be more environmental friendly and save a lot of natural resources as well as saving people's valuable time."	I_S0
"On the other hand, it is a kind of indication of people's living level."	I_S0
"Not every family has a whole type of electronic household goods which indicates the modernization of a new life."	I_S0
"So, it is positive to buy a range of household goods."	I_S0
"Nevertheless, buying a range of household goods will bring people some potential danger and affect people's normal life."	I_S0
"For one thing, most household goods we bought today are electronic, which will cause some electronic accidents if we can't properly use them."	I_S0
"For another, it is inevitable that some household goods such as microwaves and water boiler will make some noises when they are put to use, which will affect people's physical and psychological health."	I_S0
"Therefore, in some way, we can say that buying a range of household goods also has its negative sides."	I_S0
"Ultimately, from what I have discussed above, it is obvious to demonstrate that buying a range of household goods both has its positive and negative aspects."	I_S0
"What's the best for us is to purchase  household goods in appropriately number and use them carefully and properly."	I_S0
"Only in this way can we actually enjoy the merits modern and high-tech household goods bring to us."	E_S0

"So in our daily life, more and more people choose to chat with others through theses APPs other than some traditional ways like meeting in person."	B_T0
"So in one hand, we can communicate and keep in touch with others more conveniently."	E_T0
"In other hand, now the relationships between some people are not as deep as before, since there is no need and chance to meet each other,which is not beneficial to develop close relationships."	B_T1
"What is more, sometimes we contact with some people just because of work affairs,not in terms of personal relationships."	E_T1
"Actually, these new interacting types make our life more convenient and it takes us less time to keep in touch with others."	S_M2
"However, I do not think it is a positive trend."	B_S0
"Now we pay more attention on connections with people online, but sometimes ignore our families or friends in real life."	I_S0
"For example, when I gather with my friends, some of them would chat with others  by cellphone now and then, which makes me a little upset."	I_S0
"What is worse, spending too much time being concentrating on online things is bad for our studies or work, even our health."	E_S0

"People hold different views about the functions of acquiring a secondary language."	S_T1

"Another merit is that understanding a foreign language could contribute to work efficiently."	I_S0
"This means that dwellers who know the language in their workplace could deal with the documents and assignments more quickly."	I_S0
"However, there are more reasons for citizens to learn a foreign language."	I_S0
"Primarily, this skill could be beneficial to learn local culture, especially by reading local books, watching the documentaries and so on, leading to enrich individuals' knowledge and broaden their visions."	I_S0
"In addition, people might have a wider range of resources for information, resulting in the progress of work or study."	I_S0
"A good example for this is that students could find foreign essays, news and professional comments helpful to get more information related to their education, understanding their major better and gaining excellent grades."	I_S0
"In conclusion, although the skill of a foreign language could develop citizens' communication skills and work efficiency, I still think that there are more reasons for acquiring this skill, such as learning culture and more resources."	E_S0

"What's more, the time announced results of test made him headache very much, he told in person 'it is the most dull and dark time I experience in my life, I hate to be compared with outhers who are better than me'."	I_S0
"Studying should have been an enthusiastic thing which makes students dig out their potention and surpass themselves."	I_S0
"However, thanks to the exam-oriented education ,they have no option whereas to study in a dull way."	I_S0

"Hence we could see that ,improving our type of teaching may improve the circumstance of studying for students."	I_S0

"first of all,communication with people from different countries with only few language can make life easier ."	S_M0
"especially for the people who like travel around the word,they only need to study fewer languages ,but they can speak with the locals and easier to understand the special culture ."	B_S0
"the same is true for those who need to engage in international commercial cooperation,when verbal communication is no longer a barrier,they can work more efficient."	I_S0
"so ,if you use fewer voices but can speak with more people in more countries,it will save you time to learn more languages and do something else ."	E_S0
"what,s more,as language becomes easier to communicate,information become easier to obtain."	S_M0
"most people can get more and more information from all around the word ."	S_S2
"on the contrast,language is an important part of culture,it represent the sense of belonging of people in each country to their own history and ancestors,."	S_M0
"and different sounds make the world more colorful and diverse."	S_S2
"so,from my point of view,to make our world develop more efficiently,to bring people closer together,we can speak the same language as much as possible."	B_C1

"Between 1980 and 2008, a fluctuant rise concerning the petrol and oil can be seen ,taking up  
most consumption, with about 35 quadrillion in 1980 and 42 quadrillion in 2008."	E_I0
"It is predicted that there will be a steady growth tendency about the usage,  increasing to 47 quardillion in 2030."	S_T0
"From 1980 to 2013, the consumption of natural gas and coal have similar upward ternd and both are 24 quadrillion in 2013 while in 1980 natural gas was 4 quadrillion more than coal."	S_M1
"By predicting, there will be a huge gap between  them, the coal will rise to 30 quadrillion, in the meanwhile natural gas will be stable at 24 quadrillion."	S_S2
"With respect to nuclear、solar/wind and hydropower they were almost equal from 1980 to 1986, which were 4 quadrillion."	S_M1

"There are an increasing number of people who have their own cars."	B_I0
"Some people claims that following the increasement of car ownership, the problem of traffic jam has became more and more severe in many cities  in the past thirty years."	E_I0
"In this essay,  I will give reasons about why I am of this point of view before proposing some effective actions that can be taken by governments to discourge people from using their cars."	O
"Many cities are indeed trapped into a situation that they are becoming 'one big traffic jam' mainly because the increasement of car ownership."	S_M1
"For one thing, when the process of urbanization became more and more quickly in the past thirty years, an increasing number of people settled down in cities which forced cities to be expanded."	B_S0
"For this reason, it was neccesary for residents especially for commuters who needed to commute between their houses to their working places to have their own cars."	I_S0
"For another, many families could afford to buy at least two cars, for example, one for commuting in the city and another for travelling to other cities."	I_S0
"Both of the two phenomenons could render the increasement of car ownership, and with more cars owed by citizens and more frequentily people use cars, traffic jam now becomes a severe problem in many cities."	E_S0
"Governments are supposed to take some actions to stop the problem getting worse."	S_M1
"Firstly, public transport facilities should be built in order to give citizens more choice for commuting."	B_S0
"Besides, a new lifestyle that using bicycles or public transports such as buses instead of cars should be encouraged in cities."	I_S0
"What is more, governments should make some restrictions about when people are allowed to use their own cars."	E_S0
"To conclude, I think the statement claming that many cities now are 'one big traffic jam' because car ownership has increased rapidly in the past thirty years is true and there are some effective measures that can be taken by goverments for releasing the problem of traffic jam."	S_C2

"Currentlt, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people: the government can reduce air pollution by cost of fuel."	B_I0
"Opinion vary from person to person, some people claim that to cost of fuel is the beat way to reduce the air pollution."	I_I0
"However, from my perspective, i think it still have other solution to slove this enviroment."	E_I0
"problem."	O
"Firstly, government can create a new energy to replace the fuel."	S_M1
"To be more specific, if government can find some energy that is cheap and do not have pollute to the air, then this energy will let people still use car."	B_S0
"On the contrary, if the government only raise the cost of fuel, i think it will not have influence to the rich people, because they do not care about these money, so they will still use the fuel car and still pollute the air."	I_S0
"For example, our country has a big problem in the air, that is the air pollution is serious, so our government decide to let all the scientist to create a new energy that can replace the fuel."	I_S0
"So our scientist use five years to create the electronic car, and this car use electric to move, and this type of car is cheaper than the traditional car."	I_S0
"So our country's problem is solve by these electric car."	E_S0
"Secondly, government can attention on the construction site, so move the constuction site to the countryside is also a best solution to government to slove the air pollution problem."	S_M1
"To be more specific, the harmful gas is also the big problem to the air, may be is worse than a car."	B_S0
"On the contrary, if government just focus on the fuel  problem, and ignore the harmful gas problem, then the air pollution will never be solve."	I_S0
"For example, when i was a college student, my dream is help the world to reduce the polltion."	I_S0
"So i find that the harmful gas is a big threat to the air, even bigger than the fuel problem, so when i was gratuate, i work in the government."	I_S0
"So a suggest the government to care about the harmful gas problem, and move the construction site to the countryside, so our country's air become better."	E_S0
 
"It is a tendency that parents pay more attention to the education of their children and they desire to try every possible measure to make their children have a good school performance."	S_I0
"So there has a phenomenon that some parents give much money to their school-age children."	S_T1
"Different people holds different views, some people think this is a bad idea, but I believe this is a good idea, and there some reason to list."	S_T0
"First of all, parents offer their children some money can make the kids get a good grade in the school."	S_M0
"Because if children are awarded some money, they can buy something that they have desired."	B_S0
"And that will facilitate child to more likely get a good mark."	I_S0
"Take my cousin as an example, my uncle, he always awards his son some money if my cousin get a good grade, so everytime my cousin always use this money to buy some joy that he like, since then, my cousin in order to gain this fund, they always to study hard and get a good performance in school."	I_S0
"So my uncle's behave encourage my cousin to study hard, I think this is good behave."	E_S0
"Another reason is that offer some money to children can cultivate kids ability to manage money."	S_M0
"In modern society, the ability in financial management is an important capacity for people's life."	B_S0
"So if children get some money, that will offer an opportunity for kids to manage their money."	I_S0
"For example, when I was a child, my mother always give some money as an award for me, if I can get a good scorn."	I_S0
"So have this money, that means I have own coffer."	I_S0
"Every time when my mother awards some to me, I will save this money, after passing through a long time, a little money becomes a huge sum nowadays."	E_S0
"Admittedly, offer a lot of money as an award to children to get a high grade maybe make some kids misunderstand the meaning of money because they might think to study is equal to get money."	S_M0
"But I think if parents can teach their children for a correct method, kids will can't to misunderstand the money's study's meaning."	B_S1
"So I think to give some money to children facilitate them get a good grade is a good idea."	E_S1
"All in all, offer much money to children encourage them to get a good mark is a good method."	B_C1
"because it can make kids to study hard also can cultivate the children's ability in financial management."	E_C1
 
"In my opinion, there is no doubt that many governments take economic development as their most important goal."	B_T1
"For a country, the economy is its foothold and without the economy, a country can not get a exact development."	I_T1
"And the people of the country cannot be truly happy."	I_T1
"To some extent, we can say that the leader of a country that does not actively develop its economy is not a good and qualified leader."	E_T1
"Similarly, there are also some people who believe that other aspects of development also make sense to a country."	B_S0
"I think such a view is advisable under certain social conditions."	I_S0
"And this prerequisite is that the country's economy has had a certain development."	I_S0
"We have all learned that "economy is the foundation and prerequisite of the political and culture"."	I_S0
"Therefore, to make progress in other aspects, the first thing is to let the economy develop to a certain extent, so that it can support the progress in other aspects."	I_S0
"Of course, for a country, all aspects of development should be put together for a reasonable plan."	I_S0
"We want to see a coordinated development of all aspects, and ultimately promote the overall progress of the whole country and improve its overall strength."	E_S0
"To sum up, we should take a comprehensive view of a country's development in all aspects."	S_C2
"As far as possible to coordinate the proportion between the development of each part, so that each part could play the greatest role, and finally form a mutual promotion, common development of a good outcome."	B_S0
"For a country, its development must be all-round and multi-leveled, rather than a single aspect of progress."	I_S0
"Therefore, we should view all development directions equally, take overall consideration and optimize the combination to promote the growth of a country's comprehensive national strength,which calls a coumtry's true development."	E_S0
 
"The line graph compares the percentage of people in three countries who used the Internet between 2000  and 20025."	B_I0
"It is clear that the proportion of the population who used the Internet increased in each country over the period shown."	I_I0
"Overall, a much larger percentage of Canadians and Americans had access to the Internet in comparison with Mexicans, and Canada experienced the fastest growth in Internet usage."	E_I0
"In 2000, the proportion of people using the Internet in the USA was about 20%."	S_M1
"The figures for Canada and Mexico were lower, at about 10% and 5% respectively."	B_S1

"WHAT IS THE REASON FOR DROPPING OUT"	S_S2
"There comes to a more and more common phenomenon that many young students are leaving schools with negative thoughts on studying, which causes a serious problem for the social education."	S_I0
"In my opinion, the causes are associated with three aspects."	B_T1
"First of all, the education institution, teachers and schools pay more and more attention to the test, thus ignorig the teaching mode."	E_T1
"That is what make the students feeling institutionlized."	S_S1
"Secondly, parents also play a important role in this, they do not try to communicate with their children, they think highly of the scoles, but pay no attention to the interests of their children."	B_I0
"last but not least, the students themselves, most of them do not express their feelings to their parents and they do not want to  communicate with others effectively."	I_I0
"Apparently, the solutions are associated with so many things really."	I_I0
"Some people aim to the school only claming that the whole socity is blamed for the situation."	I_I0
"But as far as I am concerned, as for the school, they should open varieties of classes, serving the students various of marvelous experience, moreover, parents should respect their children and try to build a bridge between them, they should know what thay should do to help their children."	I_I0
"The most important is that students themselves ought to try their best to find out their interests, and spare no efforts to work hard for it."	E_I0
"All in all, if the socity,parents and students can struggle toghther, we can definitely believe that the serious situation can be improved sooner or later."	S_S1
 
"Over recent years ,it has been an increasingly widespread trend that improving the medical care ,as a result ,residents have longer age and increasing life expectancy."	B_T1
"I tend to agree that the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages."	E_T1
"I think there are many benefits when people live longer."	S_M1
"First of all, they can have time to do what they like to do."	B_S0
"Now the pace of life is fast, from primary school to college to work, life is like a pre-planned schedule."	I_S0
"Sometimes we don't have time to think too much and just go with the flow to the next stage."	I_S0
"But if we have a long enough life span, we will have time to summarize, reflect, better understand ourselves, and introduce ourselves to the most suitable field."	I_S0
"Second, we can know more friends, when the life is filled with work or study, we can hardly have free time to participate in group activities, there are few opportunities to contact and know friends, if we have enough time, the situation will change greatly, we can broaden the social circle while working."	E_S0
"Of course, there are some negative effects of increased life expectancy ."	S_M1
"First of all, it may increase the consumption of resources and energy."	B_S0

"Finally, the author argues that it will aid research because it is possible to get large amounts of data from patient records."	B_C1
"However, the lecturer suggests that it will not be helpful for research because access to all medical information is subject to strict privacy laws."	E_C1
"The doctors have to get the patients' permission and follow a lot of complex and strict proceduces."	S_S2
 
"The table illustrates how many tourists wanted to Ashdown Museum  before refurbishment and that of after."	S_I0
"The  pie chart demostrates the percentage of visitors during their travel about their sense of  satified."	S_T1
"According the first table, after decorating."	S_M1
"the person who enjoy the place  outnumber than before."	B_S1
"To be more specific, there is  740000 people decide to travel the place,however,the whole number of people who love to Ashdown Museum is 92000."	E_S1
"It can be seen from the second pie chart that when people travel the museum before refurbishing,the largest visitors about their feedback of felling is dissatisfied,with 40% accounted,while the satifised people dominant during the whole people which keep same with dissatisfied person before refurbishment, 40% occupied."	S_M1
"The proportion of people who is not very pleased about experience before double to that after."	B_S1
"There is similar proportion between the visitor who do not any feedback before ande after."	E_S1
"Overall, the museum is not popular before refurishing, while after refurishment, the museum is more and more interested by visitors"	O
 
"It is generally knowned that a person in senior management positions can get much higher salaries than other worker in the same environment."	S_T1
"For me, I fully understand and totally agree with this opinion."	B_S0
"Firstly, senior managements pay more efforts."	I_S0
"Compared wih ordinary works,  they spare no efforts to work heart and soul for the good of company operation."	I_S0
"They deserve equal pay."	I_S0
"The second item is that senior managements are kind of over qualified, they obtain more information, and have more resources, so that they can do a large number of good things for company which others cannot do."	I_S0
"Senior managements have strong business capability, their pains is take for granted."	I_S0
"In the next place, senior managements have remarkable capacity to work in management positions while ordinary works haven't."	I_S0
"If there is a plan for the survival of the company,  few ordinary clerks can handle it well,but senior managers are far less exposed to problems than they are."	I_S0
"They are very stable and safe for the company."	I_S0
"In conclusion, the comprehensive ability, level and quality are so much strong, having higher pay is undoubtedly the most equitable outcome."	E_S0
 
"Nowadays, as the society develops quikly, there is a hot debate that whether teachers should get at least salary as much as doctors, business leaders or lawyers get."	S_T1
"I disagree with this idea for these reasons."	S_T0
"Firstly, teachers have the qulities that also needed in other works, such as a sense of responsibility, love and highly needed skills and knowledge."	S_M1
"This is because the teachers teaches children who are the future of a country."	B_S0
"In this case, not only do the kids need the knowledge, but also they need to be treated carefully without hurt."	I_S0
"Doctors must be responsible for their patients and the knowledge to save people who are in danger."	I_S0
"Lawyers need to be a sense of justice and knowlege to protect the equal of society."	I_S0
"A business leader should consider for his or her employeers and a knowledge to solve financial problems."	I_S0
"On the contrary, if they don't have these qualities the society will is in a mess."	I_S0
"For example, a recent news that many little kids in kindergarden were hurt by their teachers."	I_S0
"After that, these kids had nightmares every day."	I_S0
"In this case, they cannot grow up healthily."	I_S0
"So I think they share the same qualities."	E_S0
"Secondly, teachers make a great effort as these positions do, which is work hard whenever their objects need help."	S_M1
"This is because a student may need help after school."	B_S0
"In this situation, the teacher has to extra task."	I_S0
"When a patient is in danger at midnight, even though the doctor is at home, he has to rush to hospital immediately."	I_S0
"When an inspiration occurs, the lawyer has to continue analyze carefully."	I_S0
"Whenever a case can be discussed, a business leader has to negotiate immediately."	I_S0
"In contrast, if they are not devoted to their work, students cannot get progress; patients cannot obtain first aid; peopel cannot be cleared; workers cannot get salary and do on."	I_S0
"For instance, my cousin is a Chinese teacher in Wuhan NO.1 High School, who work at midnight to check her students homework."	E_S0
 
"Nowadays, people are faced with different kinds of pressure, thus making relaxing significant."	B_I0
"Some people would like to watch a movie or read a book to get a relax, while others prefer to do sports."	I_I0
"As for me, I would like to play sports when I felt tired."	E_I0
"For doing sports can make me meet different friends and at the same time, make me healthier and stronger."	S_T1
"Different from watching or reading alone, doing sports can give access to different people."	S_M0
"compared with lying on your bed or sofa and watch a movie, playing sports forces you to go out and meet others."	B_S0
"And this can boarden your social circle and make you feel less lonely."	I_S0
"I met one of my best friends while I was playing basketball one day."	I_S0
"We played together and became good frieds."	I_S0
"We are still contacting with each other now and if I chose to stay at home everyday, I wouldn't have met so nice a girl."	E_S0
"It's also good for your health if you relax yourself by doing physical exercise."	S_M0
"Once you get out and feel the gentle wind, the fresh air and beautiful scenes, you will feel joyful."	B_S0
"After running or playing some ball games, you may sweat a lot, thus making wasted materia in your body get out."	I_S0
"Your musules can also be trained during your exercise and you can feel much more energetic."	I_S0
"My father even found that he could sleep better after running for an hour to relax, thus making him less likely to get tired when he is working."	E_S0
"Of course if you stay at home and read or watch movies alone, you can get a mental satisfaction, but it will make you lazier and less likely to exercise."	S_M0
"what's more, you will be addicted to the book or the movie and this will have a negative influence on your following work."	B_S1
"And if you choose a book that is not so relaxing, you will feel much moer tired after your "relaxation"."	E_S1
"There is no doubt that relaxing yourself at home by reading a book or watching a movie is a good way, but doing ex"	S_C2
 
"The bar graph illustrates the amount of carbon emissions in 6 countries in 1975, 1990 and 2005."	S_I0
"It is obvious that the USA emitted the larggest quantities of cacbon in those three years."	S_M2
"And the secong one is China."	B_S0
"The other countries were much lower relatively and not more than 400000."	I_S0
"The amount of carbon emissions in USA, China, Canada and India were growing in every three years."	I_S0
"Especially China had a dramaticly growth in 2005, which is nearly 1500000."	I_S0
"In the same year, the USA approached almost 1600000."	I_S0
"On the contrary, Canada' s level increased smoothly each year, but carbon emissions in India increased from nearly 100000 in 1975 to 350000 in 2005."	I_S0
"The United Kingdom's level didn' t have a huge change."	E_S0
 
"As the world comes into the Internet era,people's demand on the access to the web is getting higher."	B_I0
"As a result,some people may hold the opinion that projects that aims to improve the Internet have priority than those which  improve public transportation in governments' budget."	I_I0
"However,to give my own point,programs that encourage the development of public transportation deserve more financial support."	E_I0
"To begin with,a better net of transportation will undoubtly accelerate the development in the country."	S_M0
"A mature system of transportation such as rail roads and airlines is the foundation of economy."	B_S0
"For example,in the southwestern part of China,the local economy depend heavily on the agricultural products like tea."	I_S0
"However,the development in those area was limited before because of the lack of transportation."	I_S0
"Recently,a series of public roads and rails including the high speed rails has been constructed there."	I_S0
"As a result,more people are able to purchase the products from there witch in turns encourage the increasement of productivity in the southwestern area in China."	E_S0
"Moreover,the transprotation is the bridge of cultural communication."	S_M0
"To illustrate this point,I would like to compare the situation in the past in China with that in the modern."	B_S0
"Several decades ago,communication between provinces even cities was stuck because of the unconvenience caused by poor transportation."	I_S0
"It took people in southern area several days to get to the north by trains."	I_S0
"As a result,people,including students were unlikely go to the places that were far away for study or other purposes."	I_S0
"As time goes by,several lines of high speed rails has been done over the country which make it possible for people to cover thousands of miles in several hours."	I_S0
"Thus,public communication is encouraged."	E_S0
"Finally,the drawbacks of improving Internet are also obvious."	S_M0
"Since the booming of social apps based on the Internet,communication in person between people drops."	B_S1
"People tend to chat with their friends through the net instead of doing it face to face."	E_S1
"Above all,more inveatment on public transportation"	S_S2
 
"The lecture explains how migrate by navigation of stars."	B_I0
"But the professor speech doesn't agree with these viewpoints."	I_I0
"First, the lecture thinks that the humpback whales are enough intelligent to navigate by stars."	I_I0
"However, the professor says that there is not straight connection between intelligence and the ability of using stars."	I_I0
"Some birds have this ability such as ducks, but ducks' intelligence is really notmal."	E_I0
"This is just their ability borned with, not a sign of intelligence."	S_T1
"Second, the lecture gives the evidence that humpback whales migrate in straight lines and animals can maintain straight lines only when forced by external objects."	S_M1
"But the professor refutes that humpback whales have a  substance in their brains, which can enable them to feel the magnetic field of Earth."	B_S1
"The fact shows that humpback whales are navigated by the magnetic field of Earth not stars."	E_S1
"Third, the lecture shows that humpback whales are sometimes observed floating straight up and look at stars for minures."	S_M1
"But the professor says that this behavior is not associated with looking at stars."	B_S0
"For example, some sharks do this."	I_S0
"But sharks don't migrate also don't look at stars."	I_S0
"They do this for look for preys."	I_S0
"And another thing, humpback whales often spy-hopping during the day and they can't see the stars."	E_S0
 
"As the technology are developing rapidly, The people in the whole world is connected more firmly than any time in the past."	S_I0
"So as far as I am concerned, it is much more significant to relate well to people than to study hard in school."	S_T0
"Firstly, the ability to relate well to people will make it easy to cooperate with others."	S_M0
"Nowaday it is impossible for a single person to complete a complex task."	B_S0
"So we need the teamwork to finish the assignment and be successful in a future job."	I_S0
"I will use my experience as an example."	I_S0
"When I was serving as a worker in a company for a while during the summer vacation, I found everyone in the company was unfriendly and what they focused on everyday was just their work."	I_S0
"As a result, in the afternoon of my first day in that company, I volunteered to buy some delicious snacks for them."	I_S0
"I only spent little money but made everyone smile."	I_S0
"And the next day, we could chat with each other about only only works but also our daily lives."	I_S0
"In a word, we were getting to be friends rather than strangers working together and as a warm team, we can work much more efficiently than before."	E_S0
"Secondly, being able to relate well to people is good for our emotional health as well."	S_M0
"Human beings belong to social animals, and we are easier to be unhealthy emotionally if we are apart from the group."	B_S0
"For example, when I was studying in primary school."	I_S0
"one classmate of mine had serious emotional illness because he had never communicated with everyone."	I_S0
"Consequently, he could pass the middle school extrance exam since he was unable to get any knowledge during his primary school's classes."	I_S0
"If he could relate well to people, he wouldn't have such a bad enotional illness and he could grew up happily."	E_S0
"There is no doubt that studying hard in school is absolutely positive for us."	S_M0
"However, it is not as important as being able to relate well to people."	B_S1
"Only when we can relate well to others can we cooperate and have healthy emotion, which are valid for our success in a future job."	E_S1
"To sum up, the ability to relate well to p"	O

"Me and my mother."	B_S0

"My mother coking is aloso very nice."	E_S0
 
"A great number of countries are in the grip of a teenage crime wave in today’s world."	S_I0
"Although it is difficult to pinpoint the precise causes of juvenile delinquency, from my perspective, there are three main factors contributing to this problem."	S_T0
"First and foremost, a minor who has a lower intelligence and who does not receive a proper education is more prone to become involved in delinquent conduct."	S_M0
"Besides, at school, when teens are bullied, teased, or left out, they may resort to violence or join gangs, which will eventually lead to committing more crimes."	B_S0
"Other individual factors including impulsive behavior and uncontrolled aggression can also result in a juvenile's involvement in harmful, destructive and illegal activities."	I_S0
"What’s worse, adolescents suffering from a definable alcohol, drug, or mental disorder may take revenge on peer groups, friends, families even the society."	E_S0
"Furthermore, family factors such as a lack of proper parental supervision, ongoing parental conflict, neglect, abuse and so on, whether emotional, psychological or physical, are not only detrimental to children’s growth but also the inducements of teenagers’ crimes."	S_M0
"Generally, those teens who display the weakest attachment to their parents and families are far more likely to engage in inappropriate activities."	S_S2
"In addition, there is no denying that the violence in the media can bring about an increase in the rate of youth crimes."	S_M0
"To be specific, some violent TV programs and computer games may negatively influence youngsters' mental growth and development."	B_S1
"Those who watch a large amount of simulated violence, particularly in video games, can become immune to it and more inclined to act violently."	E_S1
"How to punish those juvenile delinquents should depend on the specific situations."	S_M0
"For example, for teenage minor crimes like vandalism, fighting, graffiti or theft, the law can compel these young people to repair damaged articles, make apologies or compensations, and do voluntary community services."	B_S1
"Nevertheless, For serious crimes like homicides, those teens who commit felonies should be penalized severely as adults."	E_S1
"In conclusion, individual, family and social elements are significant reasons that cannot be ignored in juvenile delinquency."	B_C0
"In reality, juveniles may be exposed to all the three factors above simultaneously."	I_C0
"Therefore, punishments should be different in the light of factual conditions."	E_C0
 
"In today's society, getting a good education is the key factor for a child's development."	S_I0
"Some people think that parents should teach their children good social manners."	B_T0
"Some people think that schools should be places to learn these things."	E_T0
"Parents can teach their children good social etiquette mainly because parents spend the most time with their children."	S_M2
"They are able to teach their children good manners in the little things of life."	B_S0
"What's more, parents' behavior can set a good example to their children, thus influencing their children's behavior subtly."	I_S0
"However, schools also teach children good social etiquette."	I_S0
"This is because school life occupies a large part of children's lives."	I_S0
"The systematic teaching of teachers can guide children to form good habits."	E_S0
"In my opinion, children's good social etiquette needs the help of both parents and the school."	S_C2
 
"Nowadays, some parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school."	S_I0
"From my opinion, that's quite not a wise way to encourage children."	S_T1
"In the first place, many children can't manage money well, and will even spend their money casually on something unnecessary."	S_M2
"Take myself for example, when I study at elementary school, I often bought some little things in shops outside school after class."	B_S0
"Secondly, if parents took this method to encourage thier children to study harder, the children would probably study for the money other than getting knowledge, which is rather an awful circumstance."	I_S0
"As you know, whatever we do, wo should have a right purpose, or we may not get something."	I_S0
"In additional, when parents always offer thier children money by this measure, children will be misled that gaining money is not that difficult."	I_S0
"Only if the children work by themselves, could they understand how tough it is to earn money, so that they may understand they should particularly value their money."	I_S0
"What's more, I hold the view that proper praise is needed for good work at school, whic"	E_S0
 
"In my opinion, first government should take recycling as a part of education in schools."	S_T0
"Because it is very hard to require everyone to do the recycling every week or month."	B_T1
"It needs to change the idea in people's mind and easist way is to put recycling in school's education for children's views about the world or scoiety is not matrue, which means it is very easy to change their idea about something, for example, cycling."	I_T1
"According to research, 90 days' repeating becomes stable habits."	E_T1
"If after a year -- we take a litter longer because recycling is not an everyday action -- education, children or their families could not do the recycling by theirselves, I think to some extent we could consider that it is too hard to make people recycling by theirselves, then in order to achieve sustainability, recycling has to be writen in law."	S_S2
"However, this law should not be strict as others."	S_M2
"The punishment for not respecting the law should only be fineing."	B_S0
"This law should be more like a criterion which encourages people to recyeling in order not to destory their enthusiasm about it."	I_S0
"I also think this law should include the education about recycling."	I_S0
"People should be familiar with the different kinds of recyclable materials so that they could do it better."	E_S0
"Recycling is of great importance in sustainability, so we should take it as a part of our education."	S_C2
"However, if the fact proves that people could not spontaneously do it, we need a law to make sure of it."	S_S2
 
"The table gives us information about how many people visited Ashdown Museum during the year before and the year after it was refurbished."	B_I0
"There were 74000 visitors to this museum during the year before refurbishment,and there were 92000 visitors during the year after refurbishment."	E_I0
"The two pie charts illustrate the satisfaction of visitors before and after the refurbishment."	B_T1
"We can see that before the refurbishment, 15% of the interviewees were "very satisfied",while after the refurbishment ,35% of the interviewees were "very satisfied"."	E_T1
"Before the refurbishment,vistors who were "satisfied" accounting for 30%,"dissatisfied"represented 40%."	B_S0
"There were 10% visitors felt "very dissatisfied" and 5% felt "no response"."	I_S0
"After the refurbishment,40% visitors felt "satisfied",while merely 15% felt "dissatisfied" and 5% felt "very dissatisfied" ,5% of them had no response."	E_S0
"In sum,before the refurbishment,fewer than a half of visitors felt "very satisfied" or "satisfied",while after the refurbishment,there were 75% of them described themselves as "very satisfied" and "satisfied"."	S_S2
 
"Some people argue that students who are poor or from rural areas should be accepted by university easier than others in the country."	S_T0
"Though students come from countryside may have different education conditions,I still think it is unfair for students in other areas."	S_T1
"So I do not agree with this opinion."	S_T0
"If universities accept students from rural areas with widen conditions and some kinds of special policies,the equity of education will be ruined."	S_M1
"For example,some parents in the city may make some fake profiles to pretend to live in countryside,then their children will have more chances to go to famous universities easier."	B_S0
"Also,students study in the cities do their best to attend the fair exam,but facing the unfair entrance conditions before go to college."	I_S0
"Some of them may feel pessimistic and give up making efforts."	E_S0
"Though students from different areas have different education resources,the government has take actions to solve the problem."	S_M1
"With the development of technologies,the distant education is becoming more and more popular."	S_S2
"Students in the rural"	O
 
"Some people say that home is not enough waste can be recycled, they said the only way to increase recycling is make the legalization of government."	S_T1
"Do you think that in order to let more people to recycle waste, legal action is necessary?"	B_S1
"Law can help people establish and cultivate the consciousness of the recycling, especially for this problem is not aware of or don't have the time to do recycling mandatory laws can effective deterrent to recycle and reuse, and constraint people because there's costs increase once don't follow the law to force can really do comprehensive resource conservation, environmental protection, such as the handling of waste paper and waste water
Recycling itself is a cooperative behavior, there are legal intervention, appear very harsh and oppressive, easy to arouse people's dissatisfaction, it is bad for people to understand the importance and necessity of recycling the real even generate the corresponding legal provisions for recycling behavior to constraints, in addition to the company, large factories and public institutions, the most ordinary people and not because the performance of the recycling and high cost and price, can't get very good protection effect"	E_S1
 
"Nowadays, the world become more techonlogial therefore TV channels get more choices than several years ago."	S_T1
"Some people teem that have more TV channels is fabulous on account of they will have more choices to watch they want to watch."	B_S0
"But others consider too much TV channels will decline TV program's quality."	I_S0
"In my opinion i think more TV channels is wonderful because we can see more programs."	I_S0
"On the one hand, some people think it is necessary to decline TV programs because when they watch TV they found so many TV  program is terrible."	I_S0
"meanwhile, they can not find TV program what they want to watch."	I_S0
"Firstly, i think this is elder's thinking on account of mordern TV programs are romatic, realistic,terrify topic and senior don't like this topic."	I_S0
"My grandparents are examples of this people."	I_S0
"Secondly,some managers just want to get theirs profit,so they never inspect program's quality."	I_S0
"This is main reason of TV channels only leads to a lot of poor quality TV programs."	I_S0
"Overall,TV program's quality is declining but TV channels are not manin reason."	I_S0
"On the other hand,others teem having more TV channels is good because they will have more choices to choose what they really want."	I_S0
"I absolutely concur this opinion on account of if TV channels are myraids, it means we can choose untill we find TV program what we want to watch."	I_S0
"We have the right to change programs."	I_S0
"It is aslo a repestion for consumer."	I_S0
"From what has been discussed, we can draw the conclusion that having more TV channels is a good thing."	I_S0
"More TV channels makes our life more colorful."	E_S0
 
"Students do not like study in this age,their feel tired and uncomfortable about study."	S_T1
"They think study is a trouble."	B_S0
"I think there are three reasons that caused the thinking of students."	I_S0
"First,student do not like study what they do not intersted in."	I_S0
"People can keep working on their hobby,and they will against what they do not like."	I_S0
"For example,some student like drawing,so they can sit and draw whole day."	I_S0
"Some student do not like study English,so they sleep in English class."	I_S0
"Secondly,Student do not like teacher to order them."	I_S0
"Student like free,they do not want people force them to do something."	I_S0
"If their parents or teacher press them to study,they will against their order."	I_S0
"This is because teenagers have their own ideas."	I_S0
"They think they can make ideas by themselves."	I_S0
"lastly,Students like do same things with their classmates or friends."	I_S0
"People are social animal,so they like do same things like other people."	I_S0
"If a big mass of  students are playing games,remainning students will imitate them."	I_S0
"After class,they will have a topic to disscuss."	I_S0
"I have two ideas to fix the thinking of students."	I_S0
"The most useful way is guide the interest of students,Combine learning with interest."	I_S0
"Therefore,student can study gladly."	I_S0
"The another way is reward students."	I_S0
"If their grades are increaseing,parents and teachers may give them some awards."	I_S0
"Then,they will feel the advantages of study,so they will study harder."	I_S0
"Study can be a interesting thing for student."	I_S0
"Student can also be interested in study."	I_S0
"The most important thing is improve the good impression to study of student."	E_S0

"To be more specific, in 1920, two accesses of the park were located in the Arnold Avenue and the Eldon Street respectively, with seats on the west of them."	E_M0

"There is a general dicussion about the issue of economic development in nowadays society."	S_I0

"From my perspective, I agree with the latter."	E_T0

"There is a heated debate over whether rising the number of sports equipment is the beast method to improve individuals health."	S_I0
"I personally hold a view that government should spend more money publicity campaign to make citizens aware of the significance of sports instead of constructing more facilities that only a few people use in spite of some people have various opinions."	S_T0

"So the situation of the different family is different."	B_S0
"Such as the differences in parents'thinking, wealth and personality."	I_S0
"All of these factors will affect children's character and life."	I_S0

"From my point of view, government should implement policies to restrict an increasing number of private cars as well as the household should improve the awareness of responsibility for the society."	E_I0
"To begin with, two provoking proofs can be figured out to account for this suggestions."	S_M2
"One is that government could increase the price of cars or the petrols that can significantly reduce the sells volume of cars."	B_S0
"Due to some citizens cannot afford too pricy one thus the consumption declined."	I_S0
"Secondly, government could invest the public transport system such as subway, bus , E-bike."	I_S0
"What's more the public sector also could give subsidies to the public transport in order to stimulate the citizens use the public vehicles as well as increase their disposable income which could 
Furthermore, according government interventions, there is no doubt that some demerits exist."	I_S0
"For instance, improved price of cars may not affect the rich person's purchasing power."	I_S0
"they may cost a little money purchase cars which account for small proportion of their income."	I_S0

"The passage thinks that there are three possible origins of the "Voynich manuscript"."	S_I0
"However, the listening material has different ideas."	S_T1
"First, the passage points out that this manuscript was written by a complex cipher by a physician and botanist in the sixteenth century, because the illustrations in the manuscript are similar to those written in this doctor's book, A Little Herbal."	S_M0
"But the speaker disagree with it."	B_S0
"It is believed that what the Voynich manuscript conveys is important, and a doctor does not need to make such a complicated secret document."	I_S0
"The book written by this doctor does not have his own original point of view, so it is impossible to be the author of the manuscript."	E_S0
"Secondly, the author suggests that the manuscript is false and meaningless, and Edward sold the book as a magic book to European nobles for money."	S_M0
"Nevertheless, the professor is against with it."	B_S0
"Voynich manuscript is very complicated, and Edward did not need to spend so much effort to write this manuscript in order to make money from the rich."	I_S0
"And people at the time were easily deceived."	I_S0
"A simple book can achieve his purpose"	E_S0
"Third, the article believes that this manuscript is a modern counterfeit created by Wilfried M. Vohnich himself."	S_M0
"Because he is an antique bookseller."	B_S0
"He has the ability to make an old book."	I_S0
"the listening material thinks this explanation is not convincing."	I_S0
"The parchment and ink used in the manuscript are more than 400 years old."	I_S0
"For Voynich, it can get more than 400 years of parchment, but he can't get more than 400 years of ink."	I_S0
"So this manuscript was created before Voynich got it."	E_S0

"It is generally acknowledged that economics plays an important role in countries, some of which see it as the most important goal, while others hold the thoughts that other types of progress are equally important."	B_I0
"Why do they have such two opposite opinions?"	E_I0
"There are numerous people who believe that nothing is more important than money."	S_M1

"So does some governments, who consider economic progress as advance in comprehensive national power and atisfaction of people's lives."	I_S0
"The two things can bring the country together and make it far stronger."	E_S0
"However, a great number of people suggest that the government should not place economic progress as the top goal, because there are other types of progress like educational development and healthcare which serve the same important role for national development."	S_M1
"Without fully developed systems of every type,one country can not stand long."	B_S0
"People have diversified kinds of need, not only the need for fortune."	I_S0
"Government should satisfy people's needs in various ways."	E_S0
"As far as I am concerned, I do agree with the number of people who thick that there are other types of progress which are just as important as economic progess."	S_C2
"Even though we have tons of money, we still can not buy happiness and health."	B_S1

"In recent decades, shopping has sparked a heated discussion among the public."	B_I0
"some people willing to buy things that are useless and expensive that they can not bear the burden with debt."	E_I0
"In my opinion, there are plenty of reasons and suggestions for this phenomenon."	S_T0
"To start with, it is widely accepted that there are a lot of apps and companies out there that people can borrow from."	S_M1
"some companies need financing, so they start projects that can be loaned."	B_S0
"The company does not set an amount that suits everyone's ability to repay."	I_S0
"and some people have wake self-control."	I_S0
"Besides, there is no doubt that some people keep up with the joneses."	I_S0
"there are all kinds of productions are provided to people to buy."	I_S0
"such as some luxury, like handbags, many girls may want to have may luxury handbags when seeing others wore."	I_S0
"but they do not have extra money to buy it, only used debt."	I_S0
"as bills mount up, the person may not be able to pay."	I_S0
"people should buy anything you need, if not that is called waste."	E_S0
"The effect of this phenomenon is very important to us as well as to the group and the unit."	S_M1
"suggestions are that companies should set the appropriate loan amount for different people."	B_S0
"and the governments should appeal to people to be with the usual mind."	I_S0
"and some luxury band should reduce the price by reducing the cost of the advertisement."	E_S0
"those changes should be done from everyone, every group, and government."	S_C2
 
"In my opinion,i think lesss TV channels is better."	S_T1
"here is my personal think about my opinion。"	O
"First,The TV station can puts more manpower and resources on one TV channels，it really does helps to get a good quality。"	B_S0
"Second，they have more time to think about ideas， shooting program and editing，more people might watch this TV channels about this，because people really needs the TV channels which have more divers element，good editing and perfectly framing。that makes stand out in many shows。"	I_S0
"Third，less TV channels take more less industry competition。many TV producer want beat their rivals what ever it takes。So appears many vicious competition。they spend money on advertising，invite famous person and so on。it almost take all of funds。about programs content they dont have enough money to make。it usually makes bad quality。"	E_S0

"Salvage logging is an approach to recovering a damaged forest."	B_I0
"However, oppinions differ in the consequences brought by the savalge logging."	E_I0
"The author believes it is beneficial both to the forests and to the economy while the professor claims that it will actually casue serious damage to the environment."	S_T0
"Initially, based on the fact that savalge logging can remove the dead tree remains, the author thinks it will provide space for fresh grow, thus helping the damaged areas recover."	S_M0
"Nevertheless,  the professor refutes that even though it can clear up for fresh growth, it not necessarily creates a right condition for the tree growtu."	B_S1
"Soil in the forests after a fire lack nutritional value, which is not suitable for the growth of offsprings."	E_S1
"Secondly, the author also talks about its benefit of mitigating the insect infestation which results in the insect habitat built by decaying wood."	S_M0
"But the professor argues that the spruce bark beetle has survived in the forests for hundreds of years, but it does not pose a threat to the health of the forest."	B_S1
"Considerable amount of birds and insects live together in the forest, which is beneficial to the forest's long-term health."	E_S1
"Finally, as the author mentions, the savalge logging has economic benefits as well as creating extra jobs for the local people."	S_M0
"On the contrary, the professor considers this economic benefit as a small one that will not last long."	B_S0
"Even in a forest severely damaged by the fire, helicopters can be used to save the expenses."	I_S0
"What's more, the job created by salvage logging is temporary and the industries tend to hire outsiders who are more experienced than the local residents."	E_S0
"Above all, the adoption of salvage logging is a controversial issue so people need to take comprehensive and thorough possible consequences into consideration before carrying out this action."	S_C2
 
"nowadays, it is a trendency to be high educated."	S_T1
"Because, in the future, it means a high salary job, a better living circumustance and a better life, which is cannot be realized under a poor education."	S_T0
"Thus, many parents are enger to let their chilren get good educate and get a good grades in school."	S_T1
"And parents want to reach that goal, they tried a lot of methods to inspire their children's study will."	S_T0
"Some of them offer thheir kids money if they get good grades in school."	S_S2
"And I agree with it in three parts."	S_T0
"First of all, giving them money will stimulate their study will, and they will study harder."	S_M1
"They will think that money is a present for their good grade."	B_S0
"For example, I used to be bored in studying in primary school."	I_S0
"And no matter how my parents told me the benefits of study, it did not work."	I_S0
"Nevertheless, one day, may father told me that if I got 10 point improve in my next math exam, he would give me 10 yuan."	I_S0
"It could buy a lot of snacks in 10 yuan."	I_S0
"And as 10 yuan for my goal."	I_S0
"A month later, I got 11 point improve."	I_S0
"So I think give money is a great way to stimulate children to study."	E_S0
"Second, it will train children to have a financial thinking."	S_M1
"Financial thinking is an essential ability when they grow up."	B_S0
"I can vividly remember that my father told me that when he was young, he would get reward by helping parents doing housework."	I_S0
"And because of these rewards, he got a chance to manage his assets."	I_S0
"He also appreciated that because of the experience of manage money when he was young."	I_S0
"Now, he can earn and save money for this family."	E_S0
"Third,"	S_S2
 
"Admittedly, the topic relating to contaminate and environmental-friendly materials is getting its heat."	B_I0
"And the problem has already been taken care of by government conducting influential propaganda among the public."	I_I0
"However, some of the citizens may ignore this pressing  issue from time to time."	I_I0
"As a consequence, there is a voice showing up, which suggest the local regime to take action to make recycling programme legal even forced."	E_I0
"Personally I deeply hold that government should be significantly involved in the environment-protecting projects but the measures need implying step by step and finally legalize for the reason that countable facts may should be taken into account."	S_T1
"First thing required in recycling is that waste-classification."	S_M2
"As a result citizens have to possess basic recycling knowledge in order to meet legal requirement in the meanwhile the infrastructures such as classified waste buckets are placed."	B_S0
"Citizens in some of the  area may not ready to welcome the recycling law before these premise are met."	I_S0
"The next thing the government should pay attention to is the products in markets, which means that the materials used in the daily products are fully reusable or not."	I_S0
"I strongly doubt that some of merchandises are not durable as we presume moreover part of them may be toxic to human beings after several times using."	I_S0
"Then the question will be what the safe times a product can be used and how to tell the difference between reusable items and those one-term products?"	E_S0
"In fact these two dimensions are just tiny parts of the premise when government to take action to require recycling ."	B_C1
"The point of this article is quite clear: making legal requirement relating to environment is a serious problem needed to be reconsidered from many factors, far more than just bring  out a law without any leading process."	E_C1
 
"Nowadays, as the technology developing, media has become a method to spread information and show personal attitudes ."	S_I0
"In my opinion, I agree that people can control ideas and attitudes by controlling media and it is difficult to correct it."	S_T0
"First, most people get knowledge from social media, so someone just needs to put the information on online page then people are easier to accept or even change their own ideas."	S_M1
"Additionally, people always using midia to repeating one thing is a good way to make a deep impression."	B_S0
"What is more, by media, many people will know the news in that time giving a attitude on purpose ,so it is to make a trend which lets more people to follow."	I_S0
"They also are capable of making people to give up own ideas to trust most people's choice."	E_S0
"There will still be those who insist that their ideas are not influenced by the outside world so that controlling media is a meaningless way."	S_M1
"Controlling the media is a very difficult task because it requires not only time and money but also intelligence and planning."	B_S0
"And now people are more rational, they will think before they choose to believe."	I_S0
"Using media to control people's thoughts and attitudes is easily condemned by the public and punished by the law"	E_S0

"In this essay, I shall explain why I think that it is a good idea for secondary school students to do compulsory community service."	O
"The main reason that I believe this is that it provides secondary school students with wider knowledge about, and experience of, their community and society in general."	B_I0
"Some types of community service involve working with sick or disabled people, giving students the opportunity to help those who are less fortunate."	I_I0
"Other kinds of community service give students the chance to work with children or work on projects to improve the community."	E_I0
"All of these broaden horizons and demonstrate to students what their place in society is."	S_T1
"Another key advantage of community service for secondary school students is that it can provide them with some work experience."	S_M1
"This is particularly true in some sectors, such as health care, but I think that community service generally provides people with a work ethic which will obviously be helpful throughout their lives."	B_S1
"The fact that the work is unpaid might inspire some students to continue with community service even when it is not a compulsory part of their secondary school curriculum."	E_S1
"In addition, many community services suffer from a lack of volunteers, so using secondary school students in this way provides enough people to meet this shortfall."	S_M1
"The supply of students is very likely to continue as older students leave school but new ones enter, so the provision of these community services is almost guaranteed."	S_S2

"So more channels can have more choice."	I_S0

"Nowadays, as we all know, there are many different ways for students to study."	B_I0
"And sometimes they may be assigned to finish the project."	I_I0
"So there is a type of situation, professors may require them to work together."	I_I0
"And this type of means are thought to be less effective for students to study."	I_I0
"On the contrary, I think working together as a group is a great way for students to learn more effectively."	I_I0
"Communicating with each other can widen their horizon and make the plans more bueatiful, and also the clear role in the team can make the work finished faster."	E_I0

"With the demands increasing of more colorful TV channels, it remains a question how to garantee the quality of the TVprograms."	S_I0

"TV has displaced film as our country's most popular form of entertainment."	B_S0

"It's reasonable that the pubilc prefers more choices of TV channels."	I_S0
"But as a matter of fact , having more channels means having more problems."	I_S0
"For instance, the over consumption of the super stars makes the entertainment abused."	I_S0
"Moreover, all the TV programs need to meet the morden people and the ratings ,which brings competition,imagination but also similarities."	I_S0
"In order to aviod a lot of poor quality TV programs,the state administation of radio film and television becomes more strict with the coming TV series and TV programs."	I_S0
"In a word, it's a good phenomenon that different forms of TV programs occured."	I_S0

"There is no doubt that communities play a vital role in people's daily lives."	B_I0
"However, nowadyas whether young people spend enough time to helping the communities or not is controversial."	E_I0
"In my opinion, I think young people today indeed do not give enough help to the communities."	S_T0
"First of all, young people nowadays do not have enough free time to help others."	S_M1
"As the stress of young people is becoming higher and higher, no matter those students in schools or those people at work both have too much things to do, as a result, it will be tough for them to find sufficient free time to help their communities."	B_S0
"For instance, when I was studied in the university, I had so much things to deal with every day that I even did not  have any free time to do other things."	I_S0
"I had to pay much attention to my courses and it was also necessary for me to participate in many activities organized by the sports club and also sometimes I would join in some competitions like debate which needed a lot of preparation."	I_S0
"By all of these, it was really hard for me to find enough time to help my communities as many times they came to asking for my help what I could say is suggesting them to look for others' help."	E_S0
"Second, now more young people is more apathy and more likely to enjoy their life alone rather than spending time on helping others."	S_M1
"With the development of the technology, now it is possible for a person to only use high-tech devices like mobile phones or computers to live alone without others' company which make people more unconcerned than before."	B_S0
"To illustrate, my cousin used to study with me in the same university."	I_S0
"He was very apathy that he could just sat their with playing his mobile phone for a whole day."	I_S0
"It was not necessary for him to get on with others or give help when others need."	I_S0
"When we all participated in an activity needing team work, he refused to join in and did not give any help to us group because of the lack of team spirit."	I_S0
"Thus, nowadays many times young people are not used to helping others, that is why they do not spend enough time giving help to their communities."	E_S0
"All in all, for all these reasons, I indeed believe that young people now do not spend enough time helping the communities."	S_C2
 
"Nowadays, more and more people start to pay attention to the public health."	S_I0
"Some people think the best way to improve public health is by increasing the number of sports facilities."	B_T0
"However others say that  this action would have little effect and that other measures are required."	I_T0
"I am more inclined to support the first oppion."	E_T0
"We have to admit that other measures are required such as the tea house and the cafe house."	S_M1
"There are many people who want some place to relax after one day's annoying daily work, but these place would not have the same effect as much as the sport facilties."	S_S2
"Frist at all,  many people are full of awareness of healthy daily life and they would like do more exersice after work or during other free time, but they don't own place and some facilities."	S_M1
"So, at this time, the sport facilties are seemly necessary."	B_S0
"After that, sport facilties would not occupy too many places and not cost too much."	I_S0
"The local goverment won't have any financial pressure."	I_S0
"It is conveniont to build in the community for citistens."	E_S0

"The professor thinks the hypothesis is not ture for these reasons."	B_T1
"First,although the edmontosaurs were fed by plants ang they need a lots of food during the winter."	I_T1
"One hundred years ago,there is warmer than today."	E_T1
"In the peaks of the summer ,the sun even shone 24 hours one day."	B_S0
"Beacuse of that ,the plants can grow very well in this warm conditions."	I_S0
"So when the winters came,though some plants will die during the cold winter,the died plants is enough to feed the hole families of the edmontosuars."	I_S0
"So it is not necessary for them to migrate during the winter."	E_S0
"Second,according to the professor,not all the animals live in herds migrate when climate changed."	S_M2
"Some of the animals just live in the herds for a protection."	B_S0
"And if the edmontosaurs migrate during the winter,they have to bring their juveniles with them."	I_S0
"But the skeletons of the juveniles can hradly tolerate the long distanse journey."	I_S0
"So the juveniles wound slow down the speed of the edmontosuar spices."	I_S0

"I'm afraid that I don't agree with the parents' behaviours."	S_T1
"Here's my reason."	B_S0
"First of all, school-age children may usually have such a doubt "why should I learn this boring things and it seems they will never be used in my life again"."	I_S0
"By giving them money as a reward, these parents give them an answer:" learning these things is for a high grade"."	I_S0
"The harm that gives the children such an thought is not clear, but it will gradually begin to work."	I_S0
"It will make the children think that "knowledge is not important itself, what truely matters is a high mark" ."	I_S0
"In other words, what the children think highly of is not knowledge but a high mark that can be exchaged into money."	I_S0
"So it will not be surprising that some children may cheat during exams because in their opinion of value, only the mark and the result is important, none of the other things, such as knowlegde, honestness or means of getting a good mark can be the same."	I_S0
"Sadly, such a child may loss passion in the process."	I_S0
"He may no longer cherish the hard working process with his schoolmates, what is actually the most meaning memory of our school life, he may no longer seem the fruit of hard working as a treasure, instead he may think it just a waste of time because it isn't that efficent."	I_S0
"I can still remember when I was young, my mom treated me with the same way as the parents do."	I_S0
"It works in some perspective that my grades increase at a high speed, however that make me a different kid as before."	I_S0
"I thought grades are everything."	I_S0
"I may laugh at my classmates who work hard but fail to do well in his remarks, and I only wanted to become friends with those who have good grades even if they were not kind persons and loved to trick on others."	I_S0
"Points may be important, but it is important because it is a witness of our hard working."	I_S0
"However, if the parents do so, points become the only important thing, low points by hard working means nothing, high points without hard working can still be a reason of awards and cheers."	I_S0
"I think it is deadly harmful to a child's growth."	E_S0
 
"With an increasing amount  of awareness toward education, children's life become a hot spot in the world."	B_I0
"Some children are required for  doing homework or participate in activities in order to enhance their knowledge."	E_I0
"On the other hand,some parents give their children more time to do whatever they want."	B_T0
"I agree with the latter and this statement can be proved by analyzing the following reasons."	E_T0
"In the first place,  letting  children do their favorite things can cultivate their good personality."	S_M0
"This is due to the fact that children do whatever they want, they will be more willing to communicate with their partners, which allows children become more opening and outgoing."	B_S1
"Therefore, children will build a good personality."	E_S1

"My sister is in the primiry school, my parents never forced her to do things she does not like."	B_S0

"In the process of doing favorite activities , my sister is willing to talk with others."	I_S0
"She always find funny things from her activities to share with everyone, So my sister is a outgoing and kind girl."	I_S0
"Thus, doing favorite activities can help children build a temperate personality."	E_S0
"In the second place, if children can do whatever they want, they will expand their horizon, This is qwing to the fact that children are able to do things they like, they will be more willing to obtain more skills, which contributes to enlarge their knowledge."	S_M0
"Therefore, children will absorb more knowledge from their favorite activities."	B_S0
"For instance, my brother likes travelling, so his parents always take him to travel around the world, diring travelling the world, brother viewd a lot of culture and local conditions,and then, he took his views into his dairy."	I_S0
"Finally, his diary obtain the second reward in HUBEI province."	I_S0
"So children do thier favorite things can enlarge their knowldge."	E_S0
"All in all, doing the activites that children like will be beneficial for them,"	O

"Without efficient treatment methods, we powerless human beings would be intruded by bad-mentioned virus and easily got seriously ill."	B_S0
"Just looking back to what our ancestors were confronted with."	I_S0
"At internal periods, thousands of innocent people died from fatal 
illnesses in absence of accurate medical treatment, in which there were large numbers of young children and pregnant women."	I_S0
"To minimize the the occurance rate of tragedies, we have no choices but to go on improving the medical care."	E_S0
"On top of that, satisfying healthcare system is the bedrock of any other causes we are pursuing for."	S_M0
"Only in the state of being healthy can people from different walks concentrate large portion of their energy and passion in their vocation and daily life."	B_S1
"It is meaningless even if someone is on top of his career pursuation or embrace a high- quality life in consequence of dramatic physical pain."	E_S1
"However,we must also adimit that the drawbacks of further enhancing physical treatment is here to solve."	S_M0
"After the rate of successful treatments soars, less attention is likely to be paid to individual health,not to mention the advocated regular diet habits and physical exercise."	B_S0
"In addition, elaborate treatments lead to the broadth of the gap between the wealth and the poor."	I_S0
"Exortervant charge for medical care keeps itself from individual with low salary, resulting in the insulation from the benefits."	E_S0
"Considering these factors,nonetheless, it is fortunate to say the overall improvement of out medical care system still cover the poor men,if not to fully sollve the physical problems for them."	B_C0
"Furthermore, we can see the double development in the system-building and the health consciousness in citizens."	I_C0
"Therefore, I tend to say despite the negative effects, nowadays medical care betters us to a large extent."	E_C0
 
"Many young student are leaving schools with negative thoughts on study."	S_T0
"I don't actually sure the main reason of the phenomenon."	B_S0
"Maybe because they believe that the knowledge that they learn in school can't help them on work or even in daily life."	I_S0
"So they give up study after getting job."	I_S0
"I believe that there is no limit in study."	I_S0
"It is a good habit to go to the library and to read some book which I interested in or it is about some thing I don't  know at all."	I_S0

"The animals and plants get used to the life in the past, however, the extinction of the biology destroys the food chain of nature, the rest part of them do not know how to find new kind of food to eat, in addition, they all die out in the end."	S_S2
"So it would have a butterfly effect, some of them are starving, and others might do not have the enemy after, the numbers of them would be much increasing in a short time."	S_M0
"The whole ecosphere would be chaos which are changing a lot."	B_S1
"It would cause serious environmental problems, and effect all the lives on earth that is too difficult to find ideas to bring it all back."	E_S1

"But several years before, we used our items carefully and would be sad if it broke."	S_T1
"So it is obvious that the main reason of this change is that we are now living in a world where we won't worry about life, we have the room for wasting things casually."	S_M0
"In conclusion,Life is much easier than it used to be,so some of us begin to waste things."	S_S2
"There is no doubt that this thought,which we can through things only a short time after used, will have bad influence to both our life and our society."	B_M0
"For the people who "throw away",it is a big waste for him that the money is used unwisely."	E_M0

"In our real life, we can see many beggars on the road to beg  for many reason:he doesn't have enough many for the ticket to go home;he just lost his wallet or he dosen't eat for 3 days....."	E_I0
"These situations are more and more common in our life,especially in the center of city."	S_T0
"I saw this situation in last week too."	S_M0
"When I was at the station of ZHONGSHAN Park,a man talked to me and asked for some many to buy the ticket."	B_S0
"I asked him where he want to go,and bought a ticket for him."	I_S0

"He was still begging for money."	B_S1
"At that time,I was so disappointed and angry----He had just cheated me,I was so stupid that I didn't realized he just want money, not the ticket."	E_S1

"They might not really the struggling people,they don't need helps at all and they just ask for money."	B_S0
"At first, I think many people like me, want to help them."	I_S0

"However,nowadays,we still can receive news from the television or newspaper that a large number of people died because they didn't have anything to eat."	I_S0
"In this essay,I will illustrate the cause and discuss about how this issue might be solved."	I_S0
"When it comes to the cause of hunger,the first thing comes to my mind is the lack of sources of food."	I_S0
"Due to the differences in climate or location,some areas in this planet are not suitable for growing crops,which means this area will lack the food production,in this case,the best way to get food is to inport the food from other countries where the food is overproduced."	I_S0
"However,what if the government in those area lacks funds for it then barely other country is willing to send them food for free."	I_S0
"so for the solution,I supose there are two ways to go."	I_S0
"One way is to appeal the international organization or the charity to gather money or send food for those poor areas."	I_S0
"The other way is to ask for the favor from the countries which are more advanced in agriculture,if they can provide more advanced technology or send experienced farmers to help them grow crops in their land,then hopefully the poor area may be enable to support themselves with the harvest."	I_S0
"In conclusion,on the earth,everyone is born to be equal,it's the moralty to give a hand to those people who are still suffering from hunger,especially those more advanced countries and their governments should make efforts,although we have charities and organizations,but we know that's far from being enough for the hungry people."	I_S0
"All in all,there is still a lot of solutions which can be found,we will study more and will solve the problem in the future."	E_S0

"Reasons are following."	E_T0
"First of all,we are not saints and we can not be free from faults."	S_M2
"Therefore,parents have the reason to give their children chances to make mistakes."	B_S0
"Besides,only when we have exprienced ourselves can we get a lesson."	I_S0
"Nobady else can take our place."	I_S0
"For children,helpful advice from parents is less useful than their own experience."	I_S0
"There is an old saying in China,"Turn back untill hit the south wall.""	I_S0
"Thus it can be seen that parents should let their children hit the south wall."	I_S0
"Finally,facing problems and making mistakes is a shortcut way for children to improve independentability."	E_S0
"In summary,I agree with the statement that let children make misakes and let them learn from their own mistakes."	S_C2

"The pie charts illustrate how much money a certain UK school spent on various aspects in three particular years, which includes 1981, 1991 and 2001."	B_S0
"The cost of teachers' salaries ranked first in 1981, which then  experieced a fluctuation, with the proportion of that climbing from 40% to 50% in the first decades, followed by a 5% decline from then on."	I_S0
"Similarly, standing at 15%, the ratio taken by the expenditure on resources like books soared, reaching the peak at 20% in 1991, with a plummet to 9% followed by."	I_S0
"The cost of funiture and equipment, however, showed a opposite trend, where there was a slump at the beginning, which declined from 15% to 5% in the 1981-1991 period until a more than four-fold shoot-up could be witnessed."	I_S0
"In contrast, turning to the spending on other worker's salaries and insurance, the shift tendency is more stable."	I_S0
"The proportion of other staff's salaries decreased from 28% in 1981 to 22%in 1991, finally reaching the bottom (15%) in 2001."	I_S0
"As for the insurance, interestingly, although there was a four-fold growth in the percentage of that, it was still the part that school attached least importance to."	I_S0
"Overall, the money spent on salaries, which namely means the salaries of teachers and that of other workers, contributed the majority of total school spending in this three-decade period."	E_S0
 
"Agnostids were a group of marine animals that became extinct about 450 million years ago,Agnostid fossils can be found in rocks in many areas around the world
for witering ,firstthe agnostids may have been free-swimming predators that hunted smaller animals."	S_T1
"It is known that other types of primitive arthropods were strong swimmers and active predators."	B_S0
"for listing is do not agree ,this think
second,for writeing,they may have dwelled on the seafloor."	I_S0
"Again, there are examples of other types of primitive arthropods living this way."	I_S0
"but listening think
third,the witening think there is the possibility that the agnostids were parasites, living on and feeding off larger organisms."	I_S0
"and the listening do not agree
so,There are several different theories about how agnostids may have lived."	E_S0
 
"I'm afraid I have to say I disagree with this statement ."	B_I0
"Personally I always find physical exercise more relaxing than watching a movie or reading a book ."	I_I0
"I wouldn't like relaxing by watching or reading;they are both consuming tasks ."	I_I0
"I have to take in information ,process it and argue about it ."	I_I0
"When reading books information is provided by means of words ;when watching movies ,by videos and audios ."	I_I0
"All ways require me to combine and compare the information given right now with the information I have absorbed in previously ,which calls for full-load usage of my brain ."	I_I0
"This can hardly be seen as 'relaxing' ."	I_I0
"Moreover ,for us students we are daily dealing with books ,which again makes the idea of  relaxing by reading books less reasonable ."	E_I0
"I would prefer relaxing by doing physical exercises ."	S_M2
"Running ,rope skipping ,muscle trainings ,swimming ,or even ball games ,they all sound great when it comes to relaxing ."	B_S1
"Of course exercising means you have to deal with problems like panting for breath ,sore musles (or even a sore throat),sweat all over your skin ,and some other unmentioned problems ,yet they simply can't conceal the fact that physical exercise is a great way to save one's mind from heavy mental pressures ."	E_S1
"Scientists have found that physical exercises ,regardless of which type of exercise you choose ,will help your body secrete hormones that can lift the stones of your mind ."	S_C2
"Of course ,watching movies or reading books may also be helpful for relaxing ,for example ,if you choose sitcoms ,or other materials that do not require much consideration of problems you might encounter in the books or movies ,yet this doesn't mean processing with the information is not a consuming task ;it still is ."	B_S1
"With this in mind ,I guess I would prefer watching movies or reading books when I seriously wish to think over the topic ,instead of seeing it as a choice of mentally relaxing ."	E_S1

"Nowadays more and more parents offer extrem love to their children."	B_I0
"And some parents offer their school-age children money for high grade."	E_I0
"From my perspective, it's not a good idea."	B_T0
"My reasons and examples are as following."	E_T0
"First, there are many ways for parents to praise their children when they get high grade in school."	S_M1
"It's not a good way that offering school-age children money."	B_S0
"School-age children are too young to have the ability to spend those money well."	I_S0
"If they spend those money incorrectly, like spending money on games, it's not good for them study well."	I_S0
"Parents can offer their children something else, such as watching movies, buying them gifts, encouraging."	E_S0
"Also, it's not a good idea that offer money for each high grade."	S_M1
"Parents can offer gifts depending on children's progress in their study."	B_S0
"Besides, high grade is not a standard criterion for awards."	I_S0
"If children have done something that they never did, parents can encourage them."	E_S0
"Admittedly, it's a idea for parents to offer money for high grade their children get in school, but it's not a good idea."	B_C0
"In a nutshell, there are other methods for parents to offer their children and high grade is not equal to awards."	I_C0
"So my opinion is offering school-age children money for high grade is not a good idea."	E_C0
 
"As we can see from the chart, the school expense in 1981 and 1991, has not changed greatly."	B_I0
"Teacher's salaries have been alway the great part of expense."	I_I0
"In addition, the resources such as books have been increased slightly,which meant puplics have applied inportance to it."	E_I0
"However, in the spending in 2001,the output of furniture and equippment is greatly rising."	S_M2
"In contrast, the expense of resources is declining."	B_S1
"In the meanwhile, teacher's salaries are sa the same as before."	E_S1
"In the end, we can draw the conclusion that parents and school are paying much attention to the environment of study for providing a good atmosphere for the children."	S_S2
 
"With the development of people's awareness about the importance of education, more and more parents pay enormous efforts to search for variable methods to improve their children's grades."	S_I0
"In my opinion, however, awarding children money for each high grade they obtain in school is not a beneficial way to motivate the children."	S_T0
"First of all, offering children money when they get good grades will give them a sense that they are studying for money rather than knowledge."	S_M0
"It's not advantageous for their long-period development."	B_S0
"If children are motivated by the desire for money instead of curiosity to the world, they will probably form a money-oriented value, which in fact preventing them from establishing mental soundness."	I_S0
"It will be more likely that they are driven by the stress to grasp wealth when they enter adulthood."	E_S0
"Furthermore, children may spend the money carelessly, which prevents them from forming a right economic value."	S_M0
"For instance, my father often rewarded me with a lot of pocket money for my good grades when I was in primary school."	B_S0
"As a small child at that age, I had no consideration about planning to spend the money meaningfully."	I_S0
"Therefore, I never saved the money and bought anything I want without thinking about the price."	I_S0
"When my father found that I bought lots of useless commodities and toys, he decided to cease awarding me money and required me to learn to control my expenditures."	E_S0
"Last but not least, giving children money for high grades prevents them from challenging themselves."	S_M0
"They are possibly satisfied when they are rewarded for an "A" on the exam paper and stop working hard to get more acheivements."	B_S1
"Only when they are required at a higher level will they be motivated to imrove themselves to be better."	E_S1
"In a word, offering children money won't be a good choice, since it may cause alot of problems and do harm to children's growth."	S_C2
 
"I disagree that it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise."	B_T0
"In my opinion, we all have our own ways to relax,and we can not easily say that this way is better than the other."	I_T0
"Different people have different habits, so we need to find the most suitable way for ourselves rather than the best way which said by other person."	E_T0
"For example, someone used to relax by doing physical exercise,because he/she lkes playing sports."	S_M2
"Maybe he/she thinks that he/she can easily
fall in sleep after exercise so that he/she can get the best relaxing."	B_S0
"But others don not think so, they would rather have a good rest just like watching a movie or reading a book than do some exercise."	I_S0
"Maybe doing exercise make them more tired."	I_S0
"So how we can straightly say that it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise?"	I_S0
"Therefore,we just need to find the most suitable way for ourselves to relax."	E_S0
"All in all, I can not support that it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise."	S_C2
"Maybe I can relax by doing physical exercise ,and you can not."	B_S1

"Where is the best place for children to be good members in this society became a controversial issue these days."	S_T1
"Some people hold the view that parents have the responsibility to cultivate their children, while others think school should educate these children."	S_T0
"It is no doubt that parents, are the first teachers of their children, they do have spend some time to teach their children how to respect others, follow the rules of these society, as well as raise their moral standards."	S_M1
"In addition, children always like follow even imitate their parents, which means parents should notice their own behaviour and language."	B_S1
"What's more, parents should pay attention to their children's behaviour, for instance, adjust or modify their children's behaviour when they did something wrong."	E_S1
"For certain, in most of countries or general family, children stay at their school for entire day, therefore the people they spend most time with are definitely their teachers and their peers."	S_M1
"In other words, children will experience studying even living with people from a whole diversity of backgrounds from the wider society."	B_S0
"This experience should teach them how to co-operate and share with each other and how to contribute to the life of their community."	I_S0
"So the school should teach children how to be good members."	E_S0
"In conclusion, for children, they should not only learn how to respect others, elders and abide by the rules of the society, but also learn how to integrate into the society and people around them harmoniously."	S_C2
"Therefore, both schools and parents are essential to educate children how to grow up into a good person."	S_S2
 
"Nowadays, some parents award their kids with money for good marks their children win at school."	B_I0
"Whether it is a good idea is under the debate."	I_I0
"I firmly believe that high grade should never be equal to money."	I_I0
"If children receive money only because of their acdamic performance at school, they may regard the purpose of studying as to win money and awards in a quick way."	I_I0
"Hence they will underestimate other virtues they ought to poccess."	E_I0
"What is more, acdamic perfomances may not win them awards and fame in their future carrer if they are involved in the field of science."	B_T0
"There is potensial risk that they will spare no means to accelerate this process, which can sometimes be illegal."	E_T0
"Also, it is essencial that a child should learn that he is studying for himsilf rather than anyone else."	S_M1
"If he only works for awards in his childhood, he will feel confused in the future when he finds that there are no longer clear goals."	B_S1
"This is the inevitable consequence of wrong education."	E_S1
"Some people may argue that award children with monry can motivate children to work harder effienctly."	S_M1

"Money may work now, but the trick won't last long."	I_S0
"At a young age, we should urge children to go through the experinces which are eccential."	I_S0
"Or it will pay back in the long term."	E_S0
"Overall, right parenting is of great importance."	B_C0
"While parents are focusing on the good grade their children get, they should also pay attention to their children's psychological development."	I_C0
"Kids need to gain their self-assessment and goals for lifetime through experinces anmd frustrations."	I_C0

"About recycling household garbage"	S_S2
"Now garbage collection is a big problem in the world."	B_I0
"Nowdays,the global environmental situation is severe,and garbage sorting and recycling is imminent."	I_I0
"Despite this,people's recycling awareness is not strong."	E_I0
"In my opinion,it is very necessary to promote the recycling of garbage to the legal level."	S_T0
"First of all, I think the law can give people restraint and draw a boundary in their hearts."	S_M0
"For example,in 2019,the garbage classification first implemented by Shanghai has achieved remarkable results."	B_S1
"According to the law,those who do not abide by the rules will be fined and detained, and schools and work units are promoting the relevant knowledge of garbage classification and facilitating the recycling of relevant personnel because of the implementation of garbage recycling classification by the whole people."	E_S1
"Secondly,the state can take the lead in more standardized implementation of laws."	S_M0
"With standards and rules,it will be easier and more convenient to implement."	S_S2
"All in all, I think it's far more benefical than harmful to raise garbage recycling by category to law."	S_M0
"Also looking forward to the law can be more perfect on stage implementation."	S_S2
 
"The passage and the lecture have a discussion on how to protect the frog species."	B_I0
"In the lecture, the professor casts doubt on the reading passage's solutions that they are not practical."	I_I0
"He thinks that a solution should be include many practical aspect, like the fair between very farmers and so on, which contradicts the reading states."	E_I0
"First, even though the reading passage suggests that it is a efficient way to protect frogs by setting the law to prohibited the farmers from using pesticides for some certain farmers near the frog populations, the professor argues in the lecture that it is not economical fair."	S_M0
"Because the farmer who lives near the frog need to using less pesticides, leading that the more crops may be harmed, which makes they are disadvantageous comparing to others."	S_S2
"Moreover, despite the statement in the reading that using antifungal medication and treatments on a large scale to protect sensitive frog from infection, the professor contends that the treatments can be applied on a large scale due to the high cost of needing of applying on every single frogs."	S_M0
"Then he posts another that the fungal can be passed into next generation again and again."	B_S1
"While the treatments can't stop that."	E_S1
"Finally, the professor asserts that the waste water poured by human is not the biggest threaten comparing to the author's solution, which calling on protecting the water habitats."	S_M0
"It is said in the lecture the Greenhouse effect is the biggest problem for frogs."	B_S0
"The greenhouse effect is a weapon that kills many species in this planet."	I_S0
"So it will be more important to discovery a way to reduce the greenhouse effect."	E_S0
 
"The article points out that prescribed burns conducted by forestry services have many bad effects, while the speaker disagrees with this for following reasons."	B_I0
"Firstly, the article says it will have a large impact on wildlife, but the speaker believes that few animals will get killed."	E_I0
"For example, birds can easily fly away thus such burns have little disturbence to them."	S_T1
"Besides, though it will destroy the home animal survive, since there are enormous forests, it is not difficult, for those animals, to find a new shelter."	S_M0
"In this way, prescribed burns affects little to animal's home."	S_S2
"In addition, the article also states that prescribed burns also pollute the air, which the speaker doesn't oppose."	S_M0
"However, comparing to the influence leading by big fire, the speaker believes that such pollution is a necessary cost, and the benefits it brings make up with such small costs."	S_S2
"Last but not the least, the passage thinks that forest fire often bypass the burned areas and spread to other places instead, which is argued against by the speaker."	S_M0
"The speaker shows up the fact that when doing prescrible burns, officials always monitor the burn and take caution of the near area."	B_S0
"If there is a threate to the near forests, they will take action as soon as possible."	I_S0
"In this way, such suppose made by the article won't happen."	E_S0
"All in all, that's why the speaker are on the opposite side of the article for the reasons it releases are not convincing."	S_C2
 
"There has been a heated debate whether some vegetables and fruits need to be transported by airplane."	B_T1
"Some people think transporting by plane are reasonable while others disagree this way."	E_T1
"In my opinion, I personally believed air transport is a good way to deliver vegetables."	S_T0
"Admittedly, some supporters who disagree transporting vegetables by plane have a view that that way is too luxurious for most residents, and may cause air pollution to some extent."	S_M1
"However, it is an unreasonable view as it exaggerate the situation."	B_S0
"Only a few vegetables which is cannot be produced by the local places can be delivered by airplanes, so the process cannot produce many air pollution."	I_S0
"Besides, the main source of air pollution is the huge mount of private cars and harmful gases produced by chemical factories instead of the plane."	I_S0
"Therefore, it dose not make sense to say air pollution caused by transporting fruits by airplane."	E_S0
"On the other hand, some bakers who agree this way may have an opinion that delivering by airplane is the fastest way and can keep the flavor of vegetables and fruits which cannot be store for a long time."	S_M1
"In other words, the production transported by plane have a higher quality and a better taste."	B_S0
"In my view, I think that is right to some extent."	I_S0
"Moreover, it could give the city dwellers more choices to satisfy their demand."	I_S0
"As a result, dwellers are more likely to have an adequate structure of nutrition which may improve their healthy level."	E_S0
"In conclusion, I personally believe that it is a good way to transport vegetables and fruits by airplane."	B_C1
"We should encourgae this way because the advantages is more than the disadvantages."	E_C1
 
"The problem of wasting is more and more serious in recent years."	B_I0
"Some people believe that only the government can decrease waste by making laws to force people to do the recycle."	E_I0
"In my opinion, it is not suitable to take this method."	S_T0
"Firstly, people may feel uncomfortable to obey the law about recycle."	S_M1
"It is a benefit for people to know the meaning of doing recycle rather than give them a law to force them to allow it."	B_S1
"If people know how recycling can help to protect the environment, they will more likely to do it by themselves."	E_S1
"Secondly, laws cannot cover all the aspects of waste-reduce."	S_M1
"Home waste, industrial waste and water waste 
Besides that, laws cannot give individual effective punishment."	B_S1
"Only big companies and industries can receive the punishment which can reduce waste."	E_S1
"For that reason, it is useless to set"	O
 
"In recent days,there was a heated topic that whether economic development should be puted in the prior mission of the government."	S_I0
"As time goes by,this topic has triggered more and more discussions."	S_T1
"The was a well-known quote“The foundation of finance will decide to the construction of
upstairs ",which means,ecomomic is the basis of different kinds of work or entertainment."	S_M1
"Without enough budget, governemts may not finish some constuctions of the cities,and citizens can not enjoy the services from the new faclities."	B_S0
"Most importantly,the budget is coming from tax revenue."	I_S0
"So，that's why the government focus on economic development and desire to witness a increase trend continuously."	E_S0
"On the other hand,with the transformation of social atiitute,a group of residents will pay more attentions to health-care or other aspects of life."	S_M1
"Because in such a fast rhythm life style,people are regularlly lack of rest and suffer from a lot of diseases espeically the pain on the neck and shouldes."	B_S1
"They are more likely taking better care of themselevs rather than earning higher salaries."	E_S1
"To sum up,both opinions of this topic from two sides are reasonable."	B_C1
"But I totally agree with that economic is still the initial part of governments work."	E_C1
"With this foundation,other aspects also can be gradually improved at the same time."	S_S2

"It is known to people that family has a powerful influence on children's life,also the influence outside from home is a bigger part for children's development."	S_I0
"Therefore, I am disagree with the indication that the life outside from family has greater impact for children."	S_T1
"Firstly,famliy education has a great impact on the psychological and physological of children's groth."	S_M1
"From ,the physiological aspect, the family provides the child's life material foundation,influences the child's growth and development,establishes the child's life habit and so on."	B_S0
"From the psychological aspect,the famliy guides the child's future outlook on life."	I_S0
"Children's character,consiciousness and tastes are all acquired from their parents and are the result of family education."	E_S0
"By contrast,the influence of extermal environment is also present."	S_M1
"For example,when your child's friends like to go to the Internet bar to play computer games,then your children must think about this things everyday and maybe will delay the sthdy,while when his friends are good students who love learning ,that your child will be interested in learning."	B_S1
"Bust the influence of external environment on children can be corrected thouth the family."	E_S1

"In most of time,people must study to cooperate each other and"	E_S1
 
"I think the children from 5 to 10 should take one hour-long class and then have a rest or play some games."	B_T1
"There are two points to explain this idea."	E_T1
"First of all,It will make people feel tried when they face high-level class."	S_M1
"Our brains all have some melt to control your brains and change them."	B_S0
"And if you attend the class for a long time."	I_S0
"Your brain will feel tried and then when you use brain to solve the problem."	I_S0
"The rote of solving the problem will discreasing."	I_S0
"For example,why the school will give some time for them when the class over."	I_S0
"This is in ord to make students relaxed and can make them attend next class quickly."	E_S0
"Second,it will afford the instrest of atteding class."	S_M1
"People all have time to study new knowledge,but when they study for a long time ,their's intreaste will discrease,and if you don't chatch their's intreaste,they will don't want to study knowledge."	B_S0
"For example,if you can make a choice."	I_S0
"One is attending 5 hours class,the other is atteding 1+1+1+1+1 class。It's mean that when have one hour class over will have ten minutes to relax."	I_S0
"I can sure that you will try the second."	I_S0
"Because long time study don't can make your instreate to improve and will make you feel nurvous."	I_S0

"So,it is helpful for you to study well."	B_C1
"If you want to have better grades than before you got,you can try it."	E_C1

"But some opposed in the camp that extra reasons definitely exist for learning a foreign language."	I_T1
"People who believe that the need of travelling and  working oversea is the only reason to study foreign languge base their ideas on two arguement."	E_T1
"What is worth mentioning first involves that mastering a foreign language facilitates people to live abroad."	B_S0
"With the development of international corporations, the standard of recruiting new employees has been reatively hign, which includes the requirement of foreign language's level."	I_S0

"If they can't speak foreign languge fluently, it will have difficulties in their daily life and even have a detrimental effect on their futire career."	I_S0
"Another reson is that, there is no need to learn foreign languge for other reasons in our hometown."	I_S0
"For example, when we intend to see a foreign film, we don't worry about whether we are able to understand what the actors say."	I_S0
"Because of the proffesional translator, the culture gaps have been dramatically narrow."	I_S0
"However, it is reasonable for some people who consider that it shouldn't be the only reason."	I_S0
"Undeniable, some people are really intersted in foreign culture and language."	I_S0
"Therefore , there is a possible for them to study foreign language only for their hobby instead of special purpose.."	E_S0
"To sum up, pondering over all these things, it is really hard for me to draw a certain conclusion."	S_M2
"As far as i concerned, travelling and working in other areas in the world is the primary reason for people to learn foreign language."	S_S2

"Many cities around the world have succeeded in doing so, providing passengers with bus transport to the city centre if necessary."	B_S0
"During the rush hour, the government can also carry out activities to encourage people to reduce their dependence on cars."	I_S0
"Obviously, many people drive very short distances to supermarkets or local schools."	I_S0
"These are often unnecessary, but automatic entry into our car is not considered."	E_S0
"Obviously, we all have a responsibility to take good care of our city."	S_C2

"Some people maintain that it is beneficial to share relevant information as much as possible in significant fields."	S_I0
"Others believe that some information is too precious to share for free."	B_T0
"Both sides have their reasons, but I personally advocate that scientific research, academia and business can benefit enormously if information is shared."	E_T0
"Scientific research relies heavily on available data and previous findings."	S_M1
"If valuable information and past discoveries are not shared publicly with scholars and researchers, the progress of the world will come to a standstill."	B_S0
"The Internet is probably the most essential invention the modern world has produced, and if the technology hadn't been shared us military, we might still be living in a pre-internet age."	I_S0
"Moreover, information is worthless for scientific research if it cannot be applied to the real world."	I_S0
"So limiting them is like killing the possibility of progress."	I_S0
"In the meantime, the history of the world proves that man has made progress by sharing discoveries and inventions with the world, thanks to all discoveries have been greatly modified and improved."	I_S0

B_S0
"Move to ther other side, the developmenrt of the other types is equally important to the country,such as education ,goverment should increase efforts to improve the teaching enviroment and teaching metgod , For example China stiil have lot of poor area and poor villges ,there kids can not receive better education like city kids ,because of the better education,make better economy ,
for the country,this is also important like economy."	I_S0
"To sum up, I think other types of progress are equally impotant for a country, the power of a nation is not onlyecomomic."	E_S0
 
"I choose televison,books and radio to compare."	S_I0
"Firstly, the televison has so many advantages."	S_M0
"Many family have televison so the information can be spread."	B_S0
"Watching televison is good for people to receive information by both eyes and ears,then information can be remembered longer."	I_S0
"The disadvantages also assist, people can not exchange their feelings with others and people in televison."	I_S0
"And the information reported in the televison always be influenced by policy sometimes maybe lose the objectivity."	E_S0
"Secondly,about the books."	S_M0
"The biggest advantage of books is books can keep the information longer,books usually be thinked as a media which brings truth."	B_S0
"Meanwhile, books can be taken easliy so people can borrow them from others,turn down the cost of receiving infomation."	I_S0
"However,the information in books don't have too time-sensitive,and the books writers' standerd aren't fit."	E_S0
"Thirdly,about the radio."	S_M0
"The radio's advantage and disadvantage have many same sides with televison,however,the radio can only be listened."	B_S0
"That give the confidence to people who are driving the car or have an eye disease."	I_S0
"Also,radio can't give people the eye feeling,it is the disadvantage comparing with the televison."	E_S0
"Although these three medias all great and suitable for different people,I think televison is the most effective."	S_M0
"The first reason is,televison has the widest audiences."	B_S0
"For my famliy's example,my grandparents can't read Chinese words,they can't receive information from books."	I_S0
"Nowadays most of Chinese families have bought televison and radio gradually becomes out of style,only be heard when people driving the car."	I_S0
"Also,people can choose the televison channel which they really like but nowadays radio channels are limited and most of them play music everyday."	I_S0
"What's more,televison can express information to the whole word,but radio can only bring information to a city or a province."	E_S0
"Above all, I think televison is the most effective media than books and radio."	S_C2

"From the graph, we can see that the numbers of UK visitors going abroad and overseas tourists to Britain both ascended steadily, with the former well surpassing the latter in terms of the incrase margin."	S_M0
"In the meantime, among all the other countries in the world, Britons were apparently more inclined to visit their European neighbors."	S_S2
"From the graph, we learn that the  numbers of visitors going out and coming in 1979 were very close,both around  10 million."	S_M0

"That is an important part of you trip."	I_S0
"Some famous tourist attraction is worth to have a look ,but we can see it in the picture and the intenet."	I_S0
"The local customs are not the same, you can hardly feel it at home."	I_S0
"Only when you go there and experience it,  can you catch them really."	I_S0
"When I go abroad ,the first thing i did is to make some local friends and talk to them ,I will share some custom to them ,and they still can tell something with me, and bring me to their home to eat some local food and doing some local activities."	I_S0
"So why you keep your own habits,costoms and behaviors."	I_S0
"And still each country has thier own law, if we keep your own costoms and behaviors, it may violate local laws."	E_S0
 
"In my opinion,it is a regret to have so many languages disappearing."	S_T1
"Every language carries a specific culture,a colorful history,and a delicate feeling."	B_S0
"They are all treasures of our humanbeings."	I_S0
"There are  many kinds of languages have disspppeared,such as Hittite,Tocharian,Macedonian,Sumerian,Ancient Egyptian, Luwian..."	I_S0
"There are also many languges are facing the dilemma of disappearance,such as Jeru,Khomani,Ainu,Thao..."	I_S0
"Among those languages,some have 10 or 20 users,and some only have several users."	I_S0
"What does than mean?"	I_S0
"It means that,after 30 years,even shorter,the stories of one generation will be covered by the dust of the history."	I_S0
"When our children are interested in the stories of them one day,we even can not find the evidence to confirm the existence of that person."	I_S0
"Fortunately,as I know,some countries have taken  measures to save these invisable fortune--Japan,is deveted to resurgeing the language and the culture of Ainu, and other countries also take a positive attitude toward it."	I_S0
"I think,in the near future,there will be more and more people realizing the importance of a certain language,and our lives will become more colorful at the same time."	E_S0
 
"The two charts illustrate the changes in the amount of Japanese tourists traveling abroad and the proportion of the Australia's market during 1985 and 1995."	S_I0
"During the whole period,the proportion has increased about 3 times."	B_T1
"From 1985 to 1990 ,it increased every year from about 5 millions to 11 millions."	I_T1
"However,after 1990 it experience a slight decrease for one year and kept stable for about 2 years from 1991 to 1993."	I_T1
"After the four years' stability it began to increase in 1994 and finally grow up to nearly 16 millions."	E_T1
"The proportion of  Australia shows a similar trend."	S_M2
"From 1985 to 1988 it increased from 2 percent to 5 percent."	B_S0
"But after 1988 it decreased nearly 0.5 percent in one year."	I_S0
"After the one year's decrease it continue to rise  for about 5 years and rose the top in 1994 and break 6 percent(about 6.1 percent)."	I_S0
"But in 1995 ,it slightly dropped to 6 percent."	E_S0
 
"Nowadays, people can purchase all kings of goods from other countries easily, which may make people in different countries lead similar life."	S_T1
"From my perspective, it is a positive trend."	S_T0
"First, being able to buy the same products anywhere in the world means that we can choose products that we prefer or of high quality."	S_M1
"For example, we all know that make-up made by South Korea and watches made by Switzerland are very popular around the world, so we can buy them even if we are not in South Korea or Switzerland, which can improve the quality of our life."	B_S1
"Although that leads to similarity of countries, it makes our life better."	E_S1
"In addition, buying the same products is a way to exchange different kinds of cultures."	S_M1
"For example, when we buy Sushi or the Imperial Guard, we are willing to learn more about their meanings and background, so we can know more about Japanese culture."	B_S1
"It seems that if we all buy the same goods, our countries look similar, but in fact it is just how we communicate with each other and enhance our understanding, which is very beneficial for the development of the whole world."	E_S1
"In summary, it is true that we can purchase and use the same goods in different countries and it makes us look similar, but definitely it can improve our life and benefit our cultural exchange, which can make us lead a better life."	S_C2
 
"In recent years, goverments attach more importance to public health."	S_T0
"it is argued that the best way to improve public health is by providing more sports facilities."	B_S0
"on the other hand, some people believe that this is an inefficient activity and other measures and suggestions are required."	I_S0
"My personal view is that increasing sports facilities is a feasible approach but not the best way."	I_S0
"Sports facilities can provide good places to exercise for people."	I_S0
"When people are bored because of their work, most of them may choose to go to the gym or other places where they can do sports."	I_S0
"If there are more facilities are offered, people are more likely to have daliy exercise in leisure time."	I_S0
"It is a good way to keep healthy and release the stress."	I_S0
"However, not everyone likes doing sports."	I_S0
"For instance, students have less time to have the rest due to their heavy schoolwork."	I_S0
"Moreover, the old do not know how to do physical exercise."	I_S0
"However, there are some better ways of trackling these problems."	I_S0
"Firstly, the government can provide more hosptals near communities."	I_S0
"In that case, an increasing number of residents may enjoy the medical sevices and it is also quite convinent for them."	I_S0
"Apart from that, governments also can give subsidies or collect less taxs from local health centers."	I_S0
"Then, the health centers will set lower price to provide services."	I_S0
"At last, some regulatins would be made to offer free vaccines to people every year in order to prevent dieases."	I_S0
"in conclusion, governments can use more effective ways to improve public health, not just increasing the number of sports facilities."	E_S0
 
"In recent tears,many young students are leaving schools with negative  thoughts on studying."	S_T0
"I think there are two reasons for this condition."	S_T1
"First,I think the school should be blamed for this."	B_S0
"Students stay in school for a long time in a day."	I_S0
"If the school in a place they loves very much,they won't leave school."	I_S0
"On the other sides,if students think the class is boring or they can't learn anything at all,of course,they wants to leave school."	I_S0
"Second,I think the family education in important,too."	I_S0
"For example,if in a family,father,mather ahd sister are all like read and talking about the knowledge they have learned,the brother will like to study in all probability."	I_S0
"The parents can tell their children it is benefit to them by themselves."	I_S0
"It will be more useful compare to the teacher who teach them in school."	I_S0
"And according to the reasons, I think we can do around the following two sides."	I_S0
"First,the school should explore different styles of class,in order to make them more interesting and attractive."	I_S0
"If the old style of having class makes students feel boring,the school should change their styles."	I_S0
"Second,the faminy should make a good example for their children."	I_S0
"Good behaior begins from early."	I_S0
"the early the students know the benefit of study,the more they like stay in school."	I_S0
"Last but noy least,education is important to a people's life,so I think our society should think about this condition and do something to change this."	E_S0
 
"The graph below shows how the units of electricity production changed by fuel source in Australia and Fiance over 2 decades."	S_I0
"The amount of coal rose to 130 units , making up the largest part of total production in Australia in 2000 while it only made up a half of total production in 1980."	S_M1
"The amount of oil always remained the smallest part of total production in Australia, decreasing to 2 units from 1980 to 2000."	S_S2
"At the meanwhile, the amount of that increased by 5 units in France over 2 decades."	S_M1
"The figures of nuclear powe witnessed an increase to 126 units , taking the biggest part of total production in 2000 in France."	B_S1
"The number of that was one fifth 20 years ago."	E_S1
"From the information above, Units of electricity by fuel source met a sharp decline of oil in both countries over 20 years."	S_S2
 
"I don't agree with this opinion very much."	S_T1
"Admittedly, someone considers language as a kind of trouble that wastes people's time to learn."	B_S0
"To some degree, we human-beings do spend thousands of time learning a second language or even our native language because languages are so complex and contain lots of things."	I_S0
"However we can never negelect the importance of languages when we find them difficult, for they observe the history of culture and represent the inner logic of a nation."	E_S0
"First of all, language  is a kind of precious culture, without which a nation couldn't form itself."	S_M2
"When a language dies out, the culture created in the long history that it belongs to disappears, leading to a significant loss of human."	B_S0
"What's more, language implies the inner logic of a nation, as a result learning a new language could provide a new broader view of life."	I_S0
"As more and more languages die out, we also lose some directions of looking at things."	E_S0
 
"Currently, a large amount of students would like to spare one gap year between the completion of study and the entrance for the university for travelling or working, which is considered necessary by some people."	S_T1
"However, it is not a proper behavior in my view."	B_S0
"The gap year could have an negative impact on the study of students."	I_S0
"Continuous study process would be broken."	I_S0
"The courses in the universtiy are related to the knowledge in senior high schools in most situations."	I_S0
"Students who has finished their mathematics in high school might forget it if spending a long time in the travelling or working without study."	I_S0
"And then the engineering course in the university would be hard for them."	I_S0
"However, some people argue that the gap year could enrich the social experience of students."	I_S0
"Most juniors would spend this year adapting themself to the complex society."	I_S0
"For instance, it could enable students to apply the theoretical knowledge to the practical experiences by looking for a job."	I_S0
"In contrast, the precious opportunity for practice is not accessible without this gap year."	I_S0
"Although the fact above, I would demonstrate that the gap year could not help a lot for students."	I_S0
"In general, juniors only spare one year for a job or a trip before the university, which would not achieve a great development to them because the time is too short."	I_S0
"Young people have to continue their study immediately when they just adapt to the training of a work."	I_S0
"To summarise, although there are some strengths for sparing a gap year, it is still reasonable and rational to attend the university directly after completing study in senior high school."	E_S0
 
"I think reckon that the first argument have some validity,while the second view is more resonable."	S_T0
"There is some truth in the first view, but it is too absolute."	S_M0
"Initially,we learn a foreign language probably because it is practical and its enavitable to use it as we go abroad."	B_S0
"Plus,If we want to study or work abroad, it is a must to learn the language of where we keen to go well."	I_S0
"However,Is that the only reason to learn a foreign language?"	I_S0
"Obsolutely no."	I_S0
"I cant subscribe to this idea."	I_S0
"Here are some reasons:"	E_S0
"First,some people will learn a foreign language in order to follow the idols."	S_M0
"For instance,a good friend of mine signed up for a Korean tutorial because she liked Korean stars so that she can be able to read Korean subtitles of the Korean TV programs."	B_S0
"So I think people can learn a language for the sake of the person they like."	I_S0
"And learning a foreign language can bring them closer to the person they adore."	E_S0
"Second,people can be desire to learn a foreign language simply because of its charm."	S_M0
"For example, I think French is very romantic, and French songs are very nice to listen to, and its tone is very interesting, so I want to learn some of them."	B_S1
"I fall in love with this language in terms of these ."	E_S1
"Frankly speaking,some people even learn languages just for spending their time."	S_M0
"My roommate doesn't have any other hobbies and this lead to hers hasing a lot of extra time."	B_S0
"Under such circumstances, she got the idea just in a flash that she can spend the free time by learning a foreign language."	I_S0
"On top of that,she discovered by chance that she had fallen in love with the language she was studying."	I_S0
"Its awesome to enrich ones life by doing this."	E_S0
"In conclusion,I frimly believe  that the reason why people learn foreign languages is not just for travel and work, people can learn a language purely  because of its charm and their hobbies."	S_C2
 
"The lecturer and reading passage hold completely different views toward the practice of salvage logging, which is the removal of dead trees from a forest after a fire or a storm."	B_I0
"The reasons are as follows."	E_I0
"To begin with, the reading suggests that removing old trees provides more space in which new generations of fresh trees can grow more healthily."	S_M0
"In contrast, the lecturer states that removing dead trees is not good for the health of a forest because it deprives it of the nutrients necessary for future tree growth, which dead trees release into the soil as they decompose."	S_S2
"Apart from from that, the assumption hold by reading passage is that only harmful insects."	S_M0
"It points out that clearing the forest of dead trees also destroying the habitat of these harmful insects, it ensures the healthy recovery of forest after a fire."	B_S0
"However, the speaker identifies its flaw that some insects and birds that inhabit dead trees are beneficial for trees' growth, and a few that are thought to be harmful have shown no evidence of causing significant damage to forest."	I_S0
"So salvage logging may cause unwanted damage to the forest in the long run."	E_S0
"The third opinion with regard to economic impact, the reading argues that this practice provides many industries with the wood necessary to sustain their production and offer employment opportunities to local people."	S_M0
"In contrasct, the lecturer argues against salvage logging because the dead trees can only be salvaged at a very high cost, and the employment assiciated with salvage logging is often temporary and taken by non-native residents."	S_S2
 
"In twenty-first century today, there are becoming more and more scientists and visitors coming to some places like Antarctic pole, which represents a stronger developing of humanity science."	S_T1
"However, the drawbacks of these scientic explorations are still can not be ignored."	B_S0
"From my perspective, the explorive activities like these are positive for everyone to participate in."	I_S0
"On the other hand, the explorers like scientists and visitors need to handle the extent of the activities."	I_S0
"To begin with the advantages of the exploration to nature, these activities benefit a lot to the whole human being."	I_S0
"As long as these explorations are keeping opening to the visitors and scientist, there would be  more improvements on earth science study."	I_S0
"For example, the visitors who have been there might share the research of local geographic information."	I_S0
"What's more is that those studies are also potentially influencing the quality of educations."	I_S0
"Just imagine how it encourages the student in university to explore the unknown land of the earth."	I_S0
"Now they have the chance to try to doing research in person instead of dong the lecture and report year over year."	I_S0
"However, the potencial crisis for the activities can not be ignored."	I_S0
"Especially for somewhere like Antarctic pole or North pole, the safe sercurity and the extent of testing are hard to be ensured."	I_S0
"On the one hand, there are no police and government in the wild, there must be many unknown crisis that can threaten visitors' life, which is contributed to the uncompleted safe sercurity."	I_S0
"On the other hand, whether to what extent those visitors doing their research, there will be more and more damages to the local environment."	I_S0
"Overall,"	E_S0
 
"As TV channel's programs are getting more and more, we can watch all kinds of programs, but it has directly led that the quality of each programs' is not high."	B_T1
"I think more programs are good for people  but it needs to improve."	E_T1
"There are some situation that can help to change the condition of TV programs."	B_S0
"Firstly, more TV programs means there are more choice."	I_S0
"For example, if I get bored in one program I won't have other choices, and more TV programs mean there is more information that can be played and we can know more information in every areas."	I_S0
"So I think more TV programs will lead to more information that we can know."	I_S0
"Secondly, more TV programs will be good for all kinds of people."	I_S0
"Such as, the interests of mine and my grandparents' is different, but if there is only one program it will not fit both my interests and my grandparents'."	I_S0
"It will decrease the amounts of people who watch TV."	I_S0
"Therefore, more TV programs are going to fit more interests of other groups of people."	I_S0
"Finally, the quality of each TV programs is very easy to be improved."	I_S0
"As we can see, we can add more team members who are good for making TV programs for each TV programs and we can increase the level of checking to prevent low qualities TV programs cannot be on the TV."	I_S0
"Thus, I think the quality of each TV programs can be improved quickly."	I_S0
"In conclusion, I think more TV programs will benefit more for most groups of people."	I_S0
"The qualities of TV programs can be improved easily, and I am sure that TV programs are going to be better and better."	E_S0
 
"The table provides data about the percentage of national consumer expenditure on different items in five different countries in 2002."	B_I0
"Turkey had the most demands in food, drinks and tobacco, accounting for 32.14%, followed by Ireland, which had 28.91% of its expenditure in this category."	I_I0
"The percentage of Italy, Spain and Sweden are 16.36%, 18.80% and 15.77% respectively."	E_I0
"Italian spent 9% of their money on  clothing and footwear, which proportion was the biggest in five countries."	S_M1
"The percentage of Ireland, Spain and Turkey were similar, at around 6.5%, while Sweden only had 5.4% of its expenditure in this category."	S_S2
"Turkey spent 4.35% on leisure and education, followed by Sweden and Italy, at 3.22% and 3.20% respectively."	S_M1
"Ireland spent 2.21% in this, and spain less than 2% in it."	S_S2
"In conclusion, every country's consumers spent most of their income on food, drinks, and tobacco, while they spend less on other two categories."	S_C2
 
"It is true that we do not recycle enough of our household waste."	S_T1
"Although I accept that new legislation to force people to recycle could help this situation, I do not agree that a recycling law is the only measure that governments should take."	S_T0
"In my view, a new recycling law would be just one possible way to tackle the waste problem."	S_M1
"Governments could make it a legal obligation for householders to separate all waste into different bins."	B_S0
"There could be punishments for people who fail to adhere to this law, ranging from a small fine to community service, or even perhaps prison sentences for repeat offenders."	I_S0
"These measures would act as a deterrent and encourage people to obey the recycling law."	I_S0
"As a result, the improved behaviour of homeowners could lead to a clean, waste-free environment for everyone."	E_S0
"However, I believe that governments should do more than simply introduce a recycling law."	S_M1
"It might be more effective if politicians put education, rather than punishment, at the centre of a recycling campaign."	B_S0
"For example, children could be taught about recycling in schools, and homeowners could be informed about the environmental impact of household waste."	I_S0
"Another tactic that governments could use would be to create stricter regulations for the companies that produce the packaging for household products."	I_S0
"Finally, money could also be spent to improve recycling facilities and systems, so that waste is processed more effectively, regardless of whether or not people separate it correctly in the home."	E_S0
"In conclusion, perhaps we do need to make recycling a legal requirement, but this would certainly not be the only way to encourage people to dispose of their waste more responsibly."	S_C2
 
"The plans provide the information on the development of the publlic when it opened in1920."	S_I0
"From both pictures, the entrance is the same without any change."	S_M1
"Seats have been removed and the rose garden converted into a coffee shop."	B_S0
"In 1920 the pond for water plants was also transformed into a children's play area."	I_S0
"But the rose garden on the left was preserved, and the seat beside it disappeared."	I_S0
"And in the middle of the pictures in 1920,we can see stage for musicians and fountain."	I_S0
"Now,they were became two new areas."	E_S0
"Today,On the far left,they have bulit a new amphitheatre for concerts."	S_M1
"A large semicircle forms its auditorium, while a small one becomes a stage."	B_S0
"And a big rose garden were surrounded by four seats now."	I_S0
"Similarly, in 1920 the lower left corner of the park, the garden and the seat, had disappeared, and there were no new improvements."	I_S0
"In addition, the glasshouse was became a water feature."	I_S0
"And they have a new entrance underground car park."	E_S0
 
"I think we should not only increase the number of sports facilities,but encourge people to do sport."	B_T0
"Firstly,increasing the number of sports facilities is very important."	I_T0
"Many people, especially the elderly, do not have enough daily training."	E_T0
"Increasing the number of sports equipment will help them exercise better, keep healthy and avoid diseases."	S_T1
"It can give us more opportunities to exercise."	B_T0
"Most of the time,people don't like to do sports because there are not more sports facilities."	E_T0
"Secondly, we should also enhance people's awareness of exercise and encourage them to go out for exercise."	S_M2
"Otherwise, no matter how much exercise equipment is added, it will not work."	B_S0
"Besides, we must take some other measures to encourage people to exercise."	I_S0
"For example, during holidays, low prices or free access to local gyms, swimming pools, and ski slopes can help increase citizens' enthusiasm for sports."	I_S0
"Let everybody know the importance of fitness through preaching and so on form, then taking physical exercise consciously ."	E_S0
"So I think if we want to improve public health, we need to not only increase the number of facilities, but also increase the awareness of fitness among citizens."	S_C2
"Besides, we can also encourage the public to go green, so as to both exercise and protect the environment."	B_S0
"I believe that only through their own practice, they will understand the importance of fitness and benefits."	I_S0
"When they feel their health improve through exercise, they will take the initiative to exercise."	I_S0
"This increase in sports facilities has had an effect."	I_S0
"So,I think we should not only increase the number of sports facilities,but encourge people to do sport."	E_S0
 
"It is believed that in a adverse circumstances, the best solution is to accept it."	B_T0
"While other people disagree that the best defense is to try to solve it."	E_T0
"From my perspective, I support the latter point of view."	S_T1
"Some people think it is a good way to try to accept a bad situation witch they are not satisfied with because people have to learn to compromise at the right time."	S_M1
"A lot of people sometimes have low points, such as not having enough money, or not having a satisfying job and so on."	B_S0
"But the success is accumulated by each adverse circumstance."	I_S0
"Because when people in the acceptance of not so ideal situation,  they will accumulate a lot of experience and precipitation of their patience and endurance."	I_S0
"Besides, success is not achieved in one step."	I_S0
"People should not be in a hurry to strive for perfection, resist and complain about their situation."	I_S0
"Instead, they should first accept the current situation with the right attitude, and then make changes step by step."	E_S0
"However, the others hold the opposite view that the best way to deal with the bad situations is to try and improve it because nothing pays off unless you work hard."	S_M1
"When people are in an adverse condition, what they should do is not simply to accept and comfort themselves, but to make efforts for the better."	B_S0
"Because any success is achieved through hard work."	I_S0
"Only by believing in themselves and daring to try that people can break through an insurmountable difficult situation."	I_S0
"And a mindset of always dare to trying is very important that if they never take any action, they can only stay where they are forever."	E_S0
"In conclusion, in an unsatisfactory situation, people need to break it through their own efforts, rather than simply accept it."	S_C2
 
"The three pie charts illustrate the transformation in annual spending on insurance, teachers' salaries, fumiture and equipment, resources and other worker's salaries by a certain UK school in 1981, 1991 and 2001."	S_I0
"It is shows that the percentage of teachers' salaries accounted for the highest of the total school spending, while the proportion of insurance made up for the lowest."	S_M1
"At the same thime, both of them increased from 1981 to 2001."	B_S0
"The former increased form 40% to 45% and it reach the peak at 50% in 1991."	I_S0
"In addition, the percentage of furniture and equipment also rose from 15% to 23% between two decades."	E_S0
"By the contrast, there was a dramatic decrease in the percentage of other workers' salaries from 28% in 1981 to 15% in 2001."	S_M1
"Meanwhile, this period also witnessed a sharp decline in the proportion of resources, from 15% to 9%."	S_S2
"In summary, although the proportion of teachers' salaries fluctuated during the two decades, it was still the highest percentage, which shows the importance of teachers in schools."	S_C2
 
"It is quite common these days for many people to leave company and have their own business."	B_I0
"I think there are some reasons that may account for this phenomenon."	I_I0
"To begin with, the pursuit of freedom and ambition motivate people to leave the traditional company."	I_I0
"On the one hand, with working for themselves, people can according their personal situations to arrange work time."	I_I0
"In the past, when people employed by a company, their time schedule followed the work path of company, and they hardly had time to visit friends and do exercise at any time."	I_I0
"On the other hand, workers’ ability gradually improve during the work, which help them to achieve their own dream in career."	E_I0
"As a result, many people quit their job and establish their own office."	S_T1
"There is no denying people can increase their income by being self-employed."	S_M2
"However, they will have a lot of difficulties in managing their own business."	B_S0
"Firstly, they need to take more responsibilities for the job, thus there are no paid holidays or sick leave for them anymore."	I_S0
"And people will fell stress under this model, which put threat in mental health."	I_S0
"In addition, compared to regular companies, those individual employers are quite unsteady."	I_S0
"Once the shortage of incomes occurs, the are hardly to survive."	I_S0
"Meanwhile, self-employed people should take more efforts to establish their reputation, which determines their scale of social resources."	E_S0
"To summarize, many people being self-employed due to the freedom of work time and their ambitions of career."	B_C1
"But there are some disadvantages should be considered."	E_C1
 
"I disagree with this opinion."	B_T0
"I think friends can influence us more in our daily life."	E_T0
"Because students meet friends in most of the time instead of any indivusual teacher, and students also like to talk or play with friends more."	S_T1
"Although teachers experience more than students and usually more knowlegeable to students, which should be very useful for students, students would still influenced by their friends more."	S_M1
"Because in most of the cases, teacher don't know the most true opinion of students, that makes some communications become difficult."	B_S0
"In other words, students are not willing to talk to teachers."	I_S0
"Also, teachers don't have much time to influence students other than teach knowledge."	I_S0
"Of course, teachers would infulence students, jut not too much."	E_S0
"The first reason that friends can influence students more instead of teacher is that students will have more time to communicate with friends, and it could be 24 hours a day for some closer friends."	S_M1
"Because the time is longer, friends will know about each other."	B_S0
"In my class, there is a girl who is very shy and thre is another one who is outgoing."	I_S0
"After they became friends, they do everything together including having lunch and after school time."	I_S0
"After months, the shy girl became more outgoing and not afraid to talk to people and present in public."	I_S0
"I think that is because of her outgoing friend."	E_S0
"Lastly, people in the same age will be more understanding for each other."	B_C0
"Everyone should know that who people mostly like to talk with when they have something special to say."	I_C0
"That probably will not be teacher and parent because people afraid that last generations would misunderstand them."	I_C0

"In today's society,a lot of people prefer to start their own business,rather than to work for a company."	B_T1
"I think,the reasons for this phenomenon are as fallows,first of all,nowadays there is a great pressure of competition for most jobs,and there are many people looking for jobs,but the threshold for starting their own business is constantly lowing."	E_T1
"people can use their talents to set up personal studios,and even some work can be done at home,such as opening a personal online shop."	B_S0
"second,people are more open-mind than before,and starting their own business is not as good as working for an organisation or company."	I_S0
"more over,working independently can be very flexible according to your own idea and time"	E_S0
 
"Nowadays, the waste of hoesehold garbage is one of the important reasons for the shortage of resources."	B_I0
"Most households choose to shop in a state of imbalance between supply and demand, and most people overbuy to the point where things expire and are discarded."	E_I0
"Similarly, waste treatment plants do little sorting, so many unused resources are wasted."	S_T1
"In Shanghai, the government has introduced measures for garbage classification management, which are effective in a short time, but the garbage classification management system cannot improve everyone's consciousness."	S_M2
"Therefore, the government can only strengthen street management and individual punishment to reduce waste."	B_S0
"The most important thing is to improve people's own quality and moral cultivation."	I_S0
"More training and education of this kind should be carried out."	E_S0
 
"In today's competitve sociaty, we cannot deny that people is long for success."	B_T1
"Thus, for sellers, they will use variety methods to beautify their products in order to sell more objects and then making more money."	E_T1
"Therefore,   in my opinion, I totally agree with that the products not seem much better than they really are."	S_T0
"To begin with, making the products in advertisement look much better will attract more people to buy them."	S_M1
"Needless to say, most consumers will consider the cost performance before they buy a product."	B_S0
"If this prodcut cannot reach the consumers' standard, they will lose interest and even tell their friends do not buy the product."	I_S0
"Thus, one of the tasks of the advertisement is to beautify the products and attract consumers."	I_S0
"Take my mom for example, once she was washing a cloth, and she watched an advertisement about detergent intentionally."	I_S0
"The advertisement said the detergent wloud remove the dirty, such as the oil, ketchup,  in second, and the advertisement also made an experiment to show the process about how to use the detergent."	I_S0
"After watching the  advertisement, my mother thought that the detergent was magic and she ordered three detergents immediataly."	I_S0
"In fact, although the detergent was useless after my mother bought it to home, my mother did not have chance to send it back."	I_S0
"Thus, in order to attract people to consumer for the products, the advertisement will make the products seem much better."	E_S0
"Moreover, because of the competition, the advertisement has to expand the advantage of the products."	S_M1
"In fact, in one area, there are many products compete together."	B_S0
"For shampoo area, there are at leat Panteen, Rojie and  head-shoulders companies compete with others; for computers area, there are at least  lenove, Samsung, Snoy companies compete together."	I_S0

"Under such circumstances, thousands of people have been freed from hunger."	E_I0
"However, for some reasons, famine is still a serious problem in some remote areas."	S_T1
"Due to human irrational activities, in the past ten years and the reason why some don't care for the environment, leading to global warming, drought, floods, tornadoes, frequent extreme weather, such as greatly undermined the agriculture made in many parts of the food can't normal development and, more importantly, rice and soybeans such affordable food circulation is very difficult, the rapid rise, such as Africa and Latin America, they are very poor, so they simply can't afford to buy that led to unnecessary famine, bad business, and even death."	B_M1
"Some news shows that in countries like Africa, high freight rates are also troubling governments."	E_M1
"Due to the widespread drought caused by insufficient irrigation water in some African tribes, food has to be imported from other countries."	B_S0
"However, a limited budget cannot 
balance with a large population."	I_S0
"Is this why, even in this age of advanced technology, there are still large Numbers of hungry people in the world."	I_S0
"Food is essential for human beings, so an adequate food supply is the most important issue for people to have a more stable life, especially those living in poor developing regions and countries."	I_S0
"To solve these problems, governments and international organizations should make joint efforts."	I_S0
"Instead, countries facing severe hunger need to bring in more agricultural experts and advanced technologies to make rational use of their limited land resources."	E_S0
 
"Currently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate  among students: the ability between make new friends and maintain friendship with a group of people, which one is better to people to choose."	S_T1
"Opinion vary from person to person."	B_T0
"Some claim that people should focus on to make new friends."	E_T0
"However, contrary to their view comes my perspective that maintain friendship with a small group of people is more improtant and decides people happiness."	S_T1
"My point can be elaborated as follows."	S_T0
"First of all, maintaining friendship with a group of people can increase the goodwill of our friends, so that when we need help, they will be the first time to help you."	S_M1
"To be more specific, as people grow up, we all will have smoe difficult problem that we cannot slove it by alone, so if we have s group of best friends, they will help as."	B_S0
"On the concrary, if we focus on to make new friends, maybe we will ignore to get into their relationship, just a matter of knowing each other, like exchanging phone number and so on."	I_S0
"So when we get some trouble, they will not come to help as."	I_S0
"For examle, i got to know a loot of people and exchanged phone numbers at the freshman seminar."	I_S0
"So i think i get a lot of friends in this university, may be some time when i need help they can help me."	I_S0
"Once, i was on my way to class in the morning and my car broke down, so i might be lat, and i wanted to ask these people if anyone would help me fix the car or take me to school, but no one will help, so i was late in that class."	E_S0
"Secondly, maintaining friendship with a group of people can improve our knowledge."	S_M1
"To be more specific, when we have a group of people to play, we can do every thing with them, so we will learn some knowledge form them, because not everyone is ferect."	B_S1
"On the contrary, if we have some acdamic queastion want to ask our calssmate, maybe they will not teach you the true anwser, because them are have compete e"	E_S1

"there are a lot of houses in there next to the school and the park."	E_S1
"The second map shows the development of the town."	S_M1
"There are many significant changes."	B_S0
"The size of the center is designed to be a larger area and the countryside will be replaced."	I_S0
"The main road will be replace by dual carriageway."	I_S0
"In addition, pedestrians only will be built in the central area, surrounded by the bus station , shopping center and a car park."	I_S0
"Another significant change about the school, whose size is going to upsize,and the park will be smaller and school will be bigger."	E_S0

"e largest land animal in the modern world."	B_I0
"Social animals that live in herds, elephants are native to both Africa and Asia."	I_I0
"Their large ears, long trunk, and long life span have made elephants one of the most captivating creatures on Earth."	I_I0
"Our long-standing interest in elephants has led to several beliefs about surprising elephant behaviors."	E_I0
"Elephants Are Aware of Approaching Death"	B_M0
"One of the popular beliefs is that when elephants become old and weak, they know that they are nearing the end of their lives."	E_M0
"They demonstrate this by breaking away from their herds and going off alone to certain locations often found near bodies of water -  so called "elephant graveyards" - to die alone."	B_S1
"The idea that old elephants seem aware that they will die soon is supported by the discovery of many sites containing bones exclusively of elderly elephants."	E_S1
"Representing Objects through Art"	B_M0
"Additionally, elephants seem to have artistic ability."	E_M0
"Elephants can be taught to hold a paintbrush in their trunk and use it to paint on a canvas."	B_S0
"Some elephants have been known to paint drawings that represent recognizable things: flowers, other elephants, even themselves."	I_S0
"This talent makes elephants the only animal other than humans to produce art representing the world around them."	E_S0
"Fear of Mice"	S_S2
"Finally, it has long been believed that elephants have a fear of mice."	S_M0
"In 77 C.E., the Roman philosopher and scientist Pliny the Elder wrote that elephants are more afraid of mice, small mammals that can do elephants no harm, than of the much more dangerous animals with which elephants normally share an environment, such as lions or tigers."	B_S1
"In a recent scientific experiment in which a herd of elephants was confronted with several mice, the elephants backed away from the mice and left the area to avoid them."	E_S1

"Nowadys,the percentage of students's dropout rate is increasingly rising."	S_T1
"They may think leaving school has became a popular actions in their peers."	B_S0
"In fact，a teenager is easier to be affected by the situation around them than that of a mature adult ,therefor when one student  has decided to quite school we should isolate him or she."	I_S0
"What's more,I consider that the goverment should pay more attention to foucs on the education of students that already dropped out of school."	I_S0
"Another main reason of students dropout is the  poverty of their family or country."	I_S0
"The truth is that in many poor area of the world, how can the kids go to school when they even could not afford to have a simple meal?"	I_S0
"It is a crural fact that we have to admit."	I_S0
"Actrually, it is also the problem that we should figure out."	I_S0
"All in all,"	E_S0
 
"It is true that we do not recycle enough of our household waste."	S_T1
"Although there are rules and legislation make people recycle their waste to help this situation, I do not believe that a recycling law is necessary."	S_T0
"It is a fact that some people strongly believe government should be involved to make recycling law to tackle the waste problem."	S_M1
"Governments could make it a legal obligation for householders to separate all waste into different bins."	B_S0
"There could be punishments for people who fail to adhere to this law, ranging from a small fine to community service, or even perhaps prison sentences for repeat offenders."	I_S0
"These measures would act as a deterrent and encourage people to obey the recycling law."	I_S0
"As a result, the improved behaviour of homeowners could lead to a clean, waste-free environment for everyone."	E_S0
"However, It would be hard to believe that people would participate in it spontaneously either from their negligence or lack of time to do so."	B_S2
"On the other hand, it is probably a little bit harsh to force people to recycle their waste and abide by the rules only from the concern of punishment or fine, not by their own will."	E_S2
"I believe that governments could put education first rather than punishment or introducing a recycling law."	S_M1
"For example, children could be taught about recycling in schools, and homeowners could be informed about the environmental impact of household waste."	B_S2
"Another tactic that governments should be focused on is to make stricter regulations for the companies that produce a lot of waste such as factories and farms."	I_S2
"Finally, money could also be spent to improve recycling facilities and systems, so that waste is processed more effectively which would help to speed up the process."	E_S2
"In conclusion, perhaps we do have to make recycling a legal requirement, but this would certainly not be the only way to encourage people to dispose of their waste more responsibly."	S_C2
 
"In my opinion,at first,I think both of views are reasonable."	S_T1
"In the first view,people will have more choices by having more TV channels."	B_S0
"There were only 40 to 50 channels in my TV."	I_S0
"I can only choose 1 or 2 channels in the same times."	I_S0
"It was so boring if we always see the same channel repeatly."	I_S0
"And we could just watch TV in the settled time."	I_S0
"But I can chose hundreds of channels now and I can watch TV whenever I want."	I_S0
"When I am at home,I would never feel bored."	I_S0
"It is the benefit that we have much more TV channels."	I_S0
"In the later view,people think that too many TV channels would lead to poor quality."	I_S0
"It is also a truth now."	I_S0
"I thought the progams were always funny."	I_S0
"Although I could just watch TV one or two hours a day,all the TV programs were fantastic."	I_S0
"The shopping TV channels could never been seen."	I_S0
"When you open the TV now,you would find dozens of shopping channels."	I_S0
"It's so bored and I hate that so much."	I_S0
"It will take us more time to find the programs which we want to watch."	I_S0
"I believed that we just need one hundred TV channels."	I_S0
"It is enough for us to chose the programs."	I_S0
"But the shopping programs and publicities should be limited."	I_S0
"The quality of TV programs should be soared."	I_S0
"That is what we want."	E_S0
 
"The author in the reading explores that having living organism on the Mars."	B_I0
"In the lecture, however, the speaker contradicts the argument by claiming that he disagree with this statement from the NASA."	E_I0
"Firstly, according to the reading passage, scientists find there are organic baterial in the meteorite."	S_M0
"In contrast, the professor suggests otherwise."	B_S0
"It says that these bactreia and organic material may come from the microspe."	I_S0
"It can not prove that these stuffs is truely from the meteorite."	E_S0
"Besides, in the reading, it is pointed out that they find the carbonate in the rock."	S_M0
"It is only occured in the circumstance where having the living organism."	B_S0
"On the contrary, the professor argues that these bacteria may come from earth itself."	I_S0
"That is to say the original of the organic material and other stuffs may not derive from the Mars."	E_S0
"Last but not the least, the reading passage believes that having the magnetite on it."	S_M0

"Various TV Channels"	S_S2
"As science and technology is developing rapidly, there are varied approaches for human beings to relax themselves, for instance, outdoor sports, e-books, TV series and computer games."	S_I0
"Television programes are a traditional way for entertainment and it is now at risk of being replaced by other entertainment programs."	B_T1
"I agree with the idea that increasing TV channels could be an efficient way to attract more audiences instead of replacing by others."	I_T1
"Firstly, people in different professions have different needs for TV programs."	E_T1
"People who work in governments may pay more attention to politics and national development; as a result, news and current events world-wide are perfect for them."	S_S0
"Moreover, businessman may more concerned about the economy and stock market and teachers prefer to gain the latest news about education."	S_T1
"Secondly, age could determine the choice of TV programs."	B_S0
"Obviously, almost all children are keen on cartoons."	I_S0
"Teenagers and students love to watch science fiction movies as well as live computer games."	I_S0
"Additionally, many middle-aged citizens prefer international news and business events."	I_S0
"The elderly are more concerned with health."	I_S0
"Thirdly, gender also affects the preference of TV channals."	I_S0
"Compared to the male, the female are more likely to watch TV series, dramas and operas rather than sports and news, which is caused by the difference in personality of gender."	I_S0
"Women are prefer emotional stories and men love understandable news"	E_S0
"In conclusion, it is necessary to expand the amount of TV channels so that it could meet all demands of audiences for viewing."	S_S2
 
"Making decisions can be a crucial part in our daily life."	B_T0
"Some of the them may have a great influence on our future."	I_T0
"Whether young people in the present time and age have no influence on the important far-reaching decisions on our society can be still a controversial topic."	I_T0
"Some people believe that the young cannot have something to do with making that kind of decisions due to the lack of experience and knowledge, while, as for me, I hold the idea that our young people have the ability to influence that decisions."	E_T0
"First of all,  with the development of our society, people nowadays have many metheods to explain your ideas to others."	S_M1
"So, in this way, many approchs are provided for young people to affect others."	B_S0
"For example, as far as I remember, my  cousin who is concerned about the city's futrue plan of protecting the environment always wrote articles to express his own idea on many websites and his blog."	I_S0
"It was because his words were so creditable and his plans were so sophsicated that finally he had many fans online."	I_S0
"And then, he and his fans wrote a letter about their advice of that plans, which were accepted by the government of our city."	I_S0
"As a result, my cousin showed his influence on decision-making."	E_S0
"Second, as my point of view, our government is more likely to listen to the young."	S_M1
"That means our young people can take part in the process of making decision."	B_S0
"Let me take my experience as an example."	I_S0
"When I was in high school, I was selected as a representative to attend a important meeting about the future buget in our city."	I_S0
"In that meeting, I found that half of people who attended to that meeting were students rangeing from high school to college."	I_S0

"What is illustrated in the charts are the information which is about the ages of the poplations of Yemen and Italy in 2000 and predictions for 2050."	S_I0
"It is obviously that the age of Yemen from 0 to 14 take a half part and the one from 15 to 59 take nearly a half population."	B_T1
"The population which is up to 60 years old is occupy a minimal part of the whole chart."	I_T1
"However in 2050, the age of people from 15 to 59 take the largest part of the whole population (57.3%)."	E_T1
"The people whose age is 0 to 14 have slightly decrease"	S_S2
 
"Nowadays,the number of student has a great increase."	S_T1
"at same time,the quality of student's mental health has a little decrease."	B_S0
"I think young student' mental problem is not unform."	I_S0
"I just think this condition has it's reason."	I_S0
"first,young students always has pressure on studying."	I_S0
"example,if one student spend long time on a hard course."	I_S0
"it often make him annoy."	I_S0
"and teacher often have homework for student,if a student have touble with this course and with nobody help him,it is easily to  led this student hate studying."	I_S0
"second,the teacher in Chinese school always push foward student on their studying."	I_S0
"student have no time studying by themself."	I_S0
"it often make people disappointed."	I_S0
"for example,if a student want to review a course which he is interested,but another  course teacher to give an assignment,this student's original plan has been changed actively,so this young student will have negative thought on studying."	I_S0
"The last but not least,the young student is only children,every children is prefer playing rather than studying."	I_S0
"the reason for this point is young student's view of world is not fully."	I_S0
"they are also be in a educated stage."	I_S0
"so school is not a fascinate place for young students."	I_S0
"Anyway,the young students is only children now ,the  school and teacher should not give too much pressure on them."	I_S0
"the can give student more free time to do something they like,and I think school should take mental course on young student so that they can have a right view of world."	E_S0
 
"In modern society,there are several languages disappear every year."	B_I0
"Someone reckon that it is not necessary for us because it will make the life and communication easier."	I_I0
"I disagrue this opinion."	I_I0
"First of all, all languages symbolize the essence of a civilization or culture, and the disappearance of language means the loss of culture."	E_I0
"Then, the achievements made by this culture will be forgotten by people, and later generations will spend more time and energy on research."	S_T1
"Second, most of the lost languages are minority languages and dialects."	S_M1
"Dialects are also unique to a region."	B_S0
"On the one hand, the existence of dialect enriches the vitality of the language and makes it spread."	I_S0
"On the other hand, the existence of dialect also creates the diversity of literature and art."	E_S0
"The other side of the argument is also valid."	S_M1
"The current international trend is more and more focused on trade or other forms of globalization."	B_S0
"As a result, differences in language can lead to barriers and conflicts in trade."	I_S0
"But this can be overcome by translating and teaching the language."	E_S0
"In conclusion,in my opinion,spending money or time to protect an endangered language is necessary."	B_C1
"This task is not only for the government, but for all of us."	E_C1
 
"With the development of society, people are demanding more and more."	S_I0
"Parents hop to cultivate their children into successful people, but many children are unwilling to study seriously."	B_T1
"So parents thinks a loy of ways to reward their children and peomote them to study seriously."	I_T1
"Most parents choose to pay money when their children get a high score."	E_T1
"I do not think it is the best way to promote chilfren's learning, but it is also very effective."	S_T0
"First of all, this method can promote children's active learning."	S_M2
"Most children are very playful, and they cry and scream when their parents do not buy them what they want."	B_S0
"On the other hand, at that time, parents tell their children that they can earn pocket money by studing hard, and most of the chidren will try to get high marks to get rewards."	I_S0
"And in the process of learning, children can develop good  habits like high concentration in doing things."	E_S0
"Second, some people may think that this method may lead to a idea of measuring everything with money when the children grow up, but I thinks the probability of this problem is very small."	B_C0
"In elementary school and junior high school, parents can use pocket money as a reward accoding to children's scores in school."	I_C0
"When the children go to high school, they will realize the important of learning."	E_C0
"For example, my brother was very playful, when he was a child."	B_S0
"His parents use pocket money as a reward for him to buy his favorite candy, but when my brother was in high school, all the students in the class were preparing for college entrance examination."	I_S0
"Naturally, he did not need to rely on these money to urge hime to study."	E_S0
 
"Nowadays many students who are tired of learing basic course are leaving schools with negative thoughts on studying."	S_T0
"Personly,maybe it's bad for their development and the quality of life."	B_S0
"What takes me into deep consideration is the reason of the phenoenon."	I_S0
"Fisrtly,with the socity developing quickly,a number of knowledge is not useful now anymore."	I_S0
"The fact give them a wrong informatian that studying is not useful."	I_S0
"They are afraid of being a bookworm,so they grasp every oppotunity to play rather than studying."	I_S0
"Secondly,we pay more attention on enconomic development than science."	I_S0
"A large amount of people have an urge to make money instead of doing research."	I_S0
"From their opinon,what they learn in school is a waste of time."	I_S0
"They igore the importance of basic course."	I_S0
"Last but not least,they can't feel the joy from studying,so they escape or give up early."	I_S0
"It occuries to me that my own experience of my study."	I_S0
"Once I felt the knowledge I leart is useless for my dream."	I_S0
"So I didn't concentrate on studying."	I_S0
"I became lazy and hang out with friends every nights."	I_S0
"When I got my final grades and found my parents working for making a life hard,I realized how big a mistake I made."	I_S0

"This figure is significantly higher than the propotion of those who bought the house."	B_S2
"The gap between these two propotions narrowed as people became richer, and the figures for 1971 were the same."	E_S2
"while life quality in England increased even faster over the 40 years after 1971, the decline of renting house remain steady."	S_M0
"And there was a light fluctuation between 1991 and 2011."	S_S2
"Overall, households in England have made an effort to make an living and keep improving their living conditions."	S_M0
"For almost a century, the situation of owning and renting accomodation has totally reversed."	S_S2
 
"With the improvement of people’s living standards, shopping and consuming become increasingly popular."	S_I0
"Meanwhile, it is noteworthy that some individuals purchase goods they don not need and cannot afford, which gives rise to be in debt."	S_T1

"Variety of luxuries such as Dior and Channel, never fail to fascinate consumers, because of their high quality."	B_S0
"For this feature, your satisfaction of goods is guaranteed."	I_S0

"Furthermore, as the booming of show business, the number of blindly star chasers has been increasing."	S_M0
"In order to follow star style, they are crazy to buy luxuries over budget."	S_S2
"It is no doubt that this phenomenon has a negative impact on our society, thus, it is high time that all sectors of society took action."	S_M0
"For the government, why not reduce tax rate to cut luxuries’ price?"	B_S0
"A proper price level will let more people enjoy better."	I_S0
"Strengthening the oversight and supervision of product quality is the other measure."	I_S0
"Only when all the productions are superior in quality, people may not buy luxuries for pursuing quality."	E_S0
"For us students, a rational consumption concept is of value."	S_M0

"As they lern and constantly learning,they will be more and more learning,in order to win the exam."	I_S0

"This essay will discuss the benefits and drawbacks of three different media, namely books, radio and television."	O

"The main advantage of books is that they are usually considered to be reliable sources of information."	I_S0
"People tend to refer to books when they want to research a subject in depth, and for this reason they continue to play an important role in education."	I_S0
"On the other hand, books quickly go out of date, and therefore they are not the best medium for communicating news stories."	I_S0
"Radio is a much more effective medium than books for the communication of up-to-date information."	I_S0
"We can listen to news broadcasts about events as they happen, and a key benefit of radio is that we can listen to it while doing other activities, such as driving or working."	I_S0

"I agree with this statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today."	B_I0
"My first reason is that Cars will give off a lot of exhaust gas and pollute the environment."	I_I0
"Nowadays, more and more people have cars ,they use the cars every where they go and made a grate of pollute."	I_I0
"Take China an example."	I_I0
"A few years age，Car emissions and other factors have led to a drop in air quality in China's major cities, and even the production of PM2.5, which impedes traffic."	I_I0
"People began to have to wear masks on the streets."	E_I0
"My second reason is the development of science and technology."	S_M1
"With the launch of new energy vehicles, more and more people begin to use new energy vehicles."	B_S1
"They don't leave behind the exhaust, and even better, new-energy cars can greatly reduce the noise pollution to the city."	E_S1

"So this idea is a corollary."	E_C0
 
"Nowadays many people prefer to be self-employed, instead of working for a company or organisation."	S_T1
"In my opinion, the drawbacks whcih are brought about by this issue are more than its benefits."	S_T0
"The education today is much better than that in the past and there are more resourses achievable by individuals."	S_M0
"people are more creative, more disciplined than before."	B_S0
"they are not purchasing a job nowadays  but would like to do something they're interested in."	I_S0
"Therefore, more and more young people would like to be self-employed, doing the job they'd like or the job they can realise their value rather than to work for a company, getting salary every month."	I_S0
"Moreover, there're more opportunities in the global business market."	I_S0
"Many people choose to  be self-employed in order to seize these opportunities."	I_S0
"some of them want to become entrepreneurs, setting up new businesses and earning lots of money."	E_S0
"however, there are still several disadvantages."	S_M0
"people who choose to be self-employed must be responsible for themselves."	B_S1
"Although there are more opportunites in the global business market, at the same time there are more risks, and the market is likely to be more and more competitive."	E_S1
"Besides, people who choose to be self-employed cannot have the chance to learn teamworks within a company, for example, how to get along with your boss and colleagues."	S_M0

"Some people believe that the music is useful to gather people of both various cultures and ages together."	I_I0

"It is surely certain that music is able to take people from different countries together."	S_M1
"More specifically, thanks to the advent of smart phones, we get to plenty of musics  just with the click of mouse."	B_S0
"As we all know, musics we can search for include pop, jazz, folk and so forth, you name it, so we are able to listen to music whenever and wherever, even from foreign singers."	I_S0
"Take Justin bieber for example, he has become an icon for many people around the world, we can feel the freedom and passion of western countries through his musics."	E_S0
"However, admitting the former is not the same as assuming that music could bring people of all ages together."	S_M1
"First of all, people of different ages normally have different tastes in music."	B_S0
"Generally, grandmothers are often considered to be the group enjoying the red songs, that is, revolutionary songs, whic is mainly because they live in an unpeaceful and revolutionary age."	I_S0
"However, moms love songs that were popular in the 1980s when they were children, such as "sweet honey" , "the jasmine" and some stuff like that, which bring them back to beautiful memories of youth."	I_S0
"By contrast, we teenagers love pop songs, especially hey pop, which allow us feel passionate and characteristic."	E_S0
"In conclusion,while I agree that people of different cultures get to gather because of music, I still could not believe that people at different life stages are able to stay togather due to music."	S_C2

"From my pespective,the one owe the ability of managing should be given more salaries."	E_T1
"The stuff in management sector should attain a higher salaries due to the managing and co-operating is the core of a  sector even the whole company ."	B_S0
"In the first place, all the staff in a sector,indeed,need the order and catogories of peforming tasks to carry out the item orderly and succcessfully."	I_S0
"Secondly,the information feedbacks and advices are gathered by managers and then they refine the ways and means of collations,while the other worker only perform specialised expertise."	I_S0
"Without a precise arragement,a good brain pool can't perform their most potencial  intelligence."	I_S0
"There are some dowmsides of reward staff in different ranking of salaries."	I_S0
"It is unfair for other ordinary workers because they contribute the equavalent energe and sweat for the commpany."	I_S0
"when ordinary staff feel that they are treated different,the low productivity and hostility emotion as well as job hopping may propably happen."	I_S0
"For instance,an appearent gap in two types' stuff cause chaos in a sector."	I_S0
"However,a propriate diffirence in salaries should be the entitlement of management stuff ,they deserve it because they owe more personal skills range  from communication skills to coordinate ability,which need rich experiece."	I_S0

"In the reading material, the author proposes three theories to explain why the population reduced dramatically after about year 1500."	S_I0
"The professor, however, contradicts the view for the following reasons."	S_T0
"Firstly, the reading material alludes to the facts that Angor Wat  is  to be attacked because of its location and its prosperous economy,  yet the professor asserts that the invaders will not start a war considering the economic reason."	S_M2
"This is because stay at their own city and work can enable them to become rich."	B_S2
"Secondly,"	E_S2
 
"Education, at present era, has inevitably been a vital part of the daily life of schools."	B_I0
"It is argued that pupils should not be classified by academic performance."	I_I0
"Personally, I disagree with the assertion."	E_I0
"Superficially, it seems true that the schools which do not according to the results of enrollment are conducive to the protection of students' mental health."	S_M1
"The reason is that learners are not graded, so that the classes contain students of all levels, they do not consider that they are treated differently, therefore, their psychology is protected."	B_S1
"However, this notion is biased in some measure, ignoring the fact that the problem of psychology involves many aspects, although the learners with low grades are in classes that include students with different grades, these relatively less excellent students may feel the difference in academic performance, which will lead to negative sentiments, and such emotions are harmful to psychology."	E_S1
"Schools which recruit students according to their grades can enhance overall performance."	S_M1
"On the grounds that the pupils are selected through their academic abilities, students of similar level have class together, so that they can keep up with the pace of the class, and the curricula which are arranged by instructors for majority of students are more effective, which is conducive to the improvement of students' score."	B_S0
"Another advantage of the classification lighten the teacher's teaching burden."	I_S0
"On account of the youngsters who are assigned to a class according to their grades, they have similar learning abilities will be grouped together, leading to class materials which are prepared by the teacher suiting majority of students."	I_S0
"And consequently, the pressure of teacher is declined."	E_S0
"In conclusion, I suppose that division has more advantages for pupils because not only will it strengthen the class performance, but it will let the students' psychology getting better care."	S_C2
 
"The professors can get much wider auciences by appearing  on television."	B_T1
"Thus, more scholars and students  can get the knowledges and their views."	I_T1

"If they can take the time to do research  with students , it will be more worthy for the national education."	E_T1
"The universities can also get  benefits  from these programs."	S_M2
"In fact, it make more people  think  the professors' university  is nice and  there are many knowledgeable  faculty members."	B_S0
"It gives the public a golden opportunity to contact with university  professors."	I_S0
"Indeed, they can learn the professional views which is modified to be easilier understand."	I_S0
"Nevertheless , it is easy to imagine that the goal of television programs' owners is gain more audiences and money."	I_S0
"Therefore, the best choice they do is choosing the most fashional title."	I_S0

"I agree that people in senior management positions to have much higher salaries than other workers in the same company or organisation."	S_T1

"Nowdays,degree and exercises is becoming more and more important when we are finding a job."	I_S0
"Most of  personal deparments take these into consderion."	I_S0
"For example, the senior management positions need  the graduate degree or MBA,but I just have undergraduate degree."	I_S0
"That means I can not get the position."	I_S0
"The position rely on degree which effects salaries signifiantly."	I_S0
"In addition,Your age is also a strong factor supporing my opiniom."	I_S0
"It stands for experience."	I_S0
"If you have richer experience in you woke,you wii be more  worth getting the position."	I_S0
"Overall, I believe the more effort you made, the senior position and more salaries you gotten."	I_S0
"We should take action to improve ourselves increasely in order to differ from other people in the terms of senior  management positions"	E_S0

"The pie charts illustrate the percentage of British students at one university in England who were able to speak foriegn languages without English from 2000 to 2010."	S_T1
"Students can spoke English account for the largest proportion in 2000,at 30%,after which it increase to 35% in 2010."	B_S0
"Meanwhile,the  
figure for students who can use another or two other languages to cummunicate with others had same trend,the growth was slight between 2000 and 2010,during which time the proportion of students were able to use another language witnessed a significant increase from 15 to 20."	I_S0
"In addition ,10 of students followed by a sharp rise to 15 in 2010."	I_S0
"It was also noticeable that the figure for undergraduates who can used German remain stable at 10 over ten."	I_S0
"In contrast, the period between 2000 and 2010 experienced an dramatic drop from 20 to 10 in the percentage of student who were speak Spanish."	I_S0
"And the students can use French to talk with othersndecrease from 15 to 10 over the 10 years from 2000 to 2010."	I_S0

"The map illustrate the development of the center of a small town called Islip."	S_I0
"According to the first map,this center is close to a countryside."	S_M1
"Shops and main road  are locate in north of housing."	B_S0
"In the middle and south of the entire map is a large block of housing."	I_S0
"A park is situated in the east of whole map next to the road."	I_S0
"In th e south ,there is a school."	E_S0
"Looking at the second map in more detail,we can see that countryside is planned to replace by dual carriageway."	S_M1
"main road is projected to reconstruct to pedestrians only."	B_S0
"Bus station,shopping center,car park and new housing are schedule to build in the north of pedestrians."	I_S0
"New housing is adjacent to the park and the whole middle area is surrounded by dual carriageway."	I_S0
"The school is planned to build along the dual carriageway."	E_S0

"Nowadays works on school has been a topic for many students and it causes a topic that whether the students learn much more effectively than when they are asked to work alone on projects when teachers assign projects on which students must work together."	B_I0
"This divides students into two different camps with opposite opinions, and some students would like to hold the opinion that the students will learn much more effectively when work alone."	E_I0
"However, I prefer working together with others, and there are reasons and examples that can illustrate my opinions."	S_T1
"First and foremost, working with others makes it possible for the students to have more ideas."	S_M1
"To be more specific, when a group of students are discussing a problem, they will come up with different opinions, and then they can think of every ideas and combine them together in order to get a better answer and save time."	B_S0
"In opposition, if students just work alone, they can not come up with so many ideas at the same time and they will spend quite a lot of time in order to get an answer which can be slow and not so efficient."	I_S0
"For example, one of my best friends, who always like to attend group study, said that every time when he is in a group, they can think out so many ideas and they will compare these ideas and select the best one, then in this way they can not only save time, but also get the best answer."	E_S0
"In the second place, with group studying, students get more access to a better method which can help them be more efficiently."	S_M1
"This is because when students study together, if they meet a problem, different people will came up with different solutions, and they can all learn from each other, in this way, they can even learn so many ways just from one question which can help them improve their ability in studying that can help them to be more efficiently."	B_S0
"In opposition, when students work alone, they meet the same trouble, they can not turn to others for help, instead they will spend quite a lot of time for this problem and they may even get the wrong answer that may waste them a lot of time."	I_S0
"Let's take myself as an example, once when I was in a  group, we discuss a math probelm and different people have different methods to solve this, then we begin to discuss every methods and every one can learn so many methods  that can help them improve their ability in math."	E_S0
"Granted, it may be reasonable and attractive that some poeple claim that when teachers assign projects on which students must work together, students will learn more efficiently if they work alone, since when students work alone, they don't have to use the time to dicuss with others which can help them save time and use it to learn more."	B_C0
"However, it can not hold water, since if students don't discuss, they will make mistakes quite often, as a result they will spend even more time to check and revise the mistake which can even waste them more time."	I_C0
"So I am still convinced by my standpoint that students will learn more effectively when work together."	E_C0
 
"In the lecture, the speaker casts dount on the reading passage's viewpoint that Native Amercians came from Europe instead of Asia."	B_I0
"However, she argues that the Amercians still came from Asia."	I_I0
"And she uses three specific points to confirm her idea."	E_I0
"First, even though the ariticle suggests that Clovis people in America used the similar spears that Solutreans in Europe uesd, the professor thinks in the lecture that it is impossible since Solutreans had died out before Clovis people's attendence."	S_M0
"There is no way to connect two kind of people together."	S_S2
"Moreover, despite the statement in the reading that there are some same characteristic in the physical between early Amercians and the Solutreans espically the skulls, the speaker contends that the evidence in reading are not strong enough to connect two tribes."	S_M0
"She supports this point with the fact that the common on skulls can be found in all human species all over the world."	S_S2
"Lastly, the author of the reading claims that the Solutreans were able to arrive the Ameicas by ship across the Atlantic Ocean whereas the lecture asserts it is impossible due to two reasons."	S_M0

"In recent year, whether parents should offer their children money for each high grade becomes a relatively controversial problem."	B_I0
"Some individuals believe that parents are supposed not to reward each time."	E_I0
"As far as I'm concerned, I disagree."	B_T0
"I think it is positive for students to be provided money for high marks."	E_T0
"On the one hand, I think it is a motivation which encourages students to study hard."	S_M2
"It also represents a conception that if you work hard enough, you can get what you want."	B_S0
"My cousin is a good illustration."	I_S0
"There was some time that his parents decided to offer money for him to buy i-phone six if he got a high grade in final exam."	I_S0
"During that period, he did too much exercises and prepared a lot and even spent twice as much time as usual."	I_S0
"Finally, he made it."	I_S0
"This experiece also encourages me to try my best for everthing I would like 
  On the other hand, children could also learn financial management advance by getting extral money."	I_S0
"Children could have a totally different attitude money they achieve, comparing with pin money they get directly from parents."	I_S0
"Financial management includes the addition of inflow, the subtraction of outflow and the distribution of money to related purpose."	I_S0
"For example, I want to but a pet dog which deserves one thousand RMB."	I_S0
"I have to accumulate the variation of budget and the acutual cost."	E_S0
"Admittedly, it is clever to offer no money for students to some degrees, because the money could distort the attitudes of children for studies."	B_C1
"However, if the amount of money was relatively proper, this result could not happen."	E_C1
 
"Recently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate amone people that will people spend less time cooking and preparing foods than they do in the future."	B_I0
"Different opinions vary from person to person."	E_I0
"Some holds the belief that things will remain the same."	S_T0
"However, from my perspective, less time will be taken to cook and prepare food."	S_T1
"First, the future society will require people to be more efficient."	S_M1
"As acknowleged by all that our society is advancing at an incredible speed, and the pressure force people to waste no time to accomplish thier work."	B_S0
"Thus, there will be no enough time for them to cook and prepare food as the old days."	I_S0
"Take my grandmother for example."	I_S0
"When she was a young girl, she and her mother used to spent hours to pick up vegetable and clean animals for the whole family to eat."	I_S0
"However, we young people have got used to take meals as daliy tasks without taking much care of that."	I_S0
"Such as the instant noodles and fast food, it's seems a waste of time on eating so considerately."	E_S0
"On the other side, the market will be more abunant for us to buy foods well cooked instead of preparing them ourselves."	S_M1
"It's hard for our ancestors to predict the morden way to eat as they had to cultivate or caputure their food for a living."	B_S0
"Controversially, we don't need to know exactly how the foods become acessible, since all we need to do is drive by the supermarket, pick up what we want, and microwave them."	I_S0
"So I frimly believe that in 20 years, the way for human to get food will continutely advance."	I_S0
"As for university students of present China, we have already accstomed to have our foods deliveried through the internet."	E_S0
"To put in the nut shell, the way for human to get foods will definitely continute advance,not only because the society require faster lives, but the market will offer more choises for us to take."	S_C2
 
"In this chart we can see it show us some change about international tourism and some product of dairy and meat from 2000 to 2025."	B_I0
"Firstly, we can know that according to the future projections intertional tourism and dairy products increas a large amount in 2025 compare with 25 years ago,they will all have more than 9 biilions pounds that will earn in exports."	E_I0
"Second,if this projections is correct, the export of meat products will discreas,it will take less and less ."	S_M2
"It will just have 5 billions pound in 2025,we should remenber that in 2000 it can products 6 billions to Southland."	B_S2
"From this chart, we can learn this projections'goal,it means agriculture will become less than before, and international ecnomy will rise."	E_S2
 
"I understand that nowadays it is very efficient for parents to offer money to their school-age children for stimulating them on each high grade."	S_T1
"As a matter of fact many people equate money with success from a young age: the more money you earn, the more successful you are."	S_T0
"However, thr financial aspect is not the point of a student's study."	B_T1
"The learning experience with one's classmates, the personal fulfillment from one's hard-working, and the opportunity to balance your study and relaxing time are much more important for a child."	E_T1
"A student who spend 12 hours everyday or more at their study just for money, in my opinion, should change their mind and enjoy their learning environment, especially the company of their classmates."	S_M0
"After all, the prospect of having to spend any amount of time in a classroom with people who does not respect, who are hostile, will have a very negative effect on one's disposition and mental health."	B_S1
"A few more money that parents put in the bank account can't compensate for this."	E_S1
"Similarly, a student should derive a special fulfillment or pleasure from his test."	S_M0
"One should not waste his time by doing something that is boring or of no use for his life even if it is well paid."	B_S0
"this is an important point that should be taught to a person from a young age, but what the parents do just have the opposite effects."	I_S0
"We should keep in mind that the money earned only enrich one's life away from work but not enhance the work experience."	E_S0
"Finally, the study life can only be enjoyed adequately if there is enough interst in your learning experience."	S_M0
"Afluence affords many nice things, such as games, toys or other things you dreamed of, but a person who has to study night and day just for money without any happiness will not be able to derive any pleasure from them."	B_S0
"Also, a father or a mother who provides a lot of money for their children might be able to attract them into getting a higher grade, but how much good does that do if their children never respect his study?"	I_S0
"Thus the money offered to get a high grade might cost a person more than it affords."	E_S0

"Others, howeber, may against woth the above oponion that it will be more combenient to be led by a tour guide."	S_T1
"As I see it, travel within a goup will be better."	S_T0
"First and foremost, it is no doubted that it wouldbe much easier for us to prepare everything before travel if we travel in a group, since alost everything will be considered by tour guide, such as order totel, manage toute and even bisit what kinds of scenery spots."	S_M0
"And this what we need to do is just go with tour guide and admire various stages of nature and different place."	S_S2
"Additionally, it will always take too much time for is to learn about where we pretend to vusut without the help of tour guide, and people are now become more and more busy, and the reason for them to travel is to relax themselves and get rid of the live which all arranged by themselves, moreober, we will have chance to know some people who share rhe same interest with us in the group, and it will be much happy make griend with such people during our tourism."	B_M0
"Last but not least, although, some people may said that it will be alittle hurry to travel led by a tour guide, neverthelessm since out schedual is arranged by the tour guides who are very sophiscated avout certain places and following with them will definitely the best choice since we can go many places within limited time which is impossible for the people who travel to a new place by themselves."	E_M0
"Also, we will know much about certain spot with the introduction of tour guide and it will be much easer for is to rememver the thing about the scenery."	S_S2

"To illustrate, given the above exmaple, it is not uncommon to discover that the university entrance exam is extremely important in China, which serves as an indispensable role in every students' life."	B_S0

"In this regard, many company will express terms that people are supposed to respect others."	I_S0
"In addition, learing to listening your friends or parents's saying is indespensible during your interaction."	E_S0

"More and more people suggest governments to impose higher tax on fast food which leads to health problems."	S_I0
"Although imposing a higher tax on junk food may give people better life quality by investing tax on some infrastructures, I would argue that this may have negative effects on health and economies."	S_T1
"If governments impose a higher tax on fast food, this may cause more health problems."	S_M1
"With the quicker pace of the society, people have to spend more time on work and study, which may lead to a problem that they have a little time to have meals; therefore, a large proportion of them choose to have fast food which may result on obesity because it has shorter preparing time."	B_S0
"However, if the tax on junk food increases, many middle-class people choose not to eat meals, resulting in worse illness."	I_S0
"For example, a worker who do not eat lunch for a long time may suffer from stomachache."	I_S0
"Consequently, putting a higher tax on fast food may cause more harm to people's bodies."	E_S0
"People can get better living standards as a result of higher tax by investing the infrastructures."	S_M1
"As governments get money from the tax, they can invest the money to some fundamental systems like hospitals and schools to ensure the      residents to have better treatment and education."	B_S0
"Although raising the tax enables people to live more comfortable, a very high tax may cause a lot of people rejecting fast food, leading to a problem that a lot of fast food restaurants may go bankrupt."	I_S0
"In this way, higher tax may not has positive influences on economies."	E_S0
"In conclution, I would argue that governments should advocate the harmness of fast food rather than impose a higher tax on it, even though sometimes putting a tax can provide people with better live standards."	S_C2
 
"Working in the same organisation or the same company all the time is awesome choice for some people ,it's important for people to have a stable job."	S_T0

"For example, a person who coaches sports in senior high school, what he needs to do is that teach his students to master the skills of basketball or other sports and make them pass the physical exam."	I_S0
"It's a stable job to make him happiness."	E_S0
"On the other hand,people who works for different organisation will acquire abundant working experience in this ocuppiation and know a lot of friends."	S_M1
"It's better than in same organisation as they can they don't need to think about other problems and master other knowledge of different area."	S_S2

"Many peple adavocate this trend while some others insist that more investment should be given to the improvement of public service system which they think is more essential to citizen's life rather than the literature service."	I_S0
"To my knowledge, I can agree more with the latter opinion."	I_S0
"Adimmttedly, It is more likely to raise the level of people's spritual life ,if  a great deal of money is invested into the literature business."	I_S0
"Sitting comfortablely in the luxary theater to be the audience of the a great concert, standing in front of the well-known  painting created by the famous artists,  studying the facinating sculpture in one exibition hall, all these result in a sense of spritual satisfactory from the citizens."	I_S0
"Howerver, without  good condition of the public facilities, It is no doubt that peolpe can get the true benefit."	I_S0
"In other words, only by investing money into the establishment of the public service ,can the both the society and individual get get the advantages."	I_S0
"It is imaginable that you would be defenitely grateful  seeing your children aquiring  the best exducation and surrounded by the best qualified teachers and elegent learning environment."	I_S0

"Since all the people can be equal to enjoy the convenience that brought by the government, they are aware of the healthy social management machnism arranged by the government."	I_S0
"there is no doubt that high rate of violence and sense of unfainess will be eliminated which is quite good to the development of the whole society."	I_S0
"All in all, I prefer to support the view that investment on the public  service is advantagous to the that on  literature."	E_S0
 
"It is believed that when parents and teachers teach good behavior to children can use some punishments."	S_I0

"For example, if you go other city to find a job, and u must work together with your colleague, you need to discuss everything small things, also make every imporant decisions."	I_S0
"But when you first come to this city, you even don't know each other, so now history is a good topic."	I_S0

"The development of children's ability to distinguish right from wrong is an important thing for them in their growing up."	S_T1
"As children are taught and grow up, most children can form a view of right and wrong."	B_S0
"I don't think punishment matters."	I_S0
"I therefore disagree with this view."	I_S0
"To some extent, it depends on the age of the child."	I_S0
"For example, it is not wise to punish a very young child."	I_S0
"Because the young child did not understand what had happened to him, and did not know why he was punished."	I_S0
"However, when a child grows up, he can praise and encourage his correct behavior, and can criticize and stop his mistakes."	I_S0
"This method is better than severe punishment, because the former is handled in a gentle and effective manner that allows the child to embrace it."	I_S0
"while the latter may have a negative impact on the child."	I_S0
"In order to help children realize the difference between right and wrong, I think teachers and parents should set an example to their children by example first, which is also a very effective method of education."	I_S0
"If punishment is necessary, corporal punishment and abuse can not be carried out."	I_S0
"Because it can cause misunderstanding to the child that adults bully the child is right."	I_S0
"Which leads them to bully others."	I_S0
"In addition, teachers and parents can use a lot of other educational methods to correct their children's wrong behavior, such as confinement, there is an old saying in China called face wall thinking, which can let them calm down to reflect on their mistakes."	I_S0
"Punishment should serve as a useful warning that they will bear the consequences of their mistakes, such as apologizing to those they have hurt and picking up the rubbish they have lost."	I_S0
"This can foster a child's sense of responsibility."	I_S0
"In general, I disagree with the improper punishment of children, and punishment should play a positive warning role."	I_S0
"At the same time, parents and teachers should lead by example to educate their children."	E_S0
 
"As the development of science and technology, place on Earth like South Pole becomes a choice for scientists and tourists to go to."	S_T1

"As for me, disadvantages might be more."	I_S0
"From my point of view, I don't think that it is suitable for too many people to involve in."	I_S0
"First, the increasing number of people coming to South Pole means the more carbon dioxide is produced there."	I_S0
"The increasing amount of the greenhouse gas can increase the speed of ice melting in South Pole, which can be pretty dangerous to the world."	I_S0
"Also, letting tourists go to South Pole is probably not a smart idea."	I_S0
"Tourists are often lack of knowledge of nature and geography."	I_S0
"They might not have the strong sense of protecting environment as the scientists and experts do."	I_S0
"What will bring is the damages to the environment in South Pole, and even the unstaindable litters and packages."	I_S0
"Too much human life trace might also be harmful for the environment and the creatures there."	I_S0
"Besides, the climate and conditions in the South Poles is really not nice for most of us."	I_S0
"It has an inconvenient geographical location as well, which is isolated by the oceans and having the distance of more than thousands kilometers between the South Pole and the nearest continent."	I_S0
"If something happens to the tourist, he/she might be facing a huge trouble of not being able to finding any efficient and professional medical centres."	I_S0
"Certainly we don't want things like this happen."	I_S0
"In addition, there are also a large number of animals in the South Pole."	I_S0
"If too many people invade in their territory, they might be scared and maybe they would have to change the place of living."	I_S0
"It is also essential to protect animals in the South Pole as well as their habitat."	I_S0
"In a conclusion, it is not a good idea for people to travel to the South Pole."	I_S0
"At least the technology nowadays is not be able to make the South Pole a suitable travelling location."	I_S0

"Learning a language is one of the efficient way to communicate with others who are foreigners."	I_S0
"Even they could have a real good relationship."	I_S0
"Beyond that."	I_S0
"more and more people are willing to travel or work abroad."	I_S0
"Learning a second language is convenient for them to understand the meaning others' words."	I_S0
"Although,working and travelling abroad is the main reason why the majority of people learn languages ,there have been other reason for studying."	I_S0
"Interest is the greatest motivator of learn foreign the second language."	I_S0
"Only if people are interested in the language will they keep studying."	I_S0

"It is an efficient way to comprehend history in depth."	I_S0
"Beyond that,people can broaden their horizons in the context of globalization."	I_S0
"And skillfully mastering a foreign language is benificial to learning more about the world."	I_S0
"Overall,although the majority of people learn a second even third language in order to solve the problems which happened when they are travelling or working aroad,I think people have  recognized the necessary of learning a foreign language for other purposes."	E_S0

"In the reading material, the author argues that Edmontosaurus had to migrate to the southern part in order to survive  in  the cold weather in the North Slope."	S_I0
"The lecturer, however, reputes that it is not convincing at all for these reasons."	S_T0
"First of all, the passage points out that Edmontosaurus were fed on plants exclusively and it was difficult for them to find  food in cold winter."	S_M1
"Yet the speaker argues that warm weather in summer provided perfect condition for plants to grow."	B_S0
"So Edmontosaurus might found lots of nutritious dead vegetation around in the winter, which made migration  unnecessary."	I_S0
"Second, unearthed skeletons from the same site indicated that Edmontosaurus lived in herds."	I_S0
"Living in herds made  migration much easy."	I_S0
"But the lecturer gave an example of Roosevelt elks to prove that group living might have various  types of reasons."	I_S0
"So Edmontosaurus may live in herds in order to seek for extra protection."	I_S0
"So living in herds could not provide evidence for migration claim."	E_S0
"Lastly, Edmontosaurus, in view of the writer, had the ability of longdistance movement."	S_M1
"Although the lecturer admitted  the locomotive capability of Edmontosaurus, he points out that juvenile Edmontosaurus were lack of such ability."	S_S2
"So the  herd would not leave juveniles behind in the North Slope, which strongly reputes the author's claim"	O

"In this essay, I will give my personal explanation for this phenomenon as well as identify some of the drawbacks that self-employed people might face."	O
"To begin with, it has been pointed out that the surge in the number of self-employed people is the legacy of the great economic recession started in 2008."	S_M0
"Due to the extreme hardships in the global economies in that time, many large companies either went bankrupt or had to drastically cut down on their workforces, leaving colossal numbers of employees redundant."	B_S1
"As a result, in concerted attempt s to lift themselves out of this desperate situation, many people decided on starting their own business."	E_S1
"In addition to that, this tendency is prolonged and become influential even after the economy has recovered because of the privileges it brings to self-employed people."	S_M0
"These benefits are claimed to include higher monetary earning as well as the freedom to execute new ideas."	S_S2
"Given that startup companies are proven to be efficient in times of economic crisis, they also have the potential to generate certain problems to business owners."	S_M0
"Firstly, because the self-employed have to establish their companies from scratch, their chances of success is believed to be lower in comparison with their counterparts who choose to work for already prestigious corporations."	B_S1
"Secondly, while the small scale might be one of those businesses' merits in difficult times of the economy, it also the factor that in many cases, renders those companies totally overwhelmed and outcompeted by large ones."	E_S1
"In conclusion, while the emergence of self-employment has manifested itself as an inexorable process of the world economy after the great recession in 2008, the odds of people who wish to pursue this form of employment to be successful still remain relatively low."	S_C2
 
"As we all know, it is important to find the direction of  the future."	B_I0
"The dreams, the goals can tell people what the direction is and people will have a bright future when they achieve the dreams or the goals."	I_I0
"But the question is, what is the better way to achieve these dreams?"	E_I0
"For me, I prefer to focus on achieving the realistic goals rather than to follow the dreams even if the dreams are ambitious."	S_T0
"First, focusing on the realistic goals would not waste the time and the money, which is precious for the young people."	S_M1
"When we try to achieve the goals or the dream, we have to spend our time and money to be succesful."	B_S0
"But if the people's dream is not practical, which means that they can hardly achieve it, they would waste their time and money to fail."	I_S0
"For example, my brother liked to play the soccer when he was a child, so it was his dream to be a professional soccer player in the future."	I_S0
"So he decided to train with the school soccer team everyday and his parents spent a lot of money to employ the private coach to train him."	I_S0
"But he was not tallent in soccer, in fact, he was too weak to join the competition, and he had some illness innate."	I_S0
"Eventually, he achieved nothing when he was twenty-five years old, although he spent his whole youth and lots of money."	E_S0
"Second, focusing on realistic goals will motivate people to work hard and help people succeed finally."	S_M1
"The goals can actually make people know the direction about their future, and when they work hard to achieve all the realistic goals, they will finally be successful."	B_S0
"As we know, the realistic goals is easier to achieve by contrast and people always tend to be motivated when they achieve one goal."	I_S0
"So if people focus on achieving the realistic goals, they would be motivated by achieving one goal and try their best to achieve another one, and fianlly, the would be what they dream to be."	I_S0
"When my mother was a child, it was her dream to become a scientist."	I_S0
"But what she tried to achieve is not to be a professer in the university, but how to have a good grade to go to the best school."	I_S0
"Everytime she performed well in an exam, she was motivated to work hard to have a better grade in the next exam, and finally, she succeed to become a physical scientist."	E_S0
"So as I have said, focusing on the realistic is better than following the ambitious dreams."	S_C2
 
"With time going by, the standard of our life is promting, which is a good intency for our."	S_I0
"As a result, people are lving longer than before."	B_T1
"That is a wonderful thing for us for it brings more advantages."	E_T1
"The improving life expectancy gives us more time to fullfill our dream."	S_M2
"As great thinker had said that life is so short that we have little time to pursue our dream."	B_S0
"But as we can live longer, we now have time to do what we want."	I_S0
"I have read an news."	I_S0
"It may explanied that an old man is learning English when retired,because he has no time to study it when he is young."	I_S0
"Although we now have the ability to pursue our hobby, it is still difficult for us to do these things because the presures."	E_S0
"All in all, life is short, We can not do what we want now."	S_C2
"Given more time,it is still possible for us to fullfill our dream."	S_S2
 
"It is common that we award some scientists or some singers or actors because of their ipressing achievements."	B_I0
"We even give the amimals that are trained in the zoo."	I_I0
"As a result,  everybody needs reward."	E_I0
"Some people maight think that it will make children who work hard only for money, however, I am not in favour of this statement."	S_T1
"As far as I am concerned, it is not bad for children to deserve reward."	S_T0
"Here are my reasons."	S_T1
"Getting reward encourages students to work for higher grades."	S_M1
"It is nice for children get extra gift when they are envoled in study all day and all night."	B_S0
"In other words, if they cannot get reward after they get good grades, they will quit working hard because they are not aware of the importance of studying."	I_S0
"Especially for the one who are in low grade, they have not have the point of study for their future."	I_S0
"So, giving money quite motive them to get good grades."	E_S0
"On the one hand, the rewards, money given by parents, wil probably make kids get habits of mangement of  saving money."	S_M1
"It is wise for children who rise habit of making good use of money, in the meantime, the parents can as well get chance to educate them how to use the money."	B_S0
"On the other hand, the children will  also understand the meaning of earn for the staff they desire instead of asking parents to purchase for granted."	I_S0
"Take me for example, I exchange what I want by meanings of studying hard, it makes proud of myself."	E_S0
"Someone may wonder if money will lead students to cheat for highger grades in order to get money, however, it will not be a problem owning to train by teachers and parents from a very young age."	S_S2
"Nomatter which kind of reword, it needs proper level, too much or less will always genergate disadvantages to children."	S_C2
 
"Is it the best way to travel in a group with a tour guide?"	B_I0
"Can we have a great time in a group travel?"	I_I0

"As a result, from my perspective, the group travel is not a good choice."	S_T0
"On the one hand, the group travel restricts our free."	S_M1
"To be more specific, If we participate in a group travel, we will be restricted in a rigorous schedule that travel agency makes."	B_S0
"Consider myself for instance, last year, I participated in a group travel that called "7days travel in Hai Nan"."	I_S0
"However, although we went there with a good mood, we did not have a good time at that 7 days."	I_S0
"The first day we arrived there, and we felt extremely tired for the 5 hours riding in the high speed rail, but the guide also resisted to led us to visited a stone statue of Guanyin."	I_S0
"Dramastically, all of us just wanted to sleep or stroll nereby."	I_S0
"Finally, we still went to visited the Guanyin statues, but we felt boring and terrible."	I_S0
"Second day we even climbed mountains in a rainy day under the schedule."	I_S0
"Obviously, the compellent schedules do not benefit for us, the group travel is not a good choice."	E_S0
"On the other hand, the group travel is hazardous sometime."	S_M1
"To be more convincible, some of the small scales travel agency have some bad low-downs which are harmful for our porperty even the being."	B_S0
"For instance, these days a traveling group about 10 people in our country prepare to have a travel in Tailand."	I_S0
"However, they met a problem that the guides abused them and threaten them just since they did not consume enough money in a rubber market."	I_S0

"Besides, most of people have the good condition for watching or reding in thier own house instead of doing physical exercise which they have to go to the gym or garden."	I_S0
"Second, It can benefit people's work much by watching a movie or reading a book because you can gain some knowlegde during this which will be very usefull for your work even or daily life."	I_S0
"Compare to this, doing puysical exercise can only make your body stronger which has nothing good for your work usually."	E_S0

"If you make the friends with the bad guy, you may will change like him or you make the friends with the girl, who really like the make up, you may like make up too."	B_S0
"But it's really hard to change."	I_S0
"It need lots of times and many people who has the strong personality, cause you have you own peronality and it's not easy to change."	E_S0
"How to make your own personality?"	S_M1
"It's in your childhood, from your parents!"	B_S0
"Your parents speak are very polit, when you will never be rude."	I_S0
"And your parents are good at music, you will be really interest in music too."	I_S0
"And the personality make from your childhood, it's not easy to change."	I_S0
"They will meet the lots of different people in the future, but thet still will we themselves."	E_S0
"So I think the powerful influence on children's life is a bigger part then the influence from outside."	B_C1
"The parents is a really important part in their children's life."	E_C1

"As a consequence, shortage of potential and money, everyone's own life condition, and personal willingness can all be the reasons that they don't intend to help the strangers who are in struggle."	B_C0
"In the opposite, I reckon that people factually unwilling to help strangers due to this complex world nowadays."	I_C0

"The reading believes that human can impossible lived on Venus because the condition on there are too extreme."	B_I0
"However, this view is refused by the professor."	I_I0
"First, the reading asserts that the atmospheric pressure at Venus' surface is much more bigger than it on Earth."	I_I0
"On the contrary, the professor argues that in many places, the atmospheric pressure at Vnus is equal to the Earth."	E_I0
"Furthermore, according to the reading, there are only a few water and oxyger in the atmosphere in Venus."	S_M2
"Quite the opposite, the professor disagrees by saying that we could use chemical reaction to obtain water and oxygen."	B_S1
"He then elaborate that because most of the atmosphere in Venus is carbon dioxide and nitrogen, we could use them to obtain water and others we need in the atmosphere in Earth."	E_S1
"Finally, the reading maintains that only a little sunlight could arrive Venus' surface."	B_C1
"However, the professor refutes by pointing out that the sunlight above a level will be not very thick and we could also use the sunligjt which being reflected."	E_C1
 
"Recent years, many people believe that high school students should be involved in volunteering community services as a compulsory part of high school programmes."	B_I0
"Those unpaid works will contribute to set up their devotion and also enrich there working experience."	E_I0
"However, these are not reasonable."	B_T0
"In my point of view, doing such works may have few benefits but there will have various problems simultaneously."	E_T0
"Initially, as a student, acquiring knowledge and getting good grades are their primary goal."	S_M1
"Now days, students have to learn tons of knowledge, they even have little break time."	B_S0
"It is evident that doing unpaid community services will occupy their learning time."	I_S0
"Once I participated in a volunteering group, I had to cancel an after-school class and my learning time to make time for it."	I_S0
"My grades plunged and I had to drop out."	I_S0
"Volunteering works will distract your energy and do harm to your study."	E_S0
"Besides, it is well known that high school students are under great pressure of entering a good university."	S_M1
"They put their heart and soul into the college entrance examination and they are concerned about whether they can be enrolled in a good university, it will determine their lives."	B_S0
"One of my classmates had suicided due to the great pressure."	I_S0
"So that giving students compulsory works is not a reasonable idea, it will increase their pressure and endanger their mental health."	E_S0
"Above all, I think having high school students to do community services is unreasonable and unrealistic, it will just have side effects."	S_C2
 
"The issue of university students' study orientation has aroused a heated public discussion."	S_I0
"Some persist that the freedom to select courses is the most significant, while others contend that applied subjects associated with science and technology are what university students should learn."	S_T1
"Both sides are reasonable."	S_T0
"Individuals who insist on the first statement have a strong voice."	S_M1
"Firstly, the freedom to choose the subject that they are interested in can motivate students’ potentials to a fullest extent."	B_S0
"Students' interest in a particular field undoubtedly leads to their passion to explore and investigate, which may bring about achievements in this area."	I_S0
"Secondly, such freedom is more beneficial to students' all-round development."	I_S0
"It is undeniable that art courses cultivate students' tastes; math enhances logical thinking and analytical ability."	I_S0
"Some may argue that these benefits are irrelevant to practical skills that the applied subjects can bring to students."	I_S0
"It is, however, no doubt that practical skills without logic, analytical ability and so on are detrimental to students' future career."	E_S0
"These who hold the second statement have their sound reasons."	S_M1
"A key point lies in the fact that applied subjects can offer necessary human capital for economic growth."	B_S0
"Economic and social development, especially in those less developed countries, has created a huge demand for scientific and technological talents."	I_S0
"Therefore, university should devote financial resources to those applied subjects."	E_S0
"The discussion cited above demonstrates two viewpoints."	B_C0
"The former focuses on the importance of freedom to choose courses, while the latter concerns about the significance of applied subjects."	I_C0
"It is safe to conclude that to choose courses freely is more convincing."	E_C0
 
"Due to the continuous attention of the media, sports professionals in China have become stars and celebrities, and those at the top of the staff have been paid a lot."	B_I0
"Just like the beginning of the movie, they live a luxurious life with huge houses and cars."	E_I0
"Many people find their pay unfair, especially when they compare these high salaries with that of top surgeons or research scientists, or even political leaders with responsibility for governing the country."	S_M1
"However, sports pay is not determined by a person's contribution to society or his or her level of responsibility."	B_S0
"Instead, they reflect the general popularity of sports and the level of public support that successful stars can generate."	I_S0
"Therefore, the concept of "equity" is not the problem."	E_S0
"Those who think the starting salary of sports is reasonable may say that there are few really talented professionals, and the money is recognition of the skills and dedication required for a person's success."	S_M1
"Competition is eternal, and a player is tested every time in his relatively short career."	B_S0
"The pressure of the media is so great that there is almost no privacy in the spotlight."	I_S0
"Therefore, all of these factors may be the reason for huge profits."	E_S0
"Personally, I think the money made by such sports stars is more reasonable than that made by movie stars, but it also shows that our society attaches more importance to sports than to more important careers and achievements."	S_C2

"However, medical care is  likely to come out in elderly people."	I_T0
"Government have to spent more money on caring elderly people, and the budget that should use to other essential area ,such as education,  will be cut."	E_T0
"As a result, Gover nment have to collect  more money to satisfied its needs , and  this will put a heavy burden on taxpayers."	S_T1
"Besides, elderly people are more likely perform poorly in tackle information and works."	B_S0
"In order to earn a living ,elderly people have to  postpone their retirement, which pose a threat to society's productivity and efficiency."	I_S0
"Elderly people prolonging working life might hurt the economical growth."	E_S0
"On the other hand, that elderly people live longer than before has some positive effect on our society."	S_M2
"Elderly people are expert in their field  and their expertise are the treasury of society."	B_S0
"If they postpone their retirement , they can pass their expertisement to next generation."	I_S0
"For example , they can teach youth how to tackle throny problems and to motivate accopany to innovation."	E_S0
"In conclusion, since elderly people can contribute to society,  longer living brings society more disadvantages than advantages."	S_C2

"These are the reason why I disagree with this statement."	E_T0
"First, the future world will have the kinds of energy which are more clean than today's."	S_M0
"For example, the solar energy  is a kind of energy which can be used in twenty years."	B_S0
"There are some race cars in today's world use the solar energy, and they could run to 220 kilometers each hour."	I_S0
"In the future, the coefficient of utilization will be more useful than today's solar panels."	I_S0
"The hydrogen-drive vechles are also feasible."	I_S0
"We all know, if you plus hydrogen to the fire, there will be a lot of water comes out."	I_S0
"So the hydrogen-drive vechles' effluent will be the water."	I_S0
"And if you electrolysis the water, you will get the hydrogen and the oxgen."	I_S0
"And then plus a bit fire, you will get the water again!"	E_S0
"Second, in the future, the cars will be the multipurpose."	S_M0
"They would flys, runs or even swims!"	B_S0
"So the roads won't be the only  tracks for cars!"	I_S0
"So, you would see that, there will be more cars in the sky, on the land or even under the water!"	E_S0
"Third,in the next future, the space technology will take the great progress."	S_M0

"To the west of the pool lies the changing room, and to the east, the seating."	E_I0
"The other two parts are both outdoor courts, respectively on the west and east."	S_T1
"If achieved, in the future, the center will be largely expanded not only on its area but only on its facilities."	S_M2
"Suffice it to say, the main room of present remain intact, however, the two neighboring outdoor courts will be tottally romoved, with the east one transformed into two dance studios and the west one into a larger leisure pool."	B_S0
"The center will possess two changing rooms in the future rather than one at present, respectively situated at the southwest and the southeast part of the center."	I_S0

"In short, a lot of improvements are to be made in the center, and costumers' desire for better recreation will certainly be fufilled after the expansion."	S_C2

"The author clamed that it can benifit both the forest and the economy ."	B_T1
"However , the professor said that though salvage logging may be a way but it actually results longer environmental problems ."	E_T1
"She first of all stated that dead trees in fact add nutrients to the forest soil , which can help other plants grow better ."	S_M2
"As the passage mentioned , removing dead trees will give room for the forest plants , but as well will remove the nutrients and actually harm the environment ."	B_S0
"Secondly the speaker argued that dead trees hold more birds and insects that help plants live than bad insects ."	I_S0
"As the reading passage only mentioned the harmful ones , she stated that there are benificial animals and salvage logging may cause more serious damages ."	I_S0

"With sufficient social experiences and working skills, students may be more competitive in the job market after graduation in the foreseeable future."	E_S0

"By looking at the first chart,we can know that most of the student prefer have a further study after leaving college,the less decide to do a voluntary work,the others' choise is to do a part-time work or just to do nothing."	E_T1
"For the second picture,that is about the postgraduates,the population is more less,but the proportion of destination are almost the same,except the men doing a part-time work,this column's proportion is more than in the first chart."	B_M0
"Everybody knows that the UK is a developped country,it has a high level of education."	E_M0
"As we can see in these two pictures,more students prefer choose the further study,in order to have a job after the study of the college."	S_S2
"In my opinion,we should study more to improve ourselves."	S_M0
"In one hand,we can have a better work in the future;in anothor hand,we could increase our capability,and have a wonderful life."	S_S2
 
"I think it has some advantages anyway."	S_T1
"To be specific,this method can give children a strong desire to learn,at least in a short term."	B_T0
"So they can behave better in school,get better marks,learn more knowledge carefully."	I_T0
"And children can get more money,which they can use to develop their hobbies."	E_T0
"This may have the children a good idea about money."	S_T1
"However,this method do more harm than good."	S_M2
"A school-age child is on his developing stage."	B_S0
"If a child is taught in this way,he cannot get the meaning of learning,or worse,he would think he learns for his parents,for money."	I_S0
"He may be crazy for money when he grows up."	I_S0
"This is a dangerous thought,which may lead the child to a terrible way."	I_S0
"If this really happens,we did a terrible thing to the child."	I_S0
"Learning's meaning is learning itself."	I_S0
"This is the right motivation for a child to learn."	I_S0
"Only if a child can get this,he can learn carefully for a long time,even for his whole life."	I_S0
"The education,however,isn't about marks,even not about knowledge."	I_S0
"It's about to make a children to develop,to be better."	I_S0
"This education method is against the goal of education,which makes it a totally failed method."	E_S0
"In my opinion,children should be taught the meaning of learn first,be leading to the right way first."	B_C0
"After this,children can set a right goal and move forward in the right way automously."	I_C0
"This way,not only money is saved,but also children will have a healthier thought,have a brighter future."	I_C0
"To make children have a great thought,this is the real meaning of eduction,is it?"	E_C0
 
"Here are a pictuyre about the goods transported in UK."	S_T1
"The numble of road are rise from 1974 to 2002."	B_S0
"It from 70 to nearly 100."	I_S0
"That is a good thimg."	I_S0
"That means people have more way to go to different place."	I_S0
"Then, let us look at water."	I_S0
"From 1974 to 1966, water was growing at a small rate."	I_S0
"However, since 1990 to 1998,water was descreasing in a small rate."	I_S0
"That is not a good news."	I_S0
"Beacause when people alive, they need many water."	I_S0
"But the water was descreasing."	I_S0
"the best news,after 1998 ,the water become more ,that is a good thing."	I_S0
"After that,let us look at rail."	I_S0
"From 1974 to 2002, it has a little big rase."	I_S0
"Rail makes people travel more conveniet."	I_S0
"It also need to tear down some rail that is broken."	I_S0
"so it is normal to have this rate."	I_S0
"Finally, let us look at pipeline."	I_S0
"Pipeline make people lives more sanitary."	I_S0
"From 1974 to 2002 ,it becines more and more."	I_S0
"that means people have higher live quality."	I_S0

"In some countries today, there are more young people than older people."	S_I0
"In my opinion,the advantages of this phonomenon outweigh the disadvantages."	S_T1
"As for young people,first of all, I think the place with more young people  is more energetic."	B_T0
"The following is the topics that young people discuss are always advanced and representative,while older people may not know these."	E_T0
"They will create more opportunities for these places and it is cnductive to the development of the country."	B_S0
"Meanwhile, young people are able to provide more labour force for different jobs,such as waiter,manager."	I_S0
"this is a good condition for promoting economic development."	I_S0
"Finally,young people are the major coutomers, they are fond of buying a variety of things,they really boost the economic."	E_S0
"On the other hand,there are also numbers of disadvantages results from too many young people."	S_M1
"Firstly,more and more population is a major negative influence."	B_S0
"As a result,this will consume more resources in our lives."	I_S0
"In addition to this,there will be more pressure onyoung people."	I_S0
"For example,work,employmentand marriage."	I_S0
"And relative to the elders,they have less experiences,this will cost them  in different aspects in lives."	E_S0
"Comparingyoung people with the old people,although the young people have some shortcomings,they still play a promoting role in many aspects of economic and social life."	S_M1
"Their role is important and irreplaceable."	S_S2
"Overall,there are more advantages to having more young people thanold people."	S_C2
 
"It is beyond reproach that roads are the basis of transportation, no matter for metro system, vehicles or trains."	B_I0
"Therefore, while other people support to give priority to use more expenditure on railway system, I disagree with such perspective."	I_I0
"To my mind, both of the roads in street and in rail deserve equal attention of authorities."	E_I0
"To begin with, perfecting the roads in city or rural area provide non-negligible benefits for residents."	S_M1
"Firstly, the construction of even roads for vehicles and non-motorized vehicles can effectively reduce the incidence rate of traffic accidents."	B_S0
"Therefore, such practice is conducive to protect the drivers."	I_S0
"Secondly, a sensational traffic structure in city will ease the traffic congestion especially in the rush hours."	I_S0
"For example, the government can widen the roads or place more traffic lights in the blocks."	I_S0
"Consequently, when the commuting time is shorten, citizens' life standard will be promote."	E_S0
"Anyway, railways also play an imperative role of the development in the city."	S_M1
"The railway system as one of the essential sectors in transport industry is charged responsibilities of transmitting goods and passages to or out certain areas."	B_S0
"Namely, such kinds of transport tool always associates with tourism and trade."	I_S0
"As a result, we can safely achieve the conclusion that governments need give financial supports to complete the railroads so as to facilitate the development of economic."	E_S0
"In a nut shall, railways and roads as two vital parts of transportation should not be fail to attach governments' attention."	B_C1
"Besides, they both need funds to be perfect and to meet the demands of residents and development pace."	E_C1
 
"In recent years, many people will choose to change their local jobs, or even industry jobs."	B_I0
"However whether the benefit is less clear."	E_I0
"From my perspective, I am largely supportive of view that there are more advantages to work for the different  organisations."	S_T1
"Firstly,in many cases ,individuals believe that the change in technology and business bring amount opportunities but also pose serious challenges."	S_M0
"For young people, challenges and opportunities are good things."	B_S0
"For example, a teacher should not only be able to teach, but also to use multimedia to teach."	I_S0
"In fact, most teachers will have the basic knowledge of computer, which is conducive to they cross industry to work."	E_S0
"The second is that changing jobs is good for migration, which is undoubtedly good for society as a whole."	S_M0
"And then will make the replacement of talents from all walks of life conducive to the development of the industry."	S_S2
"The different kinds of talents can make different contributions to different industries."	S_M0
"However, many people do not want to change jobs or industries because they are afraid of change,which can make them feel uncomfortable and unhappy."	B_C1
"This is full of many unpredictable uncertainties."	E_C1
"Meanwhile changing jobs may lead to other changes in your life that people might adapt to."	S_S2
 
"Nowadays, a controverisal topic about teachers' income has aroused attentions among the people from evey walk of life."	B_I0
"Some people think that teachers' income is too high, which may cause financial burden for school."	E_I0
"However, I think teacher should be paid as leat as much as some decent professionals like doctors, lawyers or bussiness leaders."	S_T1
"First, there is no doubt that teacher is the one of the most important role in society."	S_M2
"This is because they can impart their knowledge and life experience to students, who may be devoted themselves to the society and construct their home."	B_S0
"For example, Tao Xingzhi ,the famous teacher in China has taught about 20 years in the high school."	I_S0
"Many of his students learned a lot of knowledge from him, which lay a good foundation for their future study."	I_S0
"When the students finished their advanced education in the university, most of them dedicated their whole life to the New China construction, such as Dun Jiaxian ,a famous scientist found nuclear fission which made the nuclear power plants come true in China."	I_S0
"If our society give teachers more payment, it is safe to say that many good teacher as well as Mr Tao will be found because there will be more young people to oocupy in professional as teacher."	E_S0
"Second, high salary may make teacher more absorb themselves in teaching."	B_C1
"To illustrate, with high salary,teachers will not consider  basic life essensials like buying houses and tuitions of children."	E_C1
"So they may consentrate all their energy to teach."	B_S0
"For example, there are some teachers in remote area of China."	I_S0
"Everyday, they have to some part-time jobs to susutain their life."	E_S0
"As a result, they will have little time to prepare for teaching mater"	O
 
"This chart shows the consumption of energy in Ameriaca during the period from 1980 to 2030."	S_I0
"It is evident that the consumption of petrol and oil was decreased form 35 quadrillion units in 1980 to 30 in 1985, before it fluctuated to 43 in 2020."	S_M2
"And it is predicted that the consunption of petrol and oil will be increase constantly to 47 in 2030."	B_S0
"Moreover, the consumption of natural gas was increased from 20 in 1980 to 24 in 2002, while it has been fluctuated to 23 in 2020."	I_S0
"And it will remain stable in the future."	I_S0
"Futhermore, there was an increasing tendency in consumption of coal from 1980 (16) to 2020 (24)."	I_S0
"And it is predicted that it will increase steadily in the future to 28 in 2030."	I_S0
"In addition, the consumptions of nuclear, solar/wind and hydropower are similar, which are all under 7 quadrillion units during the period between 1980 and 2030."	E_S0
"In summary, American people consume most petrol and oil during the period from 1980 to 2030."	S_C2
"However, they consume least fuel of nuclear, solar/wind and hydropower."	S_S2
 
"Nowadays,there are more people prefer to relax by watching a movie or reading a book rather than taking exercise,because they think it is an old-fashioned approach to relax by taking exercise."	B_T1
"In my oninion,taking exercise still 
play an essential role in our lives ."	E_T1
"First and foremost,health is the most vital factor for people to live."	S_M0
"People are able to strengthen their power to make themselves healthier by taking exercise."	B_S1
"However,if people just stay in theatre to see a movie,they might be uncomfortable due to the long-term rediation."	E_S1
"Furthermore,it is an effective manner for people to broaden their horizon by coming out and doing exercise."	S_M0
"For example,I always go out to take exercise,once I met a lot of friends who also take the same exercise as me and we comunucated with each others a lot."	B_S0
"Therefore I made many new friends by taking exercise."	I_S0
"In contrast,if I just stay at to read a book ,I will never make so many friends and improve my communication skills."	E_S0
"Finally,there could be some stressful student who would like to relax but without sufficient money to watch movie or buy book."	S_M0
"Therefore,the best way to relax themselves without much charge is taking exercise."	B_S1
"Because they just need to get out of their house and do any sports they want."	E_S1
"To sum  up,it is more beneficial to take exercise than to watch a movie or read a book for relaxation."	B_C1
"If people were stressful ,why not choose to take exercise to lower the pressure?"	E_C1
 
"I agree with the statement that it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise."	B_I0
"Here are my opinion below."	I_I0
"Nowadays Chinese students have lots of pressure from their academy work."	I_I0
"Most of them do not have much time on their  hobbies,such as playing basketball or watching a fantastic movie."	I_I0
"Amout of homework will not keep their physical and emotinal health."	I_I0
"Therefore,they need to go outside when they having the relax time."	I_I0
"I also suggest these students to go the cinema to have a good time on a movie."	I_I0
"It will open their mind and expand their imaginations."	I_I0
"Some of the movies are speaking English,and it can improve their ablility of expression."	I_I0
"Reading books in English is also a good way for them to realx."	I_I0
"Students can learn the grammar and a lot of vocabulary in one book."	E_I0
"Both of them are active for students' devlopment in future."	S_T1
"Doing some physical exercises in the spare time is a nice suggestion,but we can not just only do this work when we relaxed."	S_M2
"we should take more foucus on study."	B_S0
"So watching a movie or reading a book is much better than doing physical exercise."	I_S0
"I have someown experience for doing physical exercise."	I_S0
"When I have done some physical exercise like playing basketball or golf,I can not take 100 percent attraction on study working."	I_S0
"However,I always can get a lot of power of study when I have read a book."	I_S0
"The mainly reason of this is the hero in the book can inspire me have the passion on my study,but I could only feel tiered when I played the physicl exercises."	E_S0
"In addition,I suppose watching a movie or reading abook is the better way of relax than doing physical exercise."	S_C2
"We can get more active power when we hve done the form"	O
 
"I think this is a good idea."	S_T1
"First,it can make their school-age children have energe to study."	B_S0
"For us student,study is obviously less interesting than playing,so money can let students spend more time on studying."	I_S0
"If their children want to get the money,they should study hard,then they will learn more."	I_S0
"Second,giving their money can help them know how to deal with them."	I_S0
"I think if their parents teach them how to use the money,they will know importance of keeping money and will not use the money in wrong ways."	I_S0
"Finally,in my opinion,if parents can do this correctly,giving money as presents could become a good idea to encourage their kids to study hard and get high grade."	E_S0
 
"Goods transported in UK
  As we can see from the graph, the quantities of goods transported in the UK have been increasing gradually."	S_T1
"The quantities of transporting by road, such as bus, car, are the most all the time."	B_S0
"And its tendency is increasing."	I_S0
"As for transported by water,corresponded with the transportation means ship, the number is the second most of the time."	I_S0
"We can see that from 1978 to 1982 and from 1998 to 2002, the number increased rapidly,while there is not a big change other time."	I_S0
"Then I'd like to talk about rail, the traditional transportation method."	I_S0
"It is the only one whose quantities of goods makes no improvement."	I_S0
"Before 1994, there even remains a reducement."	I_S0
"Thankfully, recent years, it is increasing gradually."	I_S0
"The last transportation method is pipeline,its quantities of transport goods is the least all the time."	I_S0
"Before1995 ,though its quantities is the least ,it kept on increasing."	I_S0
"However, from 1995,the tendency of increasing has disappeared."	I_S0
"From the gragh, we have a understanding of the goods transported in the HK,and it is important."	E_S0
 
"A current worrying situation is that a number ofgraduates can not be employed after their university education."	S_T1
"In the case of that,it is a huge debate that the purpose of universities should be provide students with skills in the work place or just give knowlege."	B_S0
"One the one hand,graduates need to learn some applied knowledge in order to deal with the challenge in the future workplace."	I_S0
"Nowadays,people seems paying too much for pursuing a good score and ignoring the fact they are eventually enter the society which needs to have some applied knowledge to help them fitting in."	I_S0
"After they leave the school and enter a company,they finally realize they lacks working knowledge,and this will cause an amount of troubles to their career lives."	I_S0
"Therefore,univertities should consider providing knowlege and skills needed in the workplace rather then just some theoretical knowledge."	I_S0
"On the other hand,it would be also inappropriate to provide graduates with too much applied knowledge."	I_S0
"Schools have always been places where people can pursue their dedication to knowledge,which is advantageous for human civilization."	I_S0
"If universities change their goal to provide emplyment skills to student,students who merely want to pursue knowledge will lack many opportunities."	I_S0
"It is essential that universities to find a perfect balance point to provide both pure knowledge and employment skills."	I_S0
"We can come to a conclusion that depite universities is committed to provide students with knowledge,providing students various courses can also solve the problem."	I_S0
"Only in this way,students can not only finish their dedication to knowledge,but also to accomplish the difficulties they will faced in the future."	E_S0

"However, I totally disagree with the accusation against the government."	S_T1
"To begin with, every one should be responsible for their own eating habits."	S_M0
"If people don’t listen to the call for the importance of nutrition and healthy eating, the government cannot develop such a kind of education among the public."	B_S0
"Especially in the last generation, most of them used to live in a impoverished environment with limited food."	I_S0
"They are accustomed to eat as many food as they could to prevent from hungry."	I_S0
"Although the government has paid more attention to the health of these old people and even the family points out their wrong eating habits, it’s hard for them to change the whole concept."	E_S0
"Moreover, the government has done enough work to educate the contemporary people, especially children."	S_M0
"Whenever open the pages, turning on the television or logging onto the internet, we can constantly receive messages from lots of advertisements and articles about the importance of nutrition and healthy eating."	B_S0
"For example, my mother is really favour of watching related television programs about how to cook food, allocate the nutrition of food and even the timing of the intake."	I_S0
"Furthermore, the primary schools and kindergartens will educate children to attach importance to healthy eating at very young age."	I_S0
"And the idea of healthy eating has been incorporated into most textbooks."	E_S0
"Admittedly, majorities of city dwellers, especially those white-collar, are enslaved by diversified diseases, such as obesity and digestive problems, because they have unhealthy eating habits."	S_M0
"However, the problem comes from the pressure from a large amount of workload."	B_S0
"Young people choose to eat unhealthy fast food or gobble meals in order to save time on their work rather than not pay attention to the healthy eating."	I_S0
"The government should pay attention to the work arrangement instead."	E_S0
"In conclusion, I firmly believe that the government has done enough work to teach people the significance of nutrition and healthy eating."	S_C2
 
"Nowadays,many people argue about education way,some parents think competitions are very important in their kids life to co-operate with their classmates."	S_T1
"Personally,I agree with the latter."	B_S0

"It is true that competition are significant in our life."	I_S0
"As far as I know."	I_S0
"Competition can make students to become more and more stonger."	I_S0
"If their is a competition,that must have someone fail in the contend,but if they always win,they will easy get pround and they will setbacks."	I_S0
"The loser can get lots of experience is important and failure breeds success."	I_S0
"Everyone take part in competition when they grow up,it is a great chance let them know that."	I_S0

"If he had not worked so hard, he should not had been a successful person."	E_S0
"On top of that, there are so many popular career, in the past, extined now."	S_M1
"This is primarily because the evolution of tecnology too fast."	B_S0

"Second, professional staff who are working around there may also be bothered by these lay travellers if they are too noisy enjoying their trips."	I_S0
"Staffs should rescue travelers when they are in danger, which is time-consuming and requires more labour, so the worker in the remote natural area will have greater working burden."	I_S0
"Also, as the is development increases the trevellers, and there are all sorts of endangered animals living in remote natural areas, the animals' normal live willbe effected."	I_S0
"The less lay people get to those places, the better lives they will live."	I_S0
"Those animals are 'native dwellers', for example, penguins in South Pole, or polar bears in North Pole."	I_S0
"In case numerous construction for human has been built to meet the demand of the rising population coming there, the original environment of those 'native dwellers' will be harmed."	I_S0
"Should the urban pollutant be brought to the natural area with people together?"	I_S0
"Of course, no."	I_S0

"When it comes to prasise from parents, as far as i'm concerned, there are many choices better than money, such as hug, little presents, free times amd so on."	I_T1
"Following are my reasons:
First of all, giving money as high marks will help to grow children's venality, which is harmful to student's growth."	I_T1
"Children will tend to attach studying to material rather than accomplishment."	I_T1
"They are tend to Second, it may enhance the comparing phenomenon between teenagers, thus more and more students will focus on external apperance, luxury things, etc."	E_T1

"The graph indicates the quantities of products transferred by four different transport methods in theUK from 1974 and 2002."	S_T1
"The goods transported by road were always the biggest among the four modes and increased dramatically from 70 millions tones to nearly 100 millions tones throughout the whole time period."	B_S0
"Products carried by water followed a similar pattern as the road and gained the second largest popularity."	I_S0
"From 1978 to 2002, the quantity of goods transported by water climbed slightly and stopped at 62 milliions tones from 39 millions tones."	I_S0
"Similary,  pipeline transported increasely more products than before."	I_S0
"However, it was still the least popular way to transport goods among the four products and none of the year the quantity was over 22 million tones."	I_S0
"However, the quantity of products transport in the UK by the rail decreased during the year 1974 and 1994."	I_S0

"Nowadays, the industrialization has dramatically facilitated the growth of the population in the world."	S_I0
"It is obvious that it has become a global issue for human beings, resulted from varieties of reasons."	B_T1
"However, it is not substantial to conclude that the world's population is the greatest one."	E_T1
"There are some reasonable explanations that can deduce the continuous rise of population."	S_M1
"Firstly, the improvement of medical treatment tremendously diminishs the mortality of humans."	B_S0
"The relatively parcific societies and the rapid development of the technology provide fundamental support for the medical care, which means more people can avoid die from common illnesses like flus and heart diseases."	I_S0
"In addition, in the earlier period since World War II, there was a colossal demand for labours, which fostered the introduction of new laws encouraing people to feed more babies, especially in some poor regions throughout the world."	E_S0
"It is widely known to us that the world population has got far more close to the maximum of environmental capacity, and it really leads to a series of issues."	S_M1
"For example, the shortage of resources such as water, food and energy resource, has severely posed a threat to the survival of human beings, especially in developing countries."	B_S0
"However, there are also other problems equally emergent comparing with population growth, which is highly needed to be looked into."	I_S0
"For instance, the global climate changes."	E_S0
"Climate changes in every part of the world have directly influenced the habitat of both animals and humans themselves."	B_C0
"The over-emession of greenhouse gases like the mathane and carbon dioxide results in the greenhouse effects, raising up the temperature of the earth surface and thereby causing the melting of glaciers as well as the extinction of some delegate species."	I_C0
"It is obvious that climate changes are just as deleterious as overloaded population, which has negative impacts on the ecosystem and human societies in different aspects."	E_C0
 
"Nowadays, the social economy develops very fast and the amount of the minutes of telephone calls in the UK is cared by people."	S_I0
"During the chart, we can find easily that there are three categories in it and these are the details I want to say."	S_T0
"The three categories include local, national and international and mobiles."	S_M2
"From 1995 to 1998, the number of minutes of telephone calls used in mobiles rose slowly but it increased very fast in the next years to 2002."	B_S0
"Meanwhile, the number of minuted used by the national and international telephone calls in UK  increased normally during 1995 and 2002."	I_S0
"Finally, the minutes used by the local telephone calls increased from 1995 to 1998, but it declined in the next four years."	E_S0

"The line graph shows the amounts of energy consumed in the USA from 1980 to 2030,categorized by six fuel sources."	S_I0
"The consumption of petrol and oil was 35 quadrillion units in 1980,which was followed by an upward trend to 42q in 2015,in spite of some fluctuation."	S_M0
"Then, teh data is expected to continue,reaching 50q in 2030."	S_S2
"Similarly,there was also a rise in the amounts of coal and natural gas used in the USA from nearly 16q and 20q respectively in 1980 to roughly 22q in 2015, after which the former is projected to go up to 30q by 2030 while the latter will stabilize."	B_M0
"In contrast,the data of nuclear, solar and wind, and hydro power almost remained stable and are predicted to level off at approximately 5q ."	E_M0

"In recent years, some people think that family infulence is the most important on  new generations' life."	B_I0
"While some others consider that the impact from the outside world is more important for children's development, so they encourage their children to stand on their own feet away from home."	E_I0
"Personal thinking, I agree with this thought."	S_T0
"It is undoubtable that children's family can (and usually will) give a very mighty influence on children's personality and life development, as they usually need to spend around 1/5 of their whole lifetime with their parents at home (from 0 to 18 years old)."	S_M1
"Parents obviously have lots of  time to educate and impact their children, or make thir life become "what they want it to look like"."	S_S2
"While it is also undebatable that children's own experience from outside can give themselves strong influence, or even change their lives."	S_M1
"First, there are far more uncertain factors from outside than at home, every person they meet(include their friends, teachers, or even strangers)have a chance to impact their future development forcefully."	B_S0
"Second, when children are outside, they are experiencing and undergoing those events personally (which may be able to influence them more), not like when they are at home which they learn from the examples given by their parents."	I_S0
"Third, as most children need to go to school every day (except on statutory holidays), on a daily perspective, children spend more time outside than at home, so they can get more impacts from outside."	E_S0
"In a nutshell, although family has a very mighty influence on children's future development, children's own experience outside from their home can still infulence themselves more."	S_C2

"The line of pipeline is not very good because it was just two or three millions in1974 but with the development of science and technology,it has already increased to more than 20 millions in 2002."	I_S0
"In the future,I think the development of the pipeline will get better and better."	I_S0

"However, I strongly disapprove with the standpoint."	S_T1
"After considering about the personal achievement and money saving, I believe specializing in one specific subject is better."	S_T0
"First of all, there is not doubt that working in one specific subject for a long time is eaiser for individuals to achieve a higher personal achievement."	S_M1
"As the more time you put in your study, the more you will get to know about this subject."	B_S0
"The degree your undertanding about this project determines the acme you can reach."	I_S0

"Therefore, as far as I am concerned, economic progress is not the most essential aim for governments, but the life quality of their citizens."	E_T1
"First and foremost, good living conditions can enhance the progress of civilization."	S_M1
"As is universally acknowledged, renovations like technologies or great ideas lead to prosperous time, and that boost the economic incomes in return."	B_S0
"See the great times of navigation as an example, it is a sure thing that the money was never the motivation for the biggiest invester in Portugal, the Queen, but other rewards for her nation-- new lands resources and labors--was."	I_S0
"Not putting the economiacal growth in the first place,  the Portugal had a priviledge in the further conflicts with its enemies."	I_S0
"In this way, the pursuit to higher civilization, rather than the short-sightseeing want of money, did good to the goverment."	I_S0
"While money indeed can help a certain range of people to learn and create, they cannot prompt the new things to pop up, not to mention the further development for the govern."	E_S0
"Second, nice living environment is going to make people's lifespan longer."	S_M1
"Think how much will a society pays to build up a competent individual, and how long will he or she serves the counterpart?"	B_S0
"Apparently, sustaining a person's longer life can make fuller use of one's labor during his or her healthy whole life, comparing with irrational draining the one to death in a short period."	I_S0
"Besides, some great discoveries or breakthroughs are usually found in the inventors' sunset years since they had more knowledges and skills to do so."	I_S0

"From my perspective,I am firmly confirmed that increasing the number of sports facilities would have little effect on improving public health."	B_I0
"There are some reasons supporting my opinion."	E_I0
"Above all,the awareness of keeping healthy is the key to improving poblic health."	B_T1
"As a result,with the increasing of the quantity of sport facilities,there is no guarantee that public health will be improved certainly."	E_T1
"What's more,when the number of sports facilities is increased,it is the needs of space and facilities that are met while the the factors like time are ignored apparently."	S_T0
"Last but not least,to be honest,most of the people prefer working out in the  gym  for a better exercise conditions,so the increasing number of sports facilities will fail to improve the whole public health."	S_T1
"In this case,other measures are required due to public health."	S_M2
"First of all,government have the responsibility to emphasis the importance of the public health through educational advertisements and so on."	B_S0
"Meanwhile,other than the increase of the number of sports facilities,the quality of sports facilities is worth paying attention to actually."	I_S0
"Plus,if some companies choose not to squeeze the time of their employees,there will be more time left for people to do some sports and exercise,thus benefiting their health."	E_S0
"In a summary,what influence the public health most is not the increasing number of sports facilities,and a variety of measures should be taken to improve public health."	S_C2

"For example, you can enjoy the familiar fast food even when we come to Africa, watch films and buy the familiar cosmetics when we go to the shop, which brings us great convenience in the travel."	S_S2
"This makes the cultural communication more convenient, and the languages, customs, laws and regulations of different countries become more similar, which eliminates the barriers to cultural communication."	S_M1
"Therefore, I think it is a positive development."	S_S2
 
"In recent years, the earth's environment has been seriously damaged."	B_I0
"And these are mostly caused by humans."	E_I0
"However, there are different opinions about the major environmental problems."	S_T0
"But in my opinion the loss of particulai species of plants and animals is the most important environmental problem."	S_T1
"When a plant withers and an animal dies, it sometimes means not just the disappearance of a single living organism, but the extinction of an entire species."	S_M1
"Around the world, biological species are disappearing at an unprecedented rate."	B_S0
"And some of those species are extinct."	I_S0
"Generally refers to the species of plants or animals not renewable loss or destruction, known as species extinction."	I_S0
"Moreover, some experts say humans are not necessarily the main cause of the extinction."	I_S0
"Some people do not deny that, from the point of view of evolution, extinction of species is a natural law, such as the giant panda population is in a state of decline."	I_S0
"However, since the emergence of human beings, especially since the industrial revolution, the earth's population has been constantly increasing, the need for more and more means of livelihood, the scope of human activities has become larger and larger, and the interference to nature has become more and more."	I_S0
"So, a large number of forests, grasslands, rivers disappeared, replaced by roads, farmland, reservoirs and so on."	I_S0
"The natural habitat of living things is fragmented by traces of human activity."	I_S0
"Some scientists estimate that, without human interference, an average of 90 vertebrate species would have died out every 100 years and an average of one higher plant species would have died out every 27 years over the past 200 million years."	I_S0

"It is caused by the continuous accumulation of greenhouse effect, which leads to the imbalance between the energy absorbed and emitted by the surface gas system."	I_S0
"The energy constantly accumulates in the surface gas system, resulting in the rise of temperature and global warming."	I_S0
"As people burn fossil fuels, such as oil, coal, etc., or cutting down forests and burning it would produce large amounts of carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas, these greenhouse gases to the high permeability of the visible light radiation from the sun, and the long wave radiation emitted on the earth are highly absorbent, can strongly absorb radiation in the infrared ground, causing the earth's temperature rises, the greenhouse effect."

"I think the fast food is nessary for people."	I_S0
"There are various reasons why I have this view and the evident one is that nowadays, people sometimes have no enough time to have meals."	I_S0
"So, the fast food is more convenient for them."	I_S0
"For example, a large number of people are busy with works and the work always need them to devote themselves attention to it so that they can't stop it to have meal."	I_S0
"At this moment, fast food is a better choice for them."	I_S0
"An alternative reason is that the fast food relatively cheap and most people could afford it."	I_S0
"It means, people usually meet a situation that they may have financy problem in the end of moth."	I_S0
"At that time, they coudn't choose others which have more energy and more healthy."	I_S0
"While the fast food generally cheaper than healthy food."	I_S0
"In spite of those advantages of fast food, I have to admit eating too much fast food be harmful to people's health, because the fast food has more additive and nearly has no nutrition."	I_S0
"So some people consider that raising the tax pf junk food could reduce the negative effect on peoples health, because if having a higher tax, the junk food price will be higher,people may not chose it for meal."	I_S0
"However, this approach may never cope with this problem."	I_S0
"And in some situation, people need this kind of food to survive forthe cheap price of it."	I_S0
"In conclusion, I disagree this point."	I_S0

"If we build up variety of sport facilities, then people would be more willing to spend time in these facilities to train their bodies and to improve their fitness, instead of living a sedentary life at home watching television, playing video games or using computers."	I_S0
"However, the building of such facilities may become a waste of time , if they are built far away from where people live or if they are too expensive to use."	I_S0
"There are scenes of empty sports grounds in many cities because it takes too much trouble to get there, In these cases, the government should be spending more on advertising healthier life style instead of just wasting money on facilities that are not going to be actively used by the people."	I_S0

"In the other hand, it is Science and Technology that play a significant role in development of a country."	I_S0
"Especially those developing countries which are lack of technological innovations can not provide such a good platform to do research."	I_S0
"If they encourage young students from studying science, they will be more likely to contribute to national development."	I_S0
"Consequently,the country would be much more stronger in a long run."	I_S0
"From my perspective,students are encouraged from studying Science is more advisable."	I_S0

"All of these are due to the government's sumpyuous money help to the Internet access and I feel easier to touch the Internet to explore someting new in it which make me never outgoing and optimistic."	E_S0
"Compared with the outcome of getting money help from the government, it is obviously that improve public transportation will only lead to positive effects, but improve Internet access will both have nagetive and positive outcomes."	S_M0
"Thus, why not try to spend more money on the public transprotation, including the lack of buses, the speed of subway, the poisonous gas generated by cars and so on."	B_S1

"From my perspective, although the loss of particular species of plant and animals is an irreversible event indeed, there are more important environmental issues in our time."	S_T1
"Due to a series of human activities, many species of plant and animals face a serious problem."	S_M1
"As the development of technology, the demand of resources has increased rapidly, which means we need to cut down more forests and acquire more oil in the sea, leading to the damage of plants and animals in the world."	B_S0
"Besides, as the increase of economy, there are more and more factories all over the world which produce a plenty of waste into the lake."	I_S0
"As a result, fish and other creatures will die for it."	E_S0
"What is more important than the lose of plants and animals is the envionmental problems will finally affect human beings' lives."	S_M1
"For example, as we all know, too much carbon dioxide emissions can cause global warming, which means some countries and cities located in the coastline will be floaded by the rising sea level in the future."	B_S0

"These employees can continue to get promotions and raises based on their work time and contribution to the company."	I_S0
"What's more, they think stable jobs are better than high-paying ones."	I_S0
"As long as you work long enough and accumulate enough experience, you can get a good salary."	E_S0
"There are also a large number of people who are not satisfied with the current job, they will often change jobs."	S_M0
"There are two reasons for this."	B_S0
"The first reason is that working for the same company for a long time without being recognized by the employer makes it less and less possible to get a pay raise."	I_S0
"The second reason is that it is clear that the jobs advertised by other firms pay better than the ones they have now."	E_S0
"In my opinion, the most important thing when choosing a job is to see whether the company has a good development prospect rather than the current salary."	S_M0
"When you think about it and realize that your skills and salary haven't improved over time at your current company, it's not always a bad idea to change jobs."	S_S2

"Nowadays, people perfer to make thieir journey with a group and led by a tour guide."	B_I0
"Undoubtedly, this could be the best way for our tour."	I_I0
"The tour guide is able to help travellers to order the right dish when they cannot speak native langauge."	E_I0
"Also, guide can tell is to go to the Britian Museum instead of other boring places when we are travelling in England."	S_T0
"Then, guide can make a tour schedule which most fit the travellers time."	B_T1
"All of these are brought by the guide."	E_T1
"First, tour guide can speak native language, which will play a significant role in our journey."	S_M1
"Some investigations shows that almost ninety percent of travellers choose to tour with a guide, and more than a half of them thinks guide's ability to speak native language is the most important since the travel group can make travellers have no probelm when they want to express their needs."	B_S0
"For example, when you need to buy some products when you travel abroad, such as perfume, tissue at forth."	I_S0
"How can you even buy it if you are not capable in saying them in the right expression."	I_S0
"That's where the guide show their importance."	E_S0
"Secondly, guide can show me some more intersting place especially in some places I have never been."	S_M1
"For example, I have went to England with some of my friends."	B_S0
"In the forth day of the trip, I told the guide I preferred to go somewhere I liked rather than following the group, then the guide agreed, which made me very regretful."	I_S0
"I went to a town which is unknown to most people, and all I could do was just wandering around and seeing the passengers, which is boring."	I_S0
"Since then, I decided to follow the guide every time I went out with group since the guide was more familiar with the places we went than us, which could provide much better experience."	E_S0
"Last, some people may argue that the travelling with a group can limit our time and through other travelling ways the time management is better."	B_C0
"Take one of my journeys for instance, I still travelled with my friends."	I_C0
"Without the guide nearby, we could hardly manage our time properly, because we could sleep till ten am or elven am, which would make the plan for the morning useless."	E_C0
"Because our laziness, the trip will become a very boring one if the guide is not nearby"	O
 
"Above all , what I want to say is that I strongly approve of this statement, of which the reasons are as follows."	S_T1
"First of all, living in a country where you have to speak a foreign language may cause a lot of living barriers to your everyday life in the society ,such as the failure of communicating with the supermarket staff or cabbie."	B_S0
"For example, if you go to a restaurant ,then you will find that you cannot understand the recipe without illustration ."	I_S0
"What's worse , the lack of abilities to communicate with waiters smoothly also seems to be a problem which can't be neglected."	I_S0
"What's more, it is also not easy to make friends and keep long friendship with people in the foreign country due to the existence of language barriers."	I_S0
"Imagine you are in a party with your foreign friends ,everyone taking, joking and laughing,but you even can't understand quickly what they are saying ,then how can you penetrate into the pleased atmosphere?"	I_S0
"Besides,  when you live in a country where you can only see foreign language , naturally your reaction to information and messages will slow down ,which leads to the fact that your effeciency of study and work will inevitably get worse ."	I_S0
"For instance, many exchange students will feel obviously nervous and stressed after they go to foreign countries ,and the increasing difficulty of normal studying or abtaining knowledge seems to become unavoidable."	I_S0
"To sum up, I hold the belief that living in a forign country can more or less lead to many social and practical problems ."	E_S0
 
"Now some studies have found that several minority languages are extinct every year."	B_I0
"However, some people are indifferent to this phenomenon, believing that it can reduce the gap between people from different cultural backgrounds."	E_I0
"From my point of view, the disadvantage of this trend is far greater than the convenience it brings."	S_T1
"Obviously, the whole world now tends to be more united and cooperative, which is also what we often call globalization."	S_M1
"This has resulted in the integration of different cultures."	B_S0
"Many countries have introduced foreign cultures and even languages and abandoned their own cultures to integrate into globalization."	I_S0
"Although traditional languages die out with the passing of the older generation, some regions have made economic progress through this extreme learning method, narrowing the gap between industrialized countries, which has indeed made it easier to live and communicate."	E_S0
"However, I think the disappearance of secondary languages is a huge loss, not only for some ethnic groups but also for the entire human race."	S_M1
"As a precious cultural heritage, language was created and improved by the older generation."	B_S0
"It is a precious treasure left to us by our ancestors."	I_S0
"By using it constantly and making it energetic, people can use it to create more benefits in spirit and body, making life and emotional expression easier."	I_S0
"Language is not just its definition."	I_S0
"Each language has its own specific speech system, involving everyone's different thinking, expression and even all aspects of life."	I_S0
"So from this perspective, people will not live as easily as expected."	I_S0
"A country without its own language is like a big tree without roots."	E_S0
"In addition, language is also an important part of cultural image."	B_C0
"Each language represents the image and culture of each different nation or even country."	I_C0
"The world is becoming more and more developed now, but only a country with its own characteristics in economy and culture can convince the world that it is an excellent and respectable country."	E_C0

"it is the common knowndge that early education infulune the whole life of the children."	S_T1
"So the topic relating to whether hearsh punishment could be regarded as a guideline to help children distinguish right and wrong has been incresingly heating up."	B_S0
"as for me, i cannot agree with this opinion."	I_S0
"it can be little doubt that edcation for children play a significant role in teenagers life, espacially when they are young."	I_S0
"family and teacher should be strict to the children in developing good habits in both study and life as well as forstering the moral values so that they could be well-bing in  the furture."	I_S0
"altough the strict edcation is neede, it can be form in various ways, and the punishment might be the worst choice."	I_S0
"firstly, punishmennt are not benefit to pupils physical and psychological health."	I_S0
"as well all know that children' charecters have not been developed , espeacilly for those who are in the poeiriod of adolecence."	I_S0
"harsh pushing liking beating and abusing might leave  shades to them."	I_S0
"some pupils are pushied witout being guilded in right way would become more illuate and odd."	I_S0
"further more the feeling of hosilty to the family, school and even soeicty would be established."	I_S0
"the second thing i want to mention is that punishment is an adverse action in esscence, which can inveitable to prduce negative emotion to the children."	I_S0
"in fact, punishment is more like a tutorial sometimes to teach the tip to childrens."	I_S0
"so it cannot be diffcult to be imaged that the bulying in school would happen if adoulecents were harsh punished without edcating how to do right and without being given cares and love."	I_S0
"overall, harsh punishemnt does not work in most of the time."	I_S0
"it is much more significanted to teach children to love and be care  to others  before the discpline is done."	E_S0
 
"As we know,most of time in a person's life is spent on the work."	S_I0
"It seems that people can not live without a job."	S_T0
"And it is a real question how people to organize their schedule."	B_T1
"Some may argue that doing similar tasks all day long is better,while others way think having different types of tasks to do is more satisfying."	E_T1
"In my opinion,I agree with the latter."	S_T0
"Here are some reasons."	S_S2
"Firstly,for workers themselves,doing such varias jobs is one of the best way to avoid becoming tired."	S_M1
"People always easily get bored of something after they keep doing it for a long sequent time without any break or chage,even though they pretty love such things."	B_S0
"Children always fall crazy when they first get their new toys,but after a while,those articles can only be seen in a box,seldom being touched again."	I_S0
"So changing seems essential  to workers whiling doing their job."	E_S0
"What's more ,for managers and boss in the company,it can benefit them when people have different types to do because this way can make the sufficient of workers."	S_M1
"Some people never feel dull while facing different tasks,making them more energetic and desire to finish more."	B_S1
"For example ,in such a situation,I usually think that work will change and desire to do more,always having lots of power."	E_S1
"By the way,although similar tasks means a relatively easier arragement for job,I don't think it is a good a idea."	B_C0
"Imagine a situatuion where lots of workers do the same tasks again and again,seeming having little energy and working like a machine,shouting for a break in their mind."	I_C0
"It is not a good result people want to get."	E_C0
 
"As the result of accelerating of urbanization, transportation is becoming increasingly significant to the development of the city."	B_T1
"There is a debate as to whether the government should make heavy investment in constructing new intercity railways."	E_T1
"From my perspective, what type of traffic to improve should be depend on the level of countries."	B_S0
"A majority of people believe that spending a large amount of money on building new railways is essential."	I_S0
"By constructing sufficient trains between city, time coud be saved, since the citizens do not have to transfer for several times to reach their destinations."	I_S0
"It is easily for them to visit neighbour cities, which would attract more visitors to come and visit."	I_S0
"Conversely, the local tourism would be improved in the long run."	I_S0
"The local economy would also be developed."	I_S0
"If new railway lines which makes the connection with outside world both efficient and convenient are built."	I_S0
"Some entrepreneurs tend to set up companies in these cities, and more workforces would probably come to find a decent job."	I_S0
"However, other individuals hold different views."	I_S0
"The advocates claim that the existing public transportation is the priority that authorities should spend much money."	I_S0
"Compared with constructing a new one, improving the public already have tend to spend lower cost, because the government do not have to build new station and lines."	I_S0
"It is efficient way to help the government to ease financial burdens, so that other fields of countries could develop such as medical system and education."	I_S0
"In addition, investment in public buses and trains will ease traffic congestion."	I_S0
"people are required to reduce their depedence on private cars, because parking a car could be extremely difficult in big citie."	I_S0
"If well-organised transport systems which are comfortable and convenient could be built, people are much more likely to use pubic transportation instead of private vehicles."	I_S0
"In conclusion, it is true that constructing new railways is necessary, but I believe, it is far from enough to promote existing public systems, especially for less developed countries which do not have well-designed rail and road system."	E_S0
 
"Nowadays，people want to study and learn more about history and culture，therefore，more and more people go to the museums."	S_I0
"Some museums are free,but some require people to pay for it."	B_T1
"Personally，I think the disadvantages outweight the advantages."	E_T1
"Initially,   charging will reduce the opportunities of learning for those who cannot afford to pay for admission."	S_M2
"They are eager to learn, however, they lose these chances due to the poverty."	B_S0
"What's more, people are more likely to go to free museums so that they can spend the least money to enjoy more exhibits."	I_S0
"Further more, museums should be open to everyone owing to museums are public cultural resources which are public welfare."	I_S0
"If  it is free, more people can improve their level of education."	E_S0
 
"The bars illustrate how many times (in million) the four types of materials investigated were loaned from a particular library in the UK in 1995, 2000, and 2005."	B_I0
"Overall, the pattern of loan varied slightly between the three years."	E_I0
"Audio-visual materials were lent least frequently, and they were borrowed 20 million to 30 million times a year."	S_M1

"Fictional books for adults had varying popularity between the three years."	S_M1
"The year of 1995, in which the books were borrowed over 300 million times, saw the highest popularity."	B_S1
"In 2000, those books, having had decreased popularity, were borrowed as many times as adult non-fiction books, and in 2005, they had even lower popularity and were borrowed for the same number of times as that of children’s books."	E_S1

"Countries require smokers to pay high taxes on purchasing cigarettes and unhealthy foods."	B_I0
"In the reading passage, it reckons this policy creates social benefits, however, the listening contradicts it in the following points."	E_I0
"Firstly, the reading stands on the taxes encourage people to live in healthy behaviors as the increase in taxes on cigarettes leads smokers to buy fewer, so people are able to be healthier."	S_M1
"Same as purchasing junk foods, raising taxes will reduce obesity rates."	B_S0
"But the lecturer supposes it is unnecessary."	I_S0
"Although the taxes increase, some people might buy cheap and low-quality products that contain even more harmful substances, thus bring more risks to one's health."	I_S0
"It also retorts junk foods consumers probably continue to buy those even the taxes are expensive."	E_S0
"Later on in the passage, taxes are suggested to be financially fair since people can get sick when they smoking or eating unhealthy products, which makes them produce medical costs."	S_M1
"Nonetheless, it seems unjust for everyone in society as there are people who stay healthy, they might pay equally."	B_S0
"At the same time, the reading points out it creates extra income for covering medical costs."	I_S0
"And in this way, some financial burden can be shifted from all society to participants from unhealthy activities."	I_S0
"There is one thing in common that the listening agrees is: people who indulging in unhealthy behaviors should pay their consequences."	I_S0
"But it disagrees that reducing society burdens because these additional costs don't account for incomes."	I_S0
"Compared high-income earners with low-income earners, the later may pay expensive taxes to their incomes, but the former may not."	I_S0
"It not only doesn't reduce burdens but also generates greater burdens to low-income communities."	E_S0
"In the end, the high taxes on cigarettes essentially increases revenue for the government, which means the government is able to utilize the revenue to establish more public welfare, for instance, building stadiums, creating public parks, or supporting public education."	B_C0
"Hence, this is regarded as benefits for everyone."	I_C0
"On the contrary, the lecture identifies a downside that the government might relay on these millions of incomes and they don't want to lose money."	I_C0
"So they won't continue to be forceful on policies or implement laws, even ban smoking, only because the government chooses to not losing incomes."	E_C0
 
"I agree with this statement."	O
"It is common to cause serious social problem when speaking foreign language ."	S_M0
"One who isn't a native speaker means u have to spend many years to learn native idioms and local  manners."	B_S1
"Even some native speak can not avoid speaking mistakes,much less the foreign speaker."	E_S1
"The practical problems, in my opinion, usually negatively affect an individual’s life and development in a foreign land."	S_M0
"The reason why social problems caused."	B_S0
"if  a foreign people wants to express or ask something but in a wrong way ,the native speaker you talked to might misunderstand what you mean."	I_S0
"They might feel impatience and even feel offended."	E_S0
"Also ,religion is an important part of foreign language."	S_M0
"In different countries ,many people believe in different type of religion,this means you should focus and pay attention to whether you words has violated them."	S_S2
"Nevertheless, living in a foreign country where it’s necessary to speak the local language presents its advantages too, such as being immersed in the linguistic environment to learn the language more efficiently."	S_M0
"Besides, people could be more driven to reflect on their own cultures and identities when living in another nation."	B_S1
"But the impacts of language barrier and cultural shock on individuals are not to be overlooked."	E_S1
"To conclude, the social and practical problems are inevitable when people live a foreign nation and have to speak the local tongue."	B_C1
"However, one should always respect the local culture, learn the language and be actively involved in the social interactions to have a more rewarding life experience."	E_C1

"After entering the cyber era, it is common to share information in every aspect interpersonally and internationally."	S_I0
"Some hold the view that it is extremely good to share information while others cannot agree with it."	B_T0
"From my perspective, it is apparently beneficial but some information should not be shared freely."	E_T0
"Indeed, information sharing in scientific research, business and academic world is clearly helpful to achieve development of every country."	S_M1
"For one, it does provide considerable opportunities to boost international and local economy by summits and forums."	B_S0
"Summer Davos Forum is a good case that all the participants could exchange information to get inspired, which extremely contributes to the global economic progress."	I_S0
"For another, some medical events need huge information from every country to overcome, especially in some less developed regions such as Africa and Asia."	E_S0
"Unfortunately, sharing valuable information is not always beneficial to every country."	S_M1
"First and foremost, some advanced technology is time-consuming, and it is unfair for the inventors to share the key information to the public."	B_S0
"As writers would never give up their copyrights without being paid, at least scientists should not offer the information freely."	I_S0
"Besides, some information especially related to military secret or commercial secret should be protected carefully, otherwise it would become a terrible trouble when governments need to fight with social evils or terrorists thanks to information sharing."	I_S0
"To some extent, it is not wise to spread the information all over the world."	E_S0

"I disagree with the view that primary traffic and environmental problems will be eased if only increasing the price of petrol."	B_T1
"There are some points and reasons of mine."	E_T1
"First of all, although petrol cars are the main cause of environmental pollution, the technology of new energy vehicles is not mature and can not replace the position of petrol cars."	S_M1
"In addition, cars are an indispensable means of transportation for most families, and increasing the price of petrol will bring more living costs to these families."	B_S1
"Generally, the transportation of commodities on the market is largely dependent on petrol vehicles, so the increase of petrol prices will also lead to the increase of commodity prices and thus affect the quality of people's lifes."	E_S1
"In order to solve the problems of traffic congestion and environmental pollution, in my opinion, there are better solutions."	S_M1
"For the former, we can greatly develop public transport systems and ride-sharing systems."	B_S0
"In other words, if people can easily replace petrol cars with other ways of transportation, traffic congestion will be reduced."	I_S0
"With regard to the latter, the government can increase the development of new energy vehicles and give greater incentives to new energy vehicle buyers."	I_S0
"Only when new energy vehicles develop to a certain degree will they be accepted by more people."	E_S0
"All in all, it is difficult to solve transportation and environmental problems simply by increasing the price of gasoline."	B_C1

"Whether museums need to charge or not has seemed an open debate."	E_I0
"In my view,although there are some positive aspects of charging people for admission to museums,i tend to say that the disadvantages are outweigh the advantages."	S_T1
"On the one hand,it is true that there are some positive influence of charging people for admission to museums exist."	S_M1
"Firstly,museums can use admission fees to develop facilities of museums."	B_S0
"For example,it is inevitable that museums need money to pay for some staff who can manage all things and also,many facilities should be updated if they are damaged."	I_S0
"Secondly,If museums charge admission fees,there are not many unrelated personnel who do not interested in museums but only want to have a seat in there."	I_S0
"It enables museums to provide a quiet environment to let people who are fond of museums enjoy."	E_S0
"On the other hand,the negative influence are more than advantages."	S_M1
"Firstly,if museums charge people for admission fees,it will lead to the emergence of some museums with open fees but low quality."	B_S0
"Secondly,it is unnecessary to charge people for admission fees because museums can gain money from selling some souvenirs."	I_S0

"It can hardly be denied that the exquisite metal towers reaching into the sky and the not so stunning yet ridiculously massive post-modern builings are two of the main features when talkig about geothermal eneygy plants, yet the even more majestic sturctures of the plants are buried underneath the ground as a matter of fact."

"Nowadays,due to the higher demand of people towards the quality of life,there has been a lot of controversy about which is more effective to improve public health,constructing more sports facilities or having other methods like setting up more training lessons about keeping fit?"	S_I0
"From my perspective,we need to combine them with each other and both are required to improve public health."	S_T0
"As a fundamental aspect of suggesting more people developing a habit of taking exercise,completing the sports facilities is a must for government to deal with."	S_M1
"With more and more parks equipped with these facilities,it surely provides a more convenient way for children and adults to refresh their exhaustion by taking more daily exercise wherever they want."	B_S0

"Meanwile, in the way to the sucess, they could encounter the limited difficulty, which is likely to be solve easily."	I_S0
"So they believe they are able to succeed, leading to the full passion."	I_S0
"By contrast, if the goals are ambitious, they always seems to suspect their own ability, and at last they possibly choose to give up."	I_S0
"For example, the person works in a urban city, and he are able to earn one thousand a month."	I_S0
"If his goal is to buy a iphone, he could save money from the daily expense, such as the foods, the clothes and the transportation, so he believe that he could buy this cellphone only if he resist for a period of time."	I_S0
"At last, he spend just half year in finishing this goals."	E_S0

"In contemporary societies, studying seems to mean only learning in schools for a great number of people, which brings about a series of negative thoughts on studying when young teenagers are leaving school."	S_T1
"As far as I am concerned, this phenomenon usually results from three causes."	B_S0

"It is because the media is truly the main way of people getting all kinds of information, ranging from current affairs to entertainments news."	B_S1
"This means that the media does influences the public’s views and attitudes to a great extent."	E_S1
"On the other hand, it is not unchangeable for both government and the public facing this situation."	S_M1

"In my opinion,I shall explain why I think that it is a good idea for secondary school students to do compulsory community service."	I_I0

"What's the most important,children grow up just when they make mistakes and then correct it ."	I_S0
"The process is very crucial for their growth."	I_S0
"No matter how parents want to help their children, they need their free time to sovle all the problems they cause."	I_S0

"I think the proposal of making laws to make people recycle more is totally unnecessary."	B_I0
"First, there is nothing wrong with the starting point of the proposal."	I_I0
"The recycling of garbage accords with the theme of protecting the ecological environment and the need for sustainable development."	I_I0
"However, the status of recycling is still too low compared to other events."	I_I0
"Such as industrial emissions, global vegetation reduction, nuclear pollution, light pollution and so on."	E_I0
"Compared with these "big events", recycling clearly does not rise to the level of importance that requires legislation."	S_T0
"He should be placed in the category of suggestion, method, or regulation."	S_T1
"Secondly, it is impossible to make laws in a day."	S_M1
"It requires calculation, design, deliberation and even regional experiments."	B_S0
"The first step in recycling is proper sorting, which happens to be done in some parts of China."	I_S0
"But frankly speaking, from my personal point of view, the effect of this experiment is not ideal."	I_S0
"First, the public's response has been negative."	I_S0
"Second, people do not feel the substantial changes that waste sorting has brought to their lives."	I_S0
"Perhaps the only change is that life has become more boring and troublesome."	I_S0
"Good recycling suffers such a setback in the first step, but how much will it take to achieve it fully, nationally and globally?"	E_S0
"And so came the third, the budget."	S_M1
"Making laws means that they must be fully enforced."	B_S0
"There is no doubt that good recycling requires a lot of money, material resources and manpower."	I_S0
"So do we pay in direct proportion to our returns?"	I_S0
"In short, how much benefit will this bring us?"	I_S0
"Some would say that protecting the environment is priceless, but reality often forces us to make choices."	E_S0
"My view is that we need education to fundamentally change the minds of the next generation."	B_C0

"When it comes to the issue about how to relax oneself when you feel tired,people's opinion differs from person to person."	S_T0

"As far as I am concerned,both of the two methods are to be emphasized."	B_T0
"In my opinion,doing physical exercise is no less important than watching a movie or reading a book."	E_T0
"Primarily,working out after a long period of struggling can make people refreshed,and then people could come back to their work or study with a fresher thought and a clearer mind,which could definitly improve their working or learning efficiency."	S_M1

"Suppose you have been buried in a series of grueling work and stayed up late for a whole week,it could be a impossible task for you to take exercise."	I_S0
"Under this circumstance,have a glimpse of a interesting story or just watching a romantic film would provide you a better sense of relaxing."	E_S0
"In conclusion,there should be no prejudice against either of these two basic ways to relax onself."	B_C0

"And the goverment make laws for it is necessary."	E_I0
"Here are aome of my points."	S_M1
"Firstly, the recycle system of the waste from homes should be improved."	B_S0
"In china, the waste classifiction in home is not full start."	I_S0
"Not like Japan, different kinds of waste are recycled every day in every week."	I_S0
"And there is another problem that the news reported."	I_S0
"Although the classification of waste is start in some big citis,different waste is collected to one place which make the classification no means."	I_S0
"So the goverment needs to make laws for the detail of recycle system."	E_S0
"Secondly,the goverment should make laws for fining people who don't claasify the waste  or droping waste everywhere."	S_M1
"and thirdly,there some measures don't need the laws."	B_S0
"the goverment should promote to people for the importance of the recycle of waste from homes."	I_S0
"And the goverment should promote it in the metro station , TV, the internet and so on."	E_S0
"In conclusion, some measures must need to make laws to request people,but other measures could be more obvious and effective which don't need to make laws."	S_C2
 
"There is no doubt that the improved medical care have contributed to the increasing life expectancy."	S_T0
"It is controversial whether the advantages of the development overweigh the disadvantages."	S_T1

"Admittedly, the longer life expectancy means the senior citizens is more likely to live with their adult children, bringing them joy and happiness and improving their life quality."	S_M1
"They have opportunities to teach their grandchildren good family history and values."	B_S0
"Moreover, for parents, with the elderly parents helping them take care of children, they have more time and energy as well as ambition to develop career."	I_S0
"Retiring later due to the rising lifetime can promote age diversity in the workplace."	E_S0
"However, I cannot agree with the viewpoint above."	S_M1
"The first reason why claim so is that the growth of population leads to the increasing the burden on the planet, which create more and more pollution."	B_S0
"There are going to greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, contribute to the global warming and climate change."	I_S0
"On the other hand, one of the negative impact is accelerating resource shortage and putting great pressure on natural resource."	I_S0
"For example, in Africa, where the water and crops are lacking, the shortage will become worse if there are more and more people."	I_S0
"Moreover, for a family, too many people causes rising living costs, increasing the burden on the family."	E_S0

"Concerning the statement that helping friends by oneself is more banificial than finding a tutor, I certainly agree."	S_T1

"Human are social animals, which means that affinity plays an important roles in our lives."	B_S0
"So when helping your friends in study, you are actually consolidate your friendship."	I_S0
"The best exmaple that appears in my mind is my classmate in junior high, Alex."	I_S0
"He didn't have many interests."	I_S0
"Because of that, he often can not join our conversation."	I_S0
"Instead of doing the things that he did not interested at all, he start a lot of conversations about the courses."	I_S0
"As a result, he did not have to suffer from loneliness for most of the time."	E_S0
"Another idea I have for siding with the opening statement involves efficiency."	S_M1
"Obviously, you have a better understanding of your friend than a tutor."	B_S0
"The teaching process will be much more easier because of it."	I_S0
"Growing from a big city in China, under the competitive enironment, I have taught by many tutors, and not everyone of them can makes me benefit a lot."	I_S0
"Moreover, with the growth of the education industry, more and more tutor are avilable now a days, which makes the selcting process even harder, let alone efficiency."	E_S0
"In conclusion, asffinity and efficiency are what I believe to be important points for supporting the aforementioned statement."	B_C1
"I feel these are solid arguments which support my opinion that success comes with risk taking and exploring new activities."	E_C1

"In the set of material, the reading passage declaims that the genetically modified trees will provide great benefits, whereas, the listening passage thinks they are not as great as it first sound."	S_I0
"Firstly, it is said in the passage that genetically modified trees have better survival abilities than normal trees."	S_M1
"However, the lecture suggests the opposite."	B_S0
"The speaker says that when meeting with some environmental challenge, normal trees may die individually without influencing other trees."	I_S0
"While all of the genetically modified trees may  die synchronously at that condition."	I_S0
"So actually these kind of trees don't survive better than normal trees."	E_S0
"Secondly, the lecture indicates that genetically modified trees will cost more than normal trees."	S_M1
"Since the farmer should pay the loan and give money to the company everytime they plant, so it actually cost more than planting normal trees."	B_S1
"And that also refutes the opinion of the passage."	E_S1
"Thirdly, the lecture states that the genetically modified trees will cause more damage to the native trees."	B_C1
"Most of genetically modified trees plant among the normal trees, and they will share the nutritients with the native trees around them, which, in the long run, may crowd out the natural trees."	E_C1
"It is also opposite to the declaim of the passage that these kind of trees can help to protect wild trees from overexploitation."	S_S2

"There is a heated discussion on who is more affected by celebrities such as athletes and well-known entertainers, younger people or older people?"	E_I0
"From my perspective, celebrities will influence more on younger people."	S_T0
"First of all, younger people are more familiar with atheletes and entertainers."	S_M1
"They know their stories and are certain to be affected."	B_S0
"On the contrary, most older people do not have interest in celebrities, for most of them have no access to get to know celebrities."	I_S0
"There are no television or network when they grew up."	E_S0
"Second, many celebrities are very young, as a result of which, older people may not want to be influenced for they experience more and have a deeper understanding about life."	S_M1
"However, younger people have less eperience and eager to digest celebrities' opinion in order to make more wise decision in the future."	B_S1
"So younger people are more will to listen to celebrities."	E_S1
"Last but not least, even there are networks around the world, most older people do not know how to use the phone and get in touch with the internet."	S_C2
"Therefore, they may not even know what celebrities say although they know who they are."	B_S0
"Most younger people today use internet and read news everyday."	I_S0
"They know what is going on around the world and the words said by celebrities."	E_S0
 
"Many people think that family plays the first role in children's lives."	S_I0
"The others think the opposite way, they think there exist influences outside from home, and those influences play a bigger part for their development."	S_T1
"In my personal perspective, I think both illustrations show some part of true fact, but neither of them reveals the true whole fact."	B_T0
"I think in most cases, family influences kids most, but still, we can not neglect the fact the influences outside might also have some impact on children."	E_T0
"Some people throw out an idea that the kids are deeply influenced by their early age experiences and this is the most influentail factor."	S_M0
"And when a baby is born, he is most likely to stay with his parents and families, and he is potentially immate the behaviors of his parents."	B_S0
"This shows how the kids is influenced by his family."	I_S0
"In my opinion, parents are often the first teacher who helps the kids build up their own personalities and foster their world views."	I_S0
"And in this process, kids are shaped to become the kind of person they tend to become in the future."	E_S0
"But there might be some other cases."	S_M0
"If the families neglect the kids and rarely stay with the babies, the children may stay a longer time with the babysitters, the neighbors, their school teachers and their friends."	B_S0
"Then in this case, without the involvement of the family, influences outside plays a bigger role in one's development."	I_S0
"What's more, many people believe that the children can be reshaped through education after they grow up."	E_S0
"Despite those facts that families may seem not to play a powerful influence, they still do have a deep influence."	S_M0
"The kids who are neglected by his family often react differently comparing to those kids who are carefully looked after by their families."	B_S1
"And this is also the evidence of family influence on children's life."	E_S1
"In conclusion, I think kids are tend to be influenced by their families most."	B_C1
"Though the influence outside from home still exists"	E_C1

"first of all,we should confirm the reason why the students have a negative thoughts."	I_S0
"In my opinion, there is some factors may lead that."	I_S0
"First, what have the students learned in the school didn't make the students feel satisefy."	I_S0
"Second, students may not be insterested in they study which are their parents' insterest."	I_S0
"Third, as the society become much more realism, What do the students really want is a skill but not a simple knowledge."	I_S0
"These three factor may be the cause of this strange phenomenon."	I_S0
"So, according to thoes factor we have seen at last paragragh."	I_S0
"We might have a clear thought about this matter."	I_S0
"what should we  do is progress our educaion acordding to those factors."	I_S0
"firstly, we should increase our lessons."	I_S0
"The more course which students can choose by themself, the more satisefy will the students feel."	I_S0
"secondly, we should respect students own interests."	I_S0
"Once, student having interest in their study, there would be no more negative attitude anylonger."	I_S0
"Just like the old saying'the interest is the best teacher'."	I_S0
"Lastly, shool should provide much more efficient course to student."	I_S0

"After doing physical exercise,people wil be stronger and healthier,which is the best result of relaxing."	I_S0
"Oppositely,watching a movie or reading a book is a easier way to be relax,which is  simple."	I_S0
"Although you can also be relax in wacthing or reading,but i think it is temporary and it means that after a short time ,you will be less relaxed in the end."	I_S0
"Therefore,doing physical exercise can last for a longer time."	I_S0

"What factors lead to this present situation ?"	I_I0
"And what bad impacts it may bring to human?"	E_I0
"From my own point of view,the following reasons should be taken into considerations."	S_T0

"Only if they know the inportent of study can they study out of their  heart."	I_S0
"Study makes us better."	I_S0

"Since having a good job seems to be such an important part of our life, the question of whether it is better for children to choose jobs that are similar to ther parents' jobs than to choose different jobs are something that we discussed over and over again through our whole life."	B_T0
"Even though this is something that I do not really think that worth our effort to argue about, since everybody has their own characteristics and interests, it is not up to us to decide what it good for them."	I_T0
"Personally speaking, I do think it is better for children to choose jobs that are similar to their parents' jobs."	I_T0
"There are just so much beneficials if they choose to do the same jobs, and the reasons are as follows."	E_T0
"Firstly, most children growing up with their parents will inevitablly influced by their parents' career."	S_M1
"What their parents been talking during the dinner time, what they have been reading will all have an impact on thh children."	B_S0
"The children will have a sense of idea of what their parents are doing, and it is likely for the children to grow an interest on the similar subjects since the children are hearing or looking at it all day."	I_S0
"Studying all those "second- hand" related information while growing up is a marvelous preperation for the children before they enter the college to study those subjects."	I_S0
"Taking myself as an example, my father is an archaeologist focusing on the ancient Asian Art."	I_S0
"He can talk about the ancient bronzes all day nonestop, and my family have a giant collection of archaeological books."	I_S0
"I grew up reading those books talking about ancient pieces of art, and I developed a deep interest in Art History."	I_S0
"Eventually I choose to study Art History as my major during my college, and with the information my dad had taught me before hand, I do feel myself is better prepared for college academic life."	I_S0
"So choosing a job that is similar to parents' job can help children to develop an early interest and prepare themselves for the higher-level study,"	E_S0
"What I have been discussed about earlier is before the children entering the "Adult World" of finding jobs, and the second reason why it is beneficial for children to choose a job that similar to their parents' is that the parents can provide the children more resources and suggestions."	S_M1
"I think most parents want to provide their children the best thing they have, and  things that are really important during work are resources and experiences."	B_S0
"Choosing a similar job means, the children is entering a world that is very familar to the parents, they parents can provide so many priceless suggestions about how to do well in certain place since the parents themselves have so many experience already."	I_S0
"Since the parents have already worked for so long, they also have their own social networking that was build while working."	I_S0
"As we all know, social networing is essential when we are working, and have a strong and free networing that is provided by the parents are just marvelous."	I_S0
"If the children choose a job that is totally different from their parents, those are the benefits that they cannot really enjoy."	E_S0
"Overall, I definitely think it is better for children to choose jobs that are similar to their parents' jobs, because the parents can provide a lot."	S_C2
 
"Nowadays,some people argued that whether sports facilities are definitely important for us to improve public health."	B_T1
"Someone think increasing the number of sports facilities are needed."	I_T1
"However,others don't think it's helpful for us."	E_T1
"In many countries around the world,sports facilities are diminishing at a high speed."	S_M2
"Therefore,less people would exercise in the outside."	B_S1
"I"	E_S1
 
"From my point,even though family is important to children,the affect outside from home has a large impacton children's development in their life."	B_S0
"In one side,family has a crucial impact in the childhood."	I_S0
"One reason is it will influence children's growth,we all know that children have a strong ability to imitate and plasticity,an act you don't expect will leave a deep impression in their mind,which will make an important impact in their life."	I_S0
"What kind of person a child becomes largely depends on what kind of family environment he grows up in."	I_S0
"In the other hand,the family will affect physical and mental development."	I_S0
"For example,in a home filled with cold and violence,children grow up to be timid or traitorous."	E_S0
"In other words,outside from home are also necessary,this is related to whether the child will be positive and have their own goals in the future."	S_M2
"For instance,the child in the vocational school have no vision for their future because the people they come into contact with are unmotivated."	B_S1
"ByMeanwhile,the lure of the outside world can exercise self-control,there are many attractive things but wrong,only when child resist these temptations can they firmly be themselves."	E_S1
 
"I agree with this opinion."	S_T0
"Because I think the education of 5 to 10 years old children is the most important stage of education."	S_T1
"When they go to the primary school,that means they need to learn how to be a people who always with their ready smile and good mind."	B_S0
"We must need to leave something good in their heart."	I_S0
"And these things we can only give them in this stage of year."	I_S0
"And be a good guy is the most important thing in your life,it's the basis of social harmony."	I_S0
"And if you miss this chance when they enter adolescence ."	I_S0
"It's scarcely possible to tell them."	I_S0
"Because they had their own opinion."	I_S0
"And the education of 5 to 10 can make their opinion positively,and make them avoid detours in their life."	I_S0
"So when they join society ,they can from complex interpersonal relationship to find the real friend and also find the key to the success."	I_S0
"And another reason of 5 to 10 education is the most important is that the habits needs to developing in this stage of life."	I_S0
"When you are in primary school you into the real life of learning."	I_S0
"And it is the started,so it is the best time to developing the habits."	I_S0
"When you have many good habits."	I_S0
"you will ease the the life of learning."	I_S0
"and in society."	I_S0
"It can also make you make choice correctly."	I_S0
"It is also important in your life."	I_S0
"And in others time you can't find the chance like this."	I_S0
"So you can know why we should spend more money on five to ten years old children."	I_S0
"and in university,you can't find the good chance like this to make the basis of your life,you need to study very hard."	I_S0
"So make these things in this stage of your life is the best choice."	I_S0
"so I agree"	E_S0
 
"I think the goverments should spend more money on building railways."	S_T1
"First of all, our country's roads are repaired perfect,so we need to spend money on things that aren't perfect."	B_S0
"Secondly, as we now advocate green travel,low carbon and environmental protection,most people choose to travel by public transport."	I_S0
"So we should improve the subway to make it more convenient for more people to gou out."	I_S0
"On the other hand, if the subway is more convenient, more people will choose public transportation and the environment will be further protected."	I_S0
"Thirdly, compared with cars, subway can save us more time without traffic jams."	I_S0
"For people in a hurry, the subway is a better choice than the car."	I_S0
"Fourth, the price of taking subway is also very cheap."	I_S0
"For people who have no money to buy a car, subway is the bes choice to save time and mony."	I_S0
"Taking myself as an exmple, where I went to college, the traffic was very heavy, and it cost a lot of money and time to take a taxi from the school, so we would choose the subway to go out to play."	I_S0
"Since most of the floating people in a city are young people, saving time and money is the first choice."	I_S0
"Compred with building roads, the improvement of subway is more liked by the young people."	E_S0
"These are my opions, consdering the floating people and the time, subway is more convenient than cars."	S_M2
"So I think the goverments should spend more money on building railways."	S_S2

"Oppositely, the pipeline was the lowest at 5 million tonnes appr oximately."	I_S0
"The quantities of goods transported by rail fluctuated over this period, reaching the lowest poin in 1995 at 23 million toonnes before sifht risen back to the former figure."	I_S0

"The reading passage explores the issue that the 'let it burn' policy cause severe consequence,  and the professor's lecture deals with the same issue."	B_I0
"However, ."	E_I0
"she thinks that this policy is a good one for Yellowstone, she uses 3 specific points to support her idea."	S_T1
"Firstly, even though the reading passage claims that fire caused huge damage tothe vegetation and trees  in Yellowstone, the professor argues in the lecture that the fire is beneficial to the vegetation and plants."	S_M1
"This is because some new plants growed in the park and the diversity of vegetation increased a lot because of the fire."	S_S2
"However, contrary to the statement in the reading that the animals were affected and the habitats and food chain in the park were damaged buy the fire, the professor contends that the population has already recoverd."	S_M1
"Then he supports this point with the fact that some small animals like rabbits and their predators began to live there after the fire."	S_S2
"Finally, the author of the reading claims that the policy has taken serious effect to the local economy and the reduced the number of tourists."	B_C1
"The professor proves that this claim is indefensible bu pointing out that the unusual fire occurs ocassionnaly and the tourists will come back next year and each year after that."	E_C1
 
"In the reading, the article comes up with an assumption that sending people to an asteroid would be the best colonization option and lists out three reasons to support this statement."	S_T1
"However, in the listening, tha professor questions the feasibility of this plan and offers his own perspective on the issue."	B_S0
"First, the reading states that the low-gravity environment on asteroids makes it convenient for people to colonize there."	I_S0
"However, in the listening, the professor presents certain risks of low-gravity environments and points out the problem is not that simple."	I_S0
"People who live in a low-gravity environment would suffer from muscle loss and lower bone density."	I_S0
"Even those astronauts who just spend a short period of time in spaceship would also have muscle and bone density loss, not to mention stay in a low-environment asteroid for longer periods."	I_S0
"Second, the reading claims that the abudant resources on asteroids, such as gold and platinum, would make tha prospect of the colonization very profitable and is worth colonizing."	I_S0
"However, in the listening, tha professor also points out one potential problem in it."	I_S0
"The costs of mining and trasporting these materials back to earth would be so high that the profit could be quiet minimal."	I_S0
"Also, if these raw materials are excavated in large quantities, the price of them is likely to be low in the market because there are too many of them."	I_S0
"In this case, tha whole business is not lucrative"	E_S0
 
"Nowadays, it has been a hot issues that no matter who controls the media will controls opinion and attitudes of the people and it is hard for people to retify this phenomena."	S_T1
"In my opinion, I disagree with tis idea."	S_T0
"Admittedly,the media has a significant influence on people."	S_M1
"Becuase comparing with books ,people are more attached to medias, espacially the social media that everyone express their ideas online."	B_S0
"They are more likely to be affected by those media's opinions and attitudes, espacially for people without any distinguish ability."	I_S0
"But that not means the media can control everyone and there are still serveral methods to relieve this problem."	E_S0
"First,the government should introduce policies and regulations that restrict the media express the wrong ideas, which would have a serious effect on people ."	S_M1
"Different oppions online should be encouraged."	B_S0
"When different oppions come out, it will lead to communication and argument."	I_S0
"After that, people's oppions can become clear,which helps people gain greater thinking power to defend the control of the media."	I_S0
"People will not be affected easily by the people who controls the media ."	E_S0
"To summary, media abosultely affect people's opinion and attitudes to some degree."	S_C2

"With the advancement of technology, scientists are constantly seeking opportunities to push back the boundaries of human knowledge, and tourists want to broaden their horizons."	B_T1
"Expeditions to the South Pole and other remote areas just serve these causes."	E_T1
"In my opinion, this development has advantages that outweigh the disadvantages."	B_S0
"It's human's inborn nature to explore the unknown."	I_S0
"the remote natural environments harbor countless surprises in the mysterious sceneries and weird creatures, which will lift everyone's spirit."	I_S0
"As for ordinary tourists, they eager for opportunities to immerse in a completely different environment and have an unforgettable experience."	I_S0
"On the scientists' part , they may shoulder the responsibility of expanding the scope of knowledge and have the necessity to visit those remote places, which may produce outcomes that will benefit generations of people."	I_S0
"Besides, there are abundant natrual resources in those remote areas, for example, rare herbs and other plantations."	I_S0
"Medicine producers may cure some previously incurable diseases by utilizing these resources."	I_S0
"Admittedly, human activities in those areas will pose a threat to local environments."	I_S0
"Based on our living experiences, it's easy for us to vision beautiful natural resorts strewed with litters or damaged by commercial exploitation, which is greatly disappointing for nature-loving people."	I_S0
"This, is inevitably a side effect of human access to those wonderful places."	I_S0
"With all those unsettling possibilities, I firmly believe we can minimize the adverse effect by setting regulations, fining tourists who litter and restricting profit-motivated exploitations."	I_S0
"To conclude, the rapid increase of human exploration in remote areas is an irreversible trend, since the advantages are too significant."	I_S0
"But at the same time, we must take the disadvantages into consideration, and try to keep human activities under control."	E_S0
 
"Nowadays,health is playing a significant role and exerting great impact on our daily life."	S_T1
"Some suggest that the best sollution in improving public health is to increase sports facilities."	B_S0
"Some others hold a quite different view."	I_S0
"They think the public should take other measures to keep themselves healthy."	I_S0
"In my view,building more sports facilities is of great value to public health,but it's far less than enough."	I_S0
"Firstly,despite the great development of economy in the 21st century, the gap between the wealthy and poor areas is actually becoming larger than before."	I_S0
"On one hand,there is still a lack of sports facilities in small towns and some rural areas which should be paid much attention to by the governments."	I_S0
"It's still quite necessary for them to cost a great deal of money in changing this situation."	I_S0
"On the other hand,the governments have already built too many sports facilities to satisfy people's exercising needs in those core cities."	I_S0
"It's strongly suggested to reduce relevant expenditures in those areas in case of a waste of public resources."	I_S0
"Secondly,people should also take other actions."	I_S0
"for example, we can also do some regular physical exercises like jogging and going hiking ."	I_S0
"If possible,we can join some fitting clubs which will organise some outdoor activities."	I_S0

"In my opinion, I would like to work five days a week ."	E_I0
"I will give three specific exmaples."	S_T1
"Firstly."	S_M0
"I can more efficence work in a long term."	B_S0
"If I work three days a week, I might feel very stressful."	I_S0
"I can not work and remenber too many a day, then, my effitient will become lower."	I_S0
"But, if  I work five days a week, I can have enough time to clean all the stuff I did, I can get normal rest time, my life is more rules."	E_S0
"In additional."	S_M0
"Working five days a week I will not easy forget what Iearn in this week."	B_S0
"I remenber when I was in an chinese festival, I only need to work three days a week."	I_S0
"During the holidays was very happy."	I_S0
"But after the holidays, I forgot what I learned before."	I_S0
"I wasted more time too review."	E_S0
"Last but not least."	S_M0
"If I work three days a week, I might easy do not want to study after that."	B_S0
"When I was in middle school, there were too clold outside, so , the school decided to give us two days holidays."	I_S0
"And these two days connect with weekend, so I just play on video games at home."	I_S0
"When I come back to school, I always thought about video games, during that month, I failed many classes."	I_S0
"To put in a netshell."	I_S0
"I prefer to work five days a week for short hours."	I_S0
"I can work more efficence during five days."	I_S0
"I will not easy foget what I learn before."	E_S0
"And I will more concentrate on my works, do not distracted by video games."	S_C2
 
"In the reading material, the author claims that the answer to how Egyptians managed to move the blocks in place lies in three aspects: ramps, cranes, and concrete."	S_I0
"Firstly, despite the statement in the reading material that ramps were used to move the stones to high levels, the professor contends that there is no evidence for ramps once exsiting in Egypt."	S_M0
"Then she sets an example that if ramps were required to lift in 140 meters, it would fall down."	B_S1
"Besides, Egyptians could not ensure that the ramps lifted were on the right place."	E_S1
"Secondly, the reading material indicates that cranes were used to move stones into high positions."	S_M0
"By contrasst, in accordance with the professor, this claim does not hold water."	B_S0
"It is on the ground that cranes were never built at that time, nor had them been found."	I_S0
"Therefore, it is not plausible that Egyptians used cranes to lift stones."	E_S0
"Finally, the reading material points out that some form of concrete was likely to be used, yet the professor asserts that Egyptians at that time did not have knowledge about how to make concrete."	S_M0
"This is because Roman used concrete first century B.C., which means people try to use concrete after Egyptians."	S_S2
 
"People always travel either in their native country or on abroad."	B_I0
"I believe that you always have seen the lack of a tour guide in other country because the blooming of tourism."	E_I0
"Besides, you can also see the people who have been to other country knows more than others."	S_T0
"How this happen?"	B_T1
"Is it just because that people think travel to other country can offer them more fun?"	E_T1
"I don't think so."	S_T0
"The reason can be like this."	B_S1
"People will benefit more when they travel to foreign countries."	E_S1
"First, this traveling experience can provide them with a great view of some new thing, and this can open their eyes."	S_M1
"For example, as we all know, Ma yun didn't creat his company called Alibaba until he has travelled to America."	B_S0
"Because of what he has seen in Sicolon Valley,  he found the potenial of Internet."	I_S0
"And he thought the Internet will finally change people 's lifestyle and improve the world."	I_S0
"I don't think he can just came up with this great idea if he didn't travel to the US."	I_S0
"It's the travelling experience that played an important role in his creation of the Alibaba."	E_S0
"Secondary, by travelling to foreign country, we will experience different cultures since people in different countries have distinct ways of living."	S_M1
"And then, we can learn some advantages from them."	B_S0
"Take Japan for example, Japan has been invaded by some western countries."	I_S0
"And people in Japan wanted to truly know why the western countries were stronger than Japan."	I_S0
"Then, they realuzed that the mechanism that western uesd to ru their country is more effcicent."	I_S0
"And the culture there are more scientic than theirs."	I_S0
"So they decided to learn form these countruies."	I_S0
"Now you can still find many common points in the culture of western countries and Japan."	I_S0
"And that's why the Japan could become one of the strongest countries in the world quickly."	E_S0
"Last, travelling to another sountry will provide a perfect opportunity for you to learn a foreign lanuage."	B_C0
"For instance, I believe that English is learned by most people in our country."	I_C0
"But many people cannot speak English fluently at present."	I_C0
"And why."	I_C0
"Probably, they lack a native atomsphere to speak English."	I_C0
"And travelling to an English country can offer them this environment which will be greatly helpful to their spoken English."	E_C0
 
"Currently, it prevails in many places that young people are different from they used to be."	B_I0
"Whether young people are more independent today has been an issue of public interest and concern."	E_I0
"As for me, I am firmly convinced that an increasing number of young people can make dicisions themselves."	S_T0
"Firstly, in the past, young people need to depend on their parents to make dicisions because they are lack  of money, ability, and experience."	S_M0
"But now, everything changes very quickly."	B_S0
"Sometimes parents' opinions are not useful anymore."	I_S0
"Take my friend James for example, he used to be a good child, depending onhis parents' words very much."	I_S0
"However, one day, it comes to a special assignment which needs new ideas."	I_S0
"With his parents always tell him to just listen to class and follow his teachers, James can not have any creative thought."	E_S0
"Secondly, parents may not have the ability to help their children to make dicisions."	S_M0
"As I have mentioned above, time is changing."	B_S0
"Today' s young people may have a more broaden horizon than their parents."	I_S0
"Moreover, they can have more knowledge about the world, whatever living skills, monetary skills, or working skills."	I_S0
"For instance, many young people's parents have no idea about electric products and thay don't know how to use these products."	I_S0
"But now it' s elecric time, isn't it?"	E_S0
"Third, is about the community's attitude."	S_M0
"People are widely believed that young people shouldn't depend on their parents too much."	B_S0
"Today's education and environment enourage young people to be independent and do everything by themselves."	I_S0
"I am an example."	I_S0
"Once I always do something after asking my parents, I will be considered to be useless."	E_S0
"To sum up, I believed that today young people are better able to make decisions about their own lives."	S_C2
 
"Nowadays Television programs have become the spice of people's lives."	S_T1
"Some people think more TV channels is better because spectators have more choices."	B_S0
"However other people have view that too many TV channels will leads to many poor quality TV programs."	I_S0
"In my oppion,increasely TV channels could make more spectators that television can make much money."	I_S0
"This is because increasely TV programs was much larger and grew far faster in those easy times."	I_S0
"And people have more opportunity to get new informations about world."	I_S0
"It is good for advertiesers they have more choices to show their ideas."	I_S0
"In other hand,more and more TV programs could make"	E_S0
 
"Many young students are leaving schools with negative thoughts on studying."	S_T0
"There are  a number of reasons for this problem."	B_S0
"Many students feel stressed at school。The teacher puts too many homeworks on them When they study at school。Students have spend all the time to finish homework when they come back to home."	I_S0
"They dont not have much time to relax or paly with other students."	I_S0
"Some students are feel tird and aimless"	E_S0
 
"I think as people grow up, they become more influenced by friends than teachers."	B_T1
"Though it also has individual diffrence, generally speaking, I think people over 18 years old are more influenced by their friends than by their teachers; people whose age is 3-18 may be more influenced by their teachers than by their friends."	E_T1
"As we know, people were born with nothing except their genes."	S_M0
"The new baby know nothing about the world."	B_S0
"After their birth, they began to learn."	I_S0
"Through psychology, we know that people have their ability to learn by their mirrow neuro, whose function is just copy others' behavior."	E_S0
"let's think about when we were young, before kindergarten, did our parents tell us to listen to teacher in kindergarten?"	S_M0
"I think  most of us were told that at that time."	B_S1
"So when we were in kindergartens, we will focus on what teacher said and did and just copied them."	E_S1
"In addition, because of many reason, such as culture, media and many other things."	S_M0
"We always think teacher is elder people, we should respect them and they are great."	B_S1
"That is also why we would learn from teacher but not our friends."	E_S1
"But as people become older, people's brain become more and more complex and specific."	S_M0
"People become their own style of their behavior."	B_S0
"And we know that teacher is just a job, not anything other."	I_S0
"We would hardly to copy teacher's behavior."	I_S0
"What's more, after 18 years old, we would in the university."	I_S0
"In this situation, we would be told to do some research."	I_S0
"We know that research need hypothesis and methods."	I_S0
"What teachers can tell you is just methods, especially past methods."	I_S0
"Our thinking are more relying on our life and experience, which is more influenced by our friends."	E_S0
"So because of these reasons, after 18 years old, we will become more independence and we will have our own life circle."	S_M0
"Main influence to our may come from the circle, in which there are no our teachers."	S_S2
"So I think people are more influenced by their teachers than by their friends when they were young."	B_C1
"But as they grow up until 18 years old, they may be more influenced by their friends than by their teachers."	E_C1
 
"I think it is a good idea."	B_T1
"On the one hand,offer money for children is an encouragement for them which can give them more confident to do better."	I_T1
"if children did not get something after they did well in study,they would be frustrated."	I_T1
"Some money can give children a chance to buy something they want and be confident of themsleves."	E_T1
"they would like to do well next time."	B_S0
"For example,when I was in high school,i did not do well in math."	I_S0
"one afternoon,when my parents konw my math text grade which is very terrible,they did not blame at me,they told me they would give me some money if I could get good grades next time."	I_S0
"From then on,I tried my best to learn math and got good grades in the final exam."	E_S0
"On the other hand,offer money can let children konw that money is hard-earned."	S_M2
"Nowadays,many children live without economic pressure that makes them waste money sometimes."	B_S0
"study hard to earn money is a good way to educate children,so that they will think more before they pay for something expensive."	I_S0
"As for me,to make my math better,I got up very early evryday to memorize the formulas and went to bed very late to do a lot of exercises."	I_S0
"However,when I got good grades in the final exam,I could not wait to tell my parents the good news,they praised me and gave me just ten yuan."	E_S0
"After the experience,I totally konw that"	O

"There are some people who deem that doing charity through charitable organzatins is better, which might seem to make sense at first glance."	S_T0
"I am afraid i can nor approve of this view, for thorough analysis in different cases is needed before any conclusion can be reached."	S_T1
"We can hardly deny that today people are occupied, and that makes them do not have much leisure time to distract their daily schedule."	S_M1
"When they do charity through charitable organizations, they can save much time, which can be used to do other more meaningful things."	B_S0
"Today people are occupied by their works, family, entertainments, they are stress out every day."	I_S0
"Even if they do not take part in the enjoyable experience, they also help the needy."	E_S0
"Reasonable as above analysis is, by no means can we take it for granted that such is the same case for special aspects, and it is irrational for us to extend the validity of aforementioned case into all cases."	S_M1
"Actually, the statement will be far from justifiable when we take into account other situations, under which, it is a wiser choice to doing chariy directly."	S_S2
"It is obvious that helping needy directly can have a enjoyable exprience, and that means it can bring you some topics of conversation."	B_C0
"Naturally, People do not talk about serious things when they first meet with others, and then this good exprience become the best choice starting a conversation and making acquaintance with each others, just beacuse people more willing to make friends with kindness person."	I_C0
"Another point that deserves equal attention is people who directly help needy will be more strong in the live."	I_C0
"When they directly see the needy, they more likely to feel the needy's difficulty."	I_C0
"If so, people will knowing that their daily life is very comfortable and the difficulty in their life is not worth mentioning."	I_C0
"Consequently, when they suffering in the life's difficulty, they can overcome it easily."	E_C0

"In fact, it was the lagest data in the time."	I_S0
"On the contrary, the number of the people who went to Middle East is the least ."	I_S0
"(9.8m)"	E_S0
"Before 2000,the number of people who went to America was still increased slowly, but it was decline in the nest 5 years."	S_M2
"And the number of people who went to Total was still enhenced in the past."	B_S0
"An increasing number of people went for travel to Europe in the 1990-2005 period , the number of the visiter was bigger than other areas except Total."	I_S0
"However, some areas which have less visiters like Middle East as well as Africa,and the number of people was lesser than others."	I_S0
"In 15 past years,the data of people who went to Africa was only rised form 18.2m to 28.7m."	I_S0
"In 2000, the data of visiter in America was similar of Asia and the pacific."	I_S0

"When it comes to relax,different people have different opinions."	S_I0
"Some prefer to relax by watching a movie while others are willing to take physical exercise."	B_T0
"However,what I want to say is that it is the purpose rather than approach that matters."	E_T0
"That is to say,there are certain considerations or factors that everyone takes into account."	B_S1
"What they want is just relax."	E_S1
"First,what peope prefer to depends on their interets,and interets may change according to the reality."	S_M1
"For example,one of books becomes very prevalent because of its construction,idea,and humorous sentences."	B_S0
"In order to catch the popularity,people exactly prefer to reading it to relax."	I_S0
"This is also can be proves when it comes to a popular physical exercise."	E_S0
"Second,people choose different ways due to their spare time."	S_M1
"Think about it,people finish their office-work at about 5:00pm,however, they have many other things to deal with after they are back to home."	B_S0
"They have to have dinner and relax only within 3 hours,do they really matters how they relax?"	I_S0
"I
don't think so."	I_S0
"That means,people have to make a accurate schadule to kill the time to relax,no matter by reading or doing exercise."	I_S0
"The third factor people have to consider is that how much the relax cost."	E_S0

"The reading and listening are both talking about the fact that Robert E. Peary had reach the North pole."	B_I0
"The writer proposes three points to support that Robert E. Peary had reach the North pole ."	E_I0
"However, the listening material believes none of them is convincing, based on the following ideas."	S_T1
"First of all, the passage suggests that the National Geographic Society put together a committee that was instructed to conduct a thorough investigation of Peary's records and equipment,while the professor claims the opposite."	S_M0
"She then supports her idea by saying that the committee was composed of pierce close friends, and the conclusion did not make people convinced."	B_S1
"Therefore, the professor does not believe the first point in the passage."	E_S1
"Besides,the text indicates that, a recent expedition provides support for Peary's claim that he reached the North Pole in only 37 days after setting out from Ellesmere Island off the coast of Greenland and another adventurer called Tom Avery made the same trek in less than 37 days."	S_M0
"On the contrary, the lecturer runs exactly counter to it."	B_S0
"She then bolsters her belief with the fact that a speedy trip was different from periods to give a claims."	I_S0
"Thus, the lecturer does not believe the second point in the passage, either."	E_S0
"Finally, the article maintains that there are photographs taken by Peary that support his claim to have reached the North Pole."	S_M0
"Measuring the shadows in Peary's photographs makes it ."	B_S0
"By contrast, the speaker totally disagrees with it."	I_S0
"She then buttresses her statement with the example that the photo could support the point because  the unclear photos could not calculate the position of the sun."	I_S0
"Hence, the speaker deems the third point is not convincing in the passage as well."	E_S0
 
"Currently, there is a debate between citizens."	S_I0
"Some people claim that people will spend more time with foods."	S_T1
"However, I would like to agree that we will spend less time cooking and preparing foods in twenty years than today."	S_T0
"Here are my reasons in the following."	S_T1
"One reason is that the development of technology is able to decrease our time cooking and preparing."	S_M1
"To be more specific, many kinds of roberts have been invented these days."	B_S0
"In addition, believe cooking robot will be present one day so that we do not need to cook and prepare by ourselves."	I_S0
"The roberts can do all these things instead which means the time we dealing with breakfast, lunch and dinner can be highly decreased."	I_S0
"For instance, I heard that one famous company is trying to create a robert who can take place of cooks in the restayrants."	I_S0
"After you set the ingredients of your meals and what kind of taste you like, the robert can cook it by itself."	I_S0
"In the same time, you can finish your work or watch your favourate movies."	I_S0
"It is obvious that highly developed technology do help us get away with cooking and preparing foods in twenty years."	E_S0
"Another reason in that we do not need to cook food, for the service industry will be completed."	S_M1
"As the time goes by, new restaurants which can supply all kinds of foods will appear and the delivery  of food can be more convient."	B_S0
"Therefore, we can get food from the restaurants quickly instead of spending too much time cooking and preparing it."	I_S0
"As we all know, we can buy food though application such as "MeiTuan"  and food will be delivered to us in less that  one year."	I_S0
"Maybe in the future, as soon as we call the restaurant to order a meal, a helicopter apper out of our window with the hot meal."	E_S0
"I think people will refuse to cook by themselves and order meal"	O
 
"The city hospital changed great a lot from 2007 to 2010."	S_I0
"Starting from the city road,there used to be a crossing road,but it changed into a roundabout since 2007."	S_M1
"Along the hospital road,on the right side ,the car park place was for staff and public,but now it is only for staff."	B_S1
"Then a bus station is added on its left side which connected with two roundabouts."	E_S1
"The city hospital surrounded by the ring road is still there."	S_M1
"And the public car park has moved to the east of the ring road."	S_S2
 
"Once i attended a lecture,i was enjoying those professor's statment until one of the professor said:"Poor people cannot be as intelligent as those wealthy.""	B_I0
"And i was completely shocked since this saying was very discriminatory to poor students."	I_I0
"Therefore, i stood up and interrupt the professor to correct what he had said."	I_I0
"However, afterward i recieve many negative comments because i corrected professor's statment during his lecture."	I_I0
"And this thing leads me to think if i meet this thing again in the future, i should do the same thing as before, be quiet, or correct him after he finishs the whole lecture."	E_I0
"In my opinion, i perfer the second method."	S_T0
"First of all, the second way has more positive impact on other listeners."	S_M2
"Since the meeting leader says his ideas in the meeting room, there are many other person who listen carefully to the meeting with you in the meanwhile."	B_S0
"If you just open your mouth and say "I don't argee with your ideas.", you may interrupt others' thinking despite of the leader's statment."	I_S0
"As we all know, you should feel for others when you decide to do something that will infect others."	I_S0
"For example, if you're thinking a math problem and suddenly your mother comes to your room and exclaims that you should eat dinner, you will be angery and let her get out the room."	I_S0
"Similiarly, if you interrupt others' thinking, they will be mad at your behavior and maybe think you as a inpolite person."	I_S0
"As a result, the first method would leaves bad impression."	I_S0
"Furthermore, the third method is not very intelligent."	I_S0
"If the meetin leader really says something that many people don't agree but you say nothing about it, other people will think you have the same opinion as the meetin leader even though you just don't want to correct his statment."	I_S0
"Thereby, others maybe have some bad comments on you and you maybe hurt in both mental and physical by their verbal attack."	I_S0
"Consequently, the first and the last solution both have negetive impact on you and they're not suitable resolution to this complex circumstance."	E_S0
"Moreover, i think the second way make sure the me"	O
 
"In recent years,there is an extensive debate among people."	S_T0
"Some people argue that iiving in urban area has a negative impact on citizens' healthy conditions."	B_S0
"To be hones, I think that although these nagetive impacts can not be ignored, the advantages still ovweweight these issues."	I_S0
"There is no doubt that living in cities might affect adversely people' health."	I_S0
"For example,due to increasely the number of vehicles and contruction of factories in cities,the amount of waste gases produced by them see an increase and air pollution is more serious."	I_S0
"Therefore people living in cities are more likely suffer from diseases related to respiratory than those living in countryside where there are normally fewer environmental  problems caused by cars and facrories."	I_S0
"Besides,people who live in cities always live under heavier pessure due to the fast-paced life ,which might lead to some mental diseases."	I_S0
"However,living in cities still has many benrfits to people's health."	I_S0
"Obviously."	I_S0
"hospitals in cities have more advanced facilities and more specialists so that those healthcare centers could provide better services to paticients who may recover faster than those who live in countryside and do no have access to well-equiped hospitals."	I_S0
"Besides,there are more sports facilities in cities and people could have more oppotunities to do daily exercises to strenghen their physical conditions
In conclusion,living in cities has a positive impact on people' s healthy conditions."	E_S0
 
"Recently, a noticiable topic arouse the inmemsely discussion: whether different types of works or similiar tasks all day satisified workers."	B_I0
"Varied people have distinct sights."	I_I0
"Some people think similar work can make people focus on the task they do, and people will do well in this work."	I_I0
"However, I hold the view that different kinds of assignments encourage people a lot."	E_I0
"My view can be elabrated as follow."	S_T0
"To begin with, varied tasks cultivate worker the ability of time management."	S_M1
"If people do many different works in a day, he should make a plan and arrange every hour work he should finish."	B_S0
"Handle a good work pace to complete all the task."	I_S0
"However, if a person who similiar work day by day, he will became quickly."	I_S0
"He will just finish the work without any plan, and he will lose the chance to get the ability of time management."	I_S0
"Imaging a person, he should make the marketing plan, order the standard work process, accout the revenue, each one of this is complicated, so he have to make the precisely plan in order to finish them."	I_S0
"It is crystal clearing that workers who want to get the ability of time management satisified in mutiply tasks."	E_S0
"In addition, different kinds of tasks make workers have creative thinking."	S_M1
"People are able to find the connection in different works, through which may inspire them improve the working methods and company strategies."	B_S0
"It is also a kind of creative thinking from interaction of different works."	I_S0
"In opposite, people who do similiar work all the time will not be access to new thing."	I_S0
"They can not get insight from the work."	E_S0
"To sum up, i convince that different is the better onit is not only can develop the time management skills but also get creative thinking and inspiration from doing different types of work."	S_C2
 
"I will take a neutral stance on this issue that pressure in our lives helps us set and achieve greater goals."	S_T0
"Actually, this pressure in our lives has two sides to explain."	S_M1
"The main cause is on human themselves."	B_S1
"If you could not sustain the pressure, on the other words,"	E_S1
"If you are so sensitive or you are not strong enough, you will never set and achieve your goal by this way."	S_M1
"The some Japanese pexperts claim that there are sixty percent of people dead cause many differend kinds of pressure, such as working, studying, living..."	B_S1
"Their mentality are so weak that they can not sustain it."	E_S1
"On the positive side, In one hundred percent of people, there are only about five percent of people could be successful."	S_C2
"Why?"	B_S0
"It is just since they have pressure to push them to achieve their goals."	I_S0
"It also called ' a kind of passive way to success '."	I_S0
"These are kinds of strong people."	E_S0

"This could be explained by the fact that they probably lack learning abilities since a year has passed because of different circustance 
that the complicated social experience might cause these immature youngsters to lose patience in doing academic researches."	S_S2
"In my oponion, young people might find it tough to do such heavy workloads."	S_M0
"Because they are these students just fresh out of schools, they do not have enough working capabilities."	B_S1
"So somtimes they not noly lack expertise in sector but also not have a good command of international communication so when problems connected to people occur, it is especially hard for them to tackle."	E_S1

"I agree with it because in this way parents can motivate their children to study hard and this method can help children to develop a good habit of spending money reasonablely."	E_T1
"To begin with,giving children money for high mark can motivate children to study hard in the school."	S_M0
"School children always want to get noney for what they love."	B_S0

"The first aspect of 'relax' is to relax our body."	S_M0
"Obviously,watching a movie or reading a book while seated in an armchair beats perfectly doing physical exercise while straining our muscles and being exhausted."	B_S1
"The former hits the goal of relaxing,whereas the latter rushes to the contrary."	E_S1
"The second aspect,and the more abstrat one,is to relax our mind."	S_M0
"In this realm the former also wins the competition."	B_S0
"By watching a movie or reading a book,we delve into a wonderful world of stories where we hand our mind completely out to the author,and need not think harshly on ourselves (we could not have books of hieroglyphs or difficult maths descriptions to relax!)."	I_S0
"The former method will have our sight and mind led by the ongoing process of the story without losing too much of  our brain cells."	I_S0
"Doing physical exercise,however,drags us into a challenge."	I_S0
"Even if we avoid fierce,competitive sports which George Orwell once stated as 'provoking hatred',we are faced with the battle of our mind and our sore muscles in jogging,consistent requirement of willpower in yoga,etc.."	I_S0
"In that case,the former also performs much better in relaxing our mind than the latter."	E_S0
"In summary,watching a movie or reading a book is indeed a better choice instead of doing physical exercise when it comes to the key word 'relax',and in both flesh and spirit aspects I agree with the statement."	S_C2
 
"When it comes to the development of public tansport system,there are conflicting views on whether public money should be spent on the construction of new railway lines connecting different cities or on the improvement of current transportation network."	B_T1
"From my perspective, it depends on the economy condition of the country."	I_T1
"Many people find construcing new railway lines more urgent,so that a new life can be injected into the country's economy."	I_T1
"With a developed railway system beween large cities,it would be more convenient to deliver goods and  raw materials,thus cutting down the cost of delivery."	I_T1
"In this way,manufacturers are able to produce products at a lower cost and a quicker rate,and as a result become more competitive in the local and even international market,which is benificial to the development of economy"	E_T1
"Those who feel that improving existing public transport more necessary claims that a better public transpot system could benifit the environment."	S_M2
"If people have more effective public means of transportation such as buses and subway,they are likely to choose those as ways to go out instead of private vehicles."	B_S0
"Consequently,there will probably be less air pollution in major cities as gas emission will possibly drop,while railway lines beteen cities is less likely to promise this prospect."	I_S0
"Personally,I think that on no account should the country's own economy circumstances be ignored when deciding on this issue."	I_S0
"In less-developed countries where it is urgent to stimulate economy growth,more attehtion should be paid to the construction of railway lines between cities."	I_S0
"Meanwhile,with people already enjoying a high living standard,the developed countires should focus on the protection of environment,thereby improving their existing public transport."	E_S0
 
"Sorry,i don't know what can i write."	S_T1
"Ahhhhh..."	B_S1
"But it is important for families to eat eat together."	E_S1
 
"The reading passage gives three methods to protect the endangered Torreya."	B_I0
"However, the professor presente that none of these methods will work, which completely contradists the points illustrated in the reading passage."	E_I0
"Firstly, the passage illustrates that we can move the Torreya to where it thrived for thousands of years, Northern Florida, where the micro climate is very favorable to Torreya's growth."	S_M0
"On the contrary, the professor demonstrates that it is unlikely to success."	B_S1
"The climate is no longer suit for the Torreya to grow because it is drier now due to global warming or the dried wet land."	E_S1
"Secondly, the suggestion in the passage is that  moving the Torreya to an entirely different location."	S_M0
"Neverthless, this is also refuted by the professor that   the black local tree, which was moved to a new place, spreaded rapidly and killed a lot of other trees and animals some of which were about to extinct."	B_S1
"Therefore, this is not a good way to protect Torreya since it probably cause more damage."	E_S1
"Finally, the professor disproves the reading's idea that scientists can preserve Torreya in research centers."	S_M0
"Actually, the professor justified that to survive the disease, the Torreya needs large population and diversity."	B_S0
"However, the scientists don't hve the capacity to preserve such a large amount of Torreya in the lab."	I_S0
"Therefore, ev they can move the Torreya to the research center, they cannot ensure that the Torreya can survive the diseases."	E_S0
 
"In my opinion, it is very hard to say "good" or "bad" absolutely."	B_T0
"As we all know, everything has its advantage and disadvantage."	I_T0
"So I could only say that these parents' behavior is resonable."	E_T0
"The advantage for parents to do so is that when their children are still a student, it is very important for them to study well and acquire more knowledge."	S_M0
"To do well in study, they certainly need to devote themselves to it and they may not have enough time to make money themselves."	B_S1
"So parents can give them a hand."	E_S1
"And the disadvantage is that if parents give money to their kids, the children will lose a lot of opportunities to work, improve themselves and be more able when making money themselves."	S_M0
"Actually the benifit their experience to work can bring is far more than the money they made, this kind of experinces can make children know more about the sociaty, become more hard-working and diligent."	B_S0
"After woking, they will know that it is not easy for our parents to support us, so they may also become more responsible."	I_S0
"And all these good qualities will certainly bring them a brighter future."	E_S0
"I think whether it is good for parents to offer their school-age children money depends on the condition and personality of the child himself."	S_M0
"If a child who do very bad in his study is very outgoing or once had this kind of experice, parents can consider give him money and let him study hard."	B_S1
"But as for a student who do not has many problems in school, I think he is supposed to earn money himself."	E_S1
"So the two ways are both resonable, and relatively speaking, I think it is better for a child to make money by himself and have more experience."	S_C2
 
"With the development of society, more and more people have the opportunity to have higher education."	S_I0
"This means that talent will be more and more than before, and the knowledge that a person is given is increasing diverse and rich."	S_T0
"Many people think that in the present society, they have too many choices."	S_T1
"In my opinion, this is beyond doubt."	S_T0
"First, get higher education gives those who work hard the right to choose."	S_M1
"For example, when a person needs to find a job in the future, a good job usually requires a good resume, and what the resume contains is your GPA and your performance evaluation in school."	B_S0
"Sometimes it also has a teacher recommendation."	I_S0
"Only when you have a good resume, you can have more options in the future."	E_S0
"The second is the diversity of society today."	S_M1
"With social diversify, people can choose to engage in more fields."	B_S0
"More emerging areas may became hot in the future, and people are no longer confined to learning is the only way to get better in the future."	I_S0
"Such as professional e-sports players, in the e-sports industry, they are now very common."	E_S0
"To sum up, people have more choices not only because of themselves, but also because the society needs more and more talents and  innovation."	S_C2
 
"The two plans shows the changes have happened in a park since 1920."	B_I0
"In 1920, the fountain was in the centre of the park, and there were two entrances on the north and south of the park."	I_I0
"There were three rosen garden dot the park with seats near them."	I_I0
"Now, there is a square rose garden in the centre with seats around it."	I_I0
"And on its west, an amphitheatre for cnocerts was built."	I_I0
"There is a water feature located in the south east corner of the park."	E_I0
"During these years, the fountain in the centre was replaced by the rose garden."	S_M2
"Similarly, the glass house and the pond for water plants were replaced by the children's play area and the water feature."	B_S1
"It is also worth mention that the stage for musicians was removed, and they build an amphitheatre for cnocerts at almost the same place."	E_S1
"Overall, comparing the two maps, we can discover significant changes after this development."	B_C1
"However, the two entrances and the rose garden on the north west corner had remained unchanged during this period."	E_C1
 
"The professor in the lecture said that there a few things that can doubt on the points in the reading."	B_I0
"Firstly, scientists has found little evidence suggesting that they possess violent temdencies."	I_I0
"But as the passage refered, the research has begun recent years."	I_I0
"According to the professor, the research began in 1970s which is a short time for the observation."	E_I0
"Secondly, as the passage said, some of the data in the research is mostly acquired from the zookeepers."	S_M1
"The bonobos in capitivity may be gentle than the wilde bonobos."	B_S0
"So, the data is not conventional."	I_S0
"And also, they only observed hunderds of the animals, but compare to the colossal amount of the wilde bonobos this is a tiny number."	E_S0
"Thirdly, they have compared the bonobos with the chimpanzees and drawed their conclusion that the bonobos is less violent than them."	S_M1
"But they haven't considered the human activities reduce the vegitation the chimpanzees could eat."	B_S0
"So in the end they can only hunt little animals to feed themselves."	I_S0
"But the bonobos haven't been affected by humen too much."	E_S0
"So the professor thought it was a unbelievable resaerch based on these evidence."	S_C2
 
"A considerable amount of people these davs are deciding to work for themselves instead of someone else at a company."	S_T1
"The following essay will discuss the reasons for this trend and any problems people may face being their own boss."	O
"Looking at possible reasons to begin with,I think one of the main factors was the 2008 crash which placed the entire planet into recession."	S_M2
"This is something from which we,as a global economy,have only just recovered,and in many places,are still recovering."	B_S0
"Companies laid off people by the thousands and with the amount of job losses that were encountered,I believe that it makes a lot of sense to work for yourself."	I_S0
"My father,as an example,worked in the banking sector at that time and was one of the first to be made redundant."	I_S0
"He struggled to work for many months,until he decided to offer financial services as an independent consultant."	I_S0
"Now,he is much happier,and I believe more stable,than he was before."	E_S0
"In conclusion,while starting a small business may be the correct move for some,it is not ctiaxervone and,to overcome the downward trend or long-term survival needs dedication nersistence,customers and pernaps most or all,luck."	S_C2
 
"The two maps displays the whole view of the village for Stokeford ,compared that in 1930 and in 2010."	B_I0
"As we can see, the largest difference in Stokeford should be the development of house regions, which converted two large parts of farmlands into houses of residence."	I_I0
"There used to be lots of farmlands in the northeast and along the river Stoke in 1930, however, they disappeared in 2010 and are replaced by plenty of houses."	I_I0
"And the old shops are also transformed into houses."	I_I0
"Only the post office is still standing in front of the primary school."	I_I0
"Besides, the primary school in the east has been expanded, so that students could have more room to study in."	E_I0
"What is more, the place for gardens in the southeast in1930 has been cut down and is used for building houses as well."	S_M2
"While the large houses behind the gardens are converted into retirement home and two more houses have been constructed for enlarging the retirement home."	S_S2
"In general, we could see a large amount of changes have taken place in stokeford, the village is developing rapidly from 1930 to 2010."	S_C2
 
"The diagram shows the changes in the number of people 65 years old over the period from 1940 to 2040."	B_I0
"In 1940, Japan had the smallest population over 65, with Sweden second only to the United States."	I_I0
"With the development of the society, the population of Sweden and the United States over the age of 65 is slowly rising, while the population of Japan is on a declining trend."	E_I0
"Around 1990, Japan's population of 65 years old began to rise, while that of the United States and Sweden gradually leveled off, and Sweden grew rapidly after 1990 and surpassed the United States."	S_T1
"In the 21st century, except for the United States, the population of Sweden and Japan over the age of 65 is still on the rise, and the number of elderly people in Sweden accounts for 20% of the total population around 2010."	S_M2
"By around 2030, the population aging degree of the three countries of the United States, Japan and Sweden is rising rapidly."	B_S0
"In particular, Japan has reached 25% of its population before and after 2030, which is much higher than that of Sweden and the United States."	I_S0
"However, it will be alleviated by 2040."	E_S0
 
"There are some causes of the phenomenon."	S_T1
"First of all,there may have some relations with teaching method,the teacher usually hope their students have great note,so the method of teaching maybe violent,they do not care the ideas of students,after leaving schools, students still do not have correct habits on studing,so they may have probably negative thoughts."	B_S0
"secondly,students are stressed,the parents give presures to their child,students are afraid of their parents."	I_S0
"thirdly, some influences by classmates,they study with other students every day, so they will have some commun points in some way."	I_S0
"classmates may give some negative thoughts."	I_S0
"To improve the situation,we have some suggests."	I_S0
"At first, we should improve the teaching skill of teacher."	I_S0
"they should not only care about  the note of students, but also more important how students think about."	I_S0
"It is more important to teachers, they should not only teach the knowledge, but also the correct values."	I_S0
"in fact, the thoughts of students depend mostly on teachers."	I_S0
"Next,the parents should change their mind,the education about child in not only the study, but also principle of life."	I_S0
"children have many things to learn,and parents are the best teacher of them."	I_S0
"so it is very important to change and improve the mind of parents."	I_S0
"Finally,the students should recognise the good thing and the bad things,so it is important to make the correct friends."	I_S0
"they should improve each other,but not make each other to go bad."	I_S0
"If the students can have correct values from their parents,teachers and classmates,they will not have negative thoughts and it will make sense of the whole society."	I_S0
"They will become more and more successful."	E_S0
 
"Due to many governments consider that it is necessary to put economic development at the top of their list."	S_I0
"As for me, in spite of its exclusive advantage, some more compeling issues should be given the top prority in energy allocation."	S_T1
"Admittedly the improvement of economy will bring benefits to the improvement of people's living standards."	S_M1
"It will help whether it is food, clothing, housing, travel and entertainment, and so on, it will also be a virtuous circle and drive the development of all walks of life, because economy is the foundation."	S_S2
"However i don't think economic development should be put at the top of government's attention, because education, scientific research, environmental is also important."	S_M1
"Basically, although economic development will bring timely effects and benefits, in the long run, scienfic research will not get immediate results, but if it be successful, it will lead to greater changes in human development."	B_S0
"Beyond such as space exploration and the birth of the internet, will let us enter another area."	I_S0
"In addition, for example, education is the foundation of human develoopment."	I_S0
"Oly with good education can children have better development, which directly affects the quality of human beings."	I_S0
"On top of it, if we don't pay attention to environmental protection, some resources may be consumed in a short period of time."	I_S0
"Alothough it won't have a great impact in the short term, it will also cause great harm to the future."	E_S0
"In conclusion, i think we should put economy, education, scientific research and environmental protection in the same improtant position."	S_C2
 
"Nowadays, the question about would the studeents use printed books any more in twenty years from now has become a mamatter concern of many people."	B_I0
"Some peopel believe that students will not use printed books any more, while others believe students still use oprinted books in twenty years ago."	E_I0
"I vote for the idea that students will not use printed books any more."	S_T1
"To begin with, the schools and companys are use less printed paper then before, msot of then are compile their documents at computer or mobile phone."	S_M0
"For example of my sister, her school's teachers assign homework are the internet, also the teachers ask their students finish homework at soem application."	B_S1
"Such as the chinese teacher, his homework are use the application to read some books, also he can get every students plan at his mobile phone."	E_S1
"Moreover, the printed book are too heavy for the students."	S_M0
"I still rember, when I was young, at the primary school and midle school, i need to finished almost 5 to 6 differents homework, which means I need to took 6 differents book to home."	B_S1
"If we put this book together is almost 5kg at least, so teh students in the future would not use printed books anymore."	E_S1
"Finally, we know the fact taht the printed books are mainly made form tress."	S_M0
"In view of the growing seriousness of the environments problems and green space are decreasing step bu step."	B_S0
"The printed books will be limited in the future."	I_S0
"Also, printed books are more expensive compare with E-books which is cheaper and easily affordable."	E_S0
"I strongly believe that children will not use printed book any more in twenty yearts from now, because od the modern trend, tireded of students and environments problems."	S_C2
 
"That the children have excellent performances is the parents' biggest hope."	B_I0
"The increasing number of parents use unreasonable sollution in order to accelerate their children's passion on study."	E_I0
"The common method is that the parents give their children money when they performing well in the school."	S_T1
"In my opinion, I totally disagree with this behavior."	S_T0
"In the first place, children are not mature enough when they face a lot of money."	S_M0
"As we know, some young boy cannot distinguish the right behavior and bad behavior."	B_S0
"A lot of children smoke and buy everything they want when they have a lot of money."	I_S0
"Take my brother as an instance."	I_S0
"My brother, Lee, did not good in school in the past and his mother told him that he will get a lot of money if he get good grade in the school."	I_S0
"He did that latter."	I_S0
"However, these moeny make him missing."	I_S0
"He always spend the money buying cigeratte and playing computer game, which made him hatreding the study."	I_S0
"Finally, these money bring a lot of negative impacts on himself."	I_S0
"Obviously, Giving money to children is not a good method to encourage boy performing well in the school."	E_S0
"In the second place, money-oriented education will makes the children get bad concepts."	S_M0
"Take myself as an instance."	B_S0
"I am a student and my father promised that if I get A grade he will give me money."	I_S0
"I am so happy and I study just for the money rather than improving myself."	I_S0
"Recently, I get a bad habbit that I do every thing just for money I will lose the passion onece I get the reward."	I_S0
"I lose the passion for the persuing knowledge gradually."	I_S0
"After that, I always ask money from my parents when I do tasks that are not connected with study."	E_S0
"Finally, there is a better way to accelerate the children's passion rather than giving them profits."	S_M0
"The most important thing is that parents let their children know the importance of the studying and studying is for themself rather than for others."	B_S1
"Onece children know that, they will work hard without any profits."	E_S1
"To sum up, I oppose the behavior that giving money for children."	B_C1
"This behavior just brings a lot negative impacts on them."	E_C1
 
"It is not uncommon that all walks of life can afford travel expenses no matter where they want to go because of the advanced transportations and personal wealth."	S_T1
"I suppose that scientists and toursits can get benefits if they travel to remote natural regions like the south pole,  although this phenomenon may have some negative influences."	B_S0
"An increasing number of tourists and scientists who intend to travel to remote natural areas may cause damage to the local environments and."	I_S0
"It is undeniable that some of them may have behavioural problems."	I_S0
"For example, they are likely to throw litter occasionally that may be eaten by some animals."	I_S0
"As a result, this may lead to their death."	I_S0
"Furthermore, this makes it possible to destory the biodiversity."	I_S0
"In addition, the arrival of people may lead to climate change and break the balance, thereby contributing to some creatures facing the verge of extinguishment."	I_S0
"However, it is worth mentioning that traveling to such places is beneficial to the social development and individuals."	I_S0
"scientists can make exploration in these places where there are abundant natural resources and some new creature they have never seen."	I_S0
"It is therefore easier to solve the energy crisis and develop the reasearch on the new creatures."	I_S0
"Apart from that, it is definitely great way for tourists to broden their horizons since remote natural environments can take on different views in camparison with these in the accessible places."	I_S0
"Besides, if they go to some places like the north pole, they are more likely to stay in a good mood due to spectacular scenery."	I_S0
"In conclusion, while this phenomenon has some disadvantages, i believe that its benefits outweigh its drawbacks."	E_S0
 
"These pie charts show us the inform about retail sectors sold online in New Zealand ."	B_I0

"but i think our parents always help us is not very good,becasue if always do that."	B_S0
"we not only can't get some help,but also will be bad."	I_S0
"so i think this is not very good for everyone,i think our parents should believe us,i think young people depended too much on their parents to make decisions for them,i think this is not very good and not very bad."	I_S0
"i think panent should believe him kid."	I_S0

"in family they can said his or her opinion, i think do this is very good for them,if parents always help him's kids,that kid will be bad everyday,so i think parent should believe them kid do something,i think this is very good for us."	I_S0
"and if parent believe us ,i think we will feel very happy,we will said whit some people ,my parents believe me,this feel is very good for me.because i can do something alone,they will think this feel is very good for us,if young people do something alone,they can imporve our lives skills, if  we can live alone,this serion our really grow up,if our parents listed to this,i think they will feel very good,and some poeple will said for me we think you is very good ,we will study to you ,if young people do this,they can teach him friends how to live alone,how to live alone very good ,and if you live alone very well,you can teach so many people how to live alone very good,maybe you can be a teacher."	E_S0
 
"It is now a common trend that students take a year off before they go to university."	S_T1
"Most of them chose to travel or work for a year."	B_S0
"Personally, the advantages of it outweigh the disadvantages."	I_S0
"Some people may argue that a one-year off would lessen students' interest and passion on study."	I_S0
"Students choosing to travel may be addicted to beatiful natural scenaries and for those who chose to work in society, they feel no more ambitions for study ."	I_S0
"These students may not turn to university for further education."	I_S0
"Others hold different thoughts."	I_S0
"A one-year off away from school could provide a great and precious opportunity for students to make perfect plans for their future."	I_S0
"After several years of school life consists of courses and examinations, students need a break and a vocation."	I_S0
"Travelling or getting an internship in companies would give them enough time  and space to think about their future plans when they go to university."	I_S0
"These experiences could provide them a fresh mood for the next university life."	I_S0
"In my opinion, making future plans plays an significant role in people's life, especially for students who wants to get further education."	I_S0
"A year's working experience could be valuable and coule be written in you CV while you want to get a job."	I_S0
"It can be a rehersal before your actual career begins."	I_S0
"Besides, a meaningful and joyful trip could calm your mind and relax your mood, which could give you a better condition to prepare for the campus life."	I_S0
"In conclusion, taking a year off to travel or work is a considerable choice for students and worth a try, for the advantages outweigh the disadvantages."	E_S0
 
"The diagrams detail the present construction of a sports centre and plans for its renovation."	B_I0
"Looking from an overall perspective, it is readily apparent that there are plans to remove the outdoor courts and expand the gym with additional facilities for swimming, changing, dancing, and activities largely unrelated to exercise like shopping and having coffee."	E_I0
"At the moment, the university’s main building is flanked by large outdoor courts."	S_M2
"The plan is to remove the western courts in favour of a leisure pool larger in size than the current pool, which will itself remain unchanged during renovations."	B_S0
"The entire main building will not undergo alterations including the changing rooms, reception and seating area."	I_S0
"The only slight exception is that the gym on the northern end of the building will be lengthened eastwards and connect with two new adjoining dance studios."	E_S0
"The outdoor court on the eastern side will be replaced by a sports hall and to the southeast of the sports hall the university will add an additional changing room (which is mirrored by the same room in the southwestern corner of the plans) and an abutting cafe to the west."	B_C1
"The large entrance area will not be impeded in any way but a new sports shop will open next to the westernmost changing room."	E_C1
 
"As far as I'm concerned, workers will be more satisfied when they have many different types of tasks to do than when they do similar tasks all day long."	S_T1
"First of all , doing similar tasks all day long ,as is known to all , will directly lead to workers' boringness."	S_M0
"Once if they get bored ,their moods will be impacted negatively ,let alone being satisfaied."	B_S1
"Thinking of typing forms in Excel all day long , I believe you could not stand the job like that, no matter how interesting or important the form is ."	E_S1
"Second ,finishing tasks of the same type may make workers get the feeling of repeating."	S_M0
"Consequently , they might have mental suggestion like they are doing something useless."	B_S1
"Conversely , if a person often changes the typs of his/her works, he /she will think himself/herself finish a lot of tasks , and obtain more career satisfactory."	E_S1
"Thirdly, colorful tasks will arouse workers' enthusiasm of work ,with which , workers become more efficient in daily working ."	S_M0
"The more theyhave done , formulating a positive circle of work."	S_S2
 
"The diagram display the way of electricity to generated from the hydroelectric force facility."	B_I0
"The station consist of 3 parts."	I_I0
"There are entrance, path and production."	E_I0
"In addition, the different places have various functions."	S_T1
"First, river come into high-level reservoir."	S_M1
"At the same time, a huge dam is on the right which is essential in the facility."	B_S0
"Moreover,  the intake is on the bottom of dam."	I_S0
"Also, it only open when sun on the sky."	I_S0
"In the evening, it would turn off."	E_S0
"Second, the flow of water to generate electricity would take in water in the day."	S_M1
"Obveresily, that would become different way at night."	B_S0
"Finally, the most essential part of diagram which looks like a square."	I_S0
"The reversible turbines also has two way to work."	I_S0
"One way is operate generator in the day."	I_S0
"The other way is pump water into high-level reservoir in the evening."	I_S0
"As well as, on the top of power station is generator, which is the power lines to national grid."	I_S0
"Besides, the right of entrance is low-level reservoir that come in the day, out in the night."	E_S0
"In my opinion, the hydroelectric power station is a gorgeous facility which is I have never been see."	S_C2
 
"I think the statement is totally true."	B_I0
"As the development of economy, an increasing number of people choose to buy their own cars, instead of using public traffic."	I_I0
"This, admittedly, has add to personal covenience, but, on the other hand, it also caused severe traffic jams in cities worldwide."	I_I0
"To control the number of private cars, my suggestions are as follows:
For a start, it is advisable for government to control the number of licence plate, because without a licence plate, people won't be able to drive cars even though they bought one."	I_I0
"Actually Beijing, a city that is said to suffer from the most severe traffic jam in China, has been applying this method for long."	E_I0
"People can only get a licence plate when they are chosen randomly, and, thanks to this, the number of private cars has been kept under good control in recent years."	S_T1
"Besides, if I were a government officer, I would devote myself to developing public transportaion, making it more convenient and cheaper."	S_M1
"If public transportation is flexible and confortable enough, and its cost is far lower than having a private car, people will no longger have the motivation to using private cars."	S_S2
"Additionally, education also plays an important role in car controling."	S_M1
"I believe culture is one of the factors that drive people to buy private cars."	B_S0
"In addition to a vehicle, a private car is also considered as a simble of wealth, especially in China."	I_S0
"Therefore, government should make some efforts to change people's minds."	I_S0
"For example, it might be a good idea to tell people that protecting our environment through using public transportation is a better way to show one's social status and knowledge level."	I_S0
"Only when people's minds are changed through education, can we efficiently control the number of private cars."	E_S0
"To sum up, the growing number of private cars has resulted in traffic jams in many cities, but I firmly believe that we can take this situation under control if we could limit the number of licence plate, develop public trasportation, and change people's mind through education."	S_C2
 
"How to let young children learn to differentiate right from wrong is a permanent issue for would-be parents and a frequently used approach is punishment."	B_S0
"To my mind, punishment is essential when teaching children about the difference between right and wrong as long as the punishment is carried out properly."	I_S0
"On the one hand, everybody learn something by trying and checking consequences."	I_S0
"If one attempts to do something but fails or gets negative results, he will not be likely to do it again, thus he will know it is wrong."	I_S0
"In this feedback learning method, punishment, which is intentionally imposed by people, plays the role of bad consequences in order to keep mistake makers from performing wrong behaviour again."	I_S0
"For instance, children often fight with peers or brothers and sisters, and a usual punishment for this is to make children grounded."	I_S0
"When they are grounded, they are not able to do anything but sitting, which is absolutely boring."	I_S0
"Therefore, they will gradually link this terrible experience with those acts they did and consider that behaviour as wrong."	I_S0
"On the other hand, some people argue that many punishments do harm to children physically and spiritually."	I_S0
"It is hard to deny that punishments like hitting or writing an article in which children call themselves 'idiot' pose a threat to children's growth, but we can avoid these sorts of punishment by using proper alternatives that are not harmful for their bodies and mind."	I_S0
"One of the successful examples is forcing children to count numbers from 1 to 1000."	I_S0
"In this way, children are not only told to do something tedious, which is regarded as punishment, but also acquire a better ability of counting and a more acute sense of mathematics."	I_S0
"They learn what is good behaviour as they are punished if they did something bad, as well as skills and knowledge if punishement is designed with an educative purpose."	I_S0
"Overall, I agree with the idea that punishent is necessary to help children distinct right from wrong."	I_S0
"However, only healthy punishments can be carried out and punishments with educational pur"	E_S0
 
"The lecturer believes the theories proposed in the reading passage to be inadequte to ease the pressure which deforestation has imposed on the ecosystem."	B_I0
"The international fund, the lecturer argues, is deeply flawed in that it wouldn't improve the situation, instead be detrimental to the enviroment."	E_I0
"First, by alloting the fund to industries resisting the logging one would lead to increased farming activities."	S_M0
"The lecturer considers agriculture a far more damaging industry than logging."	B_S0
"The constantly amassing populaton would lead to clearing more forests for human habitats."	I_S0
"The high demand for food would require the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides that are pernicious to the soil and water."	E_S0
"Second, the lectuerer doubt the fund would go to the villager and the tribal communities by providing a stipends."	S_M0
"It would most likely go to the land owners and the government who prefer more profitable industries like conmmercial farming."	S_S2
"Lastly, planting tree may help relieve the dire issue but it may harm the bioversity of the area."	S_M0
"Because governments and the land owners, provided the fund, would plant trees and corps that have high commercial value."	S_S2
"In all, the listening passage highly doubts that the methods put forth by the author would benefit the enviroment."	S_C2
 
"Nowadays,there are more people choosing to be self-employed,rather than being employed by a company or organisation."	B_T0
"Personally,I believe that the phenomenon can be explained by many reasons."	I_T0
"Obviously,people are dislike to be managed,especially when your idea is conflicted to your managers'."	I_T0
"Most of us have to discard our thought reluctantly in these circumstances."	I_T0
"Another is that some presume that being self-employed earns more money than being employed."	E_T0
"The other is that with being self-employed,you may have your own career,own brand,or own company,and some people target it as a pivotal goal on their lives."	B_S0
"Although being self-employed seems so attractive that many people are drawn to it,there's several disadvantages of it."	I_S0
"One is that you have to undertake all the risks."	I_S0
"For example,my dad is a boss of a company."	I_S0
"One time the upstream vendor collapse accidentlally,my dad had to meet up all the loss of his consumers because he is who consumers could only sink for."	E_S0
"The other is that you must have far more things to do compared to being just an employee."	S_M2
"You need to take the responsibilities of all things ,and that can lead to an extended work hours."	B_S0
"As my dad does, he goes to the company whenever any problems happen."	I_S0
"Comparing being self-employed and being employed,there's no only answer of which is better."	E_S0
"In a sum ,the answer depends on everyone's characteristic and their own life-goal."	B_C1
"But one is for sure,success is for the one who works harder in their choose."	E_C1
 
"A phenomenon of competition among children are very common so that some people argue that children should be encouraged to become competitive, while i disgree with this view and i think it is more important to cooperate with others."	S_T1
"It is true that competition skill is very useful and necessary for children who have to face a lot of competition at a young age."	B_S0
"A sense of competition brings children enough motivation to finish some tasks."	I_S0
"To give an example, in some Asian countries, students have to compete with others to earn teachers' prize as only the winner can get it which competitive sense can promote children to fight for themselves."	I_S0
"what is more, forming a sense of competition in children's mind since they are young, they can be accustomed to  more serious competion earlier in their later study or even in society."	I_S0
"This can also help them to become a more excellent people to contribute to society and be a good memeber of it."	I_S0
"However, comparing to encouraging children to be competitive, a good habit of cooperating with others are more beneficial for them."	I_S0
"cooperating with others means children can use different resources they may not have themselves which can help them to complete their task better."	I_S0
"Also, it is more efficient and effective when children have someone to cooperate so that they can save more time to do other work."	I_S0
"Another contributing factor is that a people who are good at cooperating with others always get along well with groups which is helpful for chidren to become a generous man rather that a self-centered one and it is important for children's growth and development."	I_S0
"In conclusion, a sense of competition is needed for children's improvement but there has to be a limitation and learning how to cooperate is more valuable in today's society."	E_S0
 
"I think we live in a society where there are many choices, but I don't think there are too many choices now."	B_T0
"With the continuous progress of society and the gradual diversification of the world, these are bound to mean that the choices that can be given to us will be more and more diversified, so that we will have more choices."	E_T0
"For us students, in the past many years, maybe the only way out for you in the eyes of your parents is to go to school."	S_M2
"But now, with the change of society, there are many technical talents, who are no less important to the society than knowledge talents, so many students will reconsider their development direction when they take the college entrance examination."	B_S0
"So this is the convenience that more choices bring to us students."	I_S0
"There are many examples like this, which are all the benefits that more choices bring to us."	I_S0
"Whether it is a student or not, I think it is a good thing that people have more choices, which can make our life more full of surprises and changes, rather than the kind of life that can see the end at a glance."	E_S0
"And I think that society has always had many choices, and the choice in modern society may depend on how we choose among the choices, only in this way can we make our colorful life."	S_C2
"Choice exists all the time."	B_S0
"I even think that people live in this world and everything they do every day is a process of choice."	I_S0
"Therefore, there is no such thing as whether there are too many choices in modern society."	E_S0
 
"Last month, my math teacher, Tony, asked us to accomplish assignement about geometry in groups."	B_I0
"However, some students determined to fulfill the task by themselves."	I_I0
"Later, the students who decided to do assignment performed terriblely."	I_I0
"Neither they found some new ideas to solve the problem, nor they used the primitive way to get the answer."	I_I0
"Well, recently, an interesting question comes out whether a student learn much more effectively than when they are asked to work alone on projects, when teachers assign projects on which students must work together."	E_I0
"Some people may choose to work alone cause they do not want to be distracted."	S_T0
"However, according to what I experienced before, I definitely comply the teachers' order and believe that the teacher is right."	B_S1
"Here are some ideas and example to support my view."	E_S1
"To begin with, teachers may consider that the task is very hard for the individual."	S_M2
"So working in groups may improve the study efficiency."	B_S0
"However, if one decides to do it alone, he or she might not solve the problem and waste much of time with nothing worked out."	I_S0
"For instance, according to the experience before, my teacher Tony, obviously realized that the geometry might be hard for us."	I_S0
"In order to help us accquire much knowledge, he asked us to work together."	I_S0
"Finally, my group succeeded to solve the problem with the help of each other."	I_S0
"In contrast, the students who try to do it alone work out nothing."	E_S0
"Secondly, working together may help us broad our views and exposes us with the new ideas raised by others."	B_C0
"There is no doubt that students need to discuss when they work in group."	I_C0
"Last time, our biology teacher asked us to do a survey in my campus and designed a new way to learn the birds."	E_C0
"My teamate Tom designed an efficient experiment to get the information from the birds and everone is impressed by this experiment."	B_S0
"At last, we got the first prize in the final evaluation."	I_S0
"Clearly, working together could help ones learn a lot."	E_S0
 
"In recent years, as more children have the right of education, it's more commen for parents to reward children who get good grades with money."	S_T1
"Though money seems like the thing that unsuit for young people, in my opinion, parents offering money for high grades is a good idea which I think has two main reasons."	S_T0
"Belows are the detail of them."	S_T1
"On the one hand, there aren't any diferences between money and other things if they are used as rewards,because both of them can encarage children's spirit."	S_M0
"Some usual rewards like toys and books may be seen to have pratical use."	B_S0
"But if children use money to buy things that can be used pratically, the result is the same."	I_S0
"So as for the useing way, money is like other rewards."	E_S0
"On the other hand, money can help children have the concept of saving an earing at an early age,which is benificial for their later life."	S_M0
"There is a commen problem that plenty of freshmen in the society aren't able to use their money properly, always wasting a lot or saving too much."	B_S0
"So if children begin to think how to use money early, they will have more experience when they enter the work area."	I_S0
"Even if they make some mistakes about the usage,the hole can be make up."	E_S0
"However, it must be admitted that handling with money early has an unavoidable problem, which is that children have the possibility of holding a mistake concept of the power of it."	S_M0
"To be detailed, if young people not use money on the right things, for example, purchasing too many luxuries or spending on computer games, they will sink in the loop of using money inappreciatly."	S_S2
"After all, offering money for children's good grades is a good idea, but at the same time ,parents should help children have the corect concept"	O
 
"I am convinceed that the better medical care has more benifits than the bad ."	S_T1
"Showing three cases for example, as we could live for more days, ourselves may be happier, our nations would be stronger, and our society could be more harmour."	B_S0
"We have more time to accompany our families and teach the descents."	I_S0
"More beauties could be seen whether in virtural or in thought."	I_S0
"More problems could be covered by scientists."	I_S0
"And as a result, the nations would become more powerful with these people."	E_S0
 
"People have different views about how much choice students should have with regard to what they can study at university."	B_T0
"While some argue that it would be better for students to be forced into certain key subject areas, I believe that everyone should be able to study the course of their choice."	E_T0
"There are various reasons why people believe that universities should only offer subjects that will be useful in the future."	S_M1
"They may assert that university courses like medicine, engineering and information technology are more likely to be beneficial than certain art degrees."	B_S0
"From a personal perspective, it can be argued that these courses provide more job opportunities, career progression, better salaries, and therefore an improved quality of life for students who take them."	I_S0
"On the societal level, by forcing people to choose particular university subjects, governments can ensure that any knowledge and skill gaps in the economy are covered."	I_S0
"Finally, a focus on technology in higher education could lead to new inventions, economic growth, and greater future prosperity."	E_S0
"In spite of these arguments, I believe that university students should be free to choose their preferred areas of study."	S_M1
"In my opinion, society will benefit more if our students are passionate about what they are learning."	B_S0
"Besides, nobody can really predict which areas of knowledge will be most useful to society in the future, and it may be that employers begin to value creative thinking skills above practical or technical skills."	I_S0
"If this were the case, perhaps we would need more students of art, history and philosophy than of science or technology."	E_S0
"In conclusion, although it might seem sensible for universities to focus only on the most useful subjects, I personally prefer the current system in which people have the right to study whatever they like."	S_C2
 
"For thiis statement, I am not so agrree with it."	B_I0
"I think it is better to relax, if you do physical exercise."	I_I0
"why?"	I_I0
"when I was in Germany, I have many works to do for example, I have to listing german Classes and at the same time I have to perare chinese law exam."	I_I0
"And the most heavy pressure is from my homesickness."	I_I0
"After half a year stayed in foreighn country and could't celebrate chinese new year with my parents."	I_I0
"At first, I saw many chinese talk show and movies to convey many stress."	I_I0
"I have to say, it worked in few days."	I_I0
"But after the movie or the novle, my anxiousiliy was back and it was strongly."	I_I0
"So I have changed my strategy."	I_I0
"Every morning I will run with my friend, I remmber those days are spring, I can see the sunrise when I run along the revier and I can saw the friendly housekeepeer with a big smile."	I_I0

"If you stayed in room alone with the lonely air, you will be more stressful."	B_S1
"With a comedy film you may laugh for 2 or 3 hours but if unfortunatly you choose a tradgy film, you will be more sad."	E_S1
"And exercise will give you a healthy body and with this you can do everything with active action and can barely feel tired."	S_M1
"In tthis situation you will easier to make success."	B_S1
"For most of the people, if they do things successfully their feel for happiness will crease and the same time the stress will decrease."	E_S1
"There are many ways to relax ourselves, I have to say that watching films and reading  books are good ways,but they are not the best way."	S_M1
"Only if we make us stronger can we manke things better, and exercises can not only make our body strong and health, but also make our mind more strong because in sport we push ourselves to make more."	S_S2
"So let's exercise for a better life."	S_C2
 
"The table shows how many visitors went to Ashdown Museum during the years before and after it is refurbished ."	B_I0
"It is obvious that the number of visitors increased significantly from 74000 to 92000 after it had been revamped."	E_I0
"The pie charts compare the result of surveys for people's satisfaction during the same two periods."	S_M1
"The year before refurbishment showed a negative pattern: only 15% of the visitors were very satisfied and the number of dissatisfaction occupied 40%."	S_S2
"After the refurbishment , the number of dissatisfied visitors declined to 15%."	S_M1
"The number of those who are very dissatisfied also dropped by 5%."	B_S0
"By contrast, people who were very satisfied rose  to 35%."	I_S0
"We can also see an upward trend in the number of satisfied people, rising from 30% to 40%."	I_S0
"Interestingly enough, in each time, 5% of visitors give no response."	E_S0
"Overall, we can say that all work that has been done to attract new visitors to Ashdown Museum has reached its aim."	S_S2
 
"The two pic charts compare the percentages of online sales across different retail sectors in New Zealand in the years 2003 and 2013."	B_I0
"For three of the sectors, it is evident that over this time frame there was significant change in their proportion of online transactions."	E_I0
"To travelling sector accounted for the majority of online sales in 2003 is 36 percent, and then it will dropped into 29 percent."	S_M2
"At 24 percent about film and music sector is popular in 2003, but it declined into 16 percent in 2013 ."	B_S0

"As the population of human growth each year, more and more couples having problem about how to educate their chidren."	S_I0
"Some parents believe that kids should be well behaved without making mistakes on everything, while others hold the perspective that children are able to gain experience from their mistakes."	B_T0
"In my opinion, children are ought to make mistakes."	E_T0
"First of all, mistakes can not be avoid."	S_M0
"As all we know, everyone will do something wrong nearly everyday, even adults sometimes make mistake by accidents."	B_S0
"Therefore, punishing children who make mistakes seems not fair."	I_S0
"For instance, when I was four years old, my mather asked me to hold a bowl of rice for her; however, I broke the bowl because I did not expect the bowl to be so heavy."	I_S0
"My mother did not blame me for that, she said I did not do it on purpose."	I_S0
"After that, I remembered that a bowl of rice weight like a huge rock, so I use my whole strength to hold it ever since."	I_S0
"For the above reasons, parents should forgive their kids when they make mistakes."	E_S0
"Secondly, when children learn lessons form mistakes, they will have a deeper impression because they tried."	S_M0
"In schools, teachers usually let students to do practical work after teachers teach them the theory."	S_S2
"It is the same when the young make mistakes."	S_M0
"Even if a child do not believe parents' words about what they should not do, they would quickly understand if they tried and failed."	B_S0
"My uncle told my cousin not to play with electricity, but my cousin did not listen to him."	I_S0
"One day, my cousin put his thumb in to the plug, he was shocked by the electric current and sent to the hosipital."	I_S0
"My uncle told me that my cousin would never get close to the plug after he retrieved."	E_S0
"Last but not least, parents who allow children to make mistake usually have a harmonious relationship in their family."	S_M0
"Teenagers are usually curious and rebillious, so they seldom follow their parents' words."	B_S0
"Teenagers usually do things that their guardian prohibit them from, and when their parents find out, parents would only accuse them for doing it."	I_S0
"As a result, their relationship get worse and their children still do not listen to them."	I_S0
"In this case, if their parents allow them to make mistakes, they will turn over when they fail or hurt themselves, and they would follow their parents with out having conflicts with them."	E_S0
"All in all, permit children to make mistakes is vital in parenting."	B_C0
"It helps parents to be strongly bonded to their children for not following parents' words seems unwise after children make mistakes."	I_C0
"Children can also benefit that they can learn lessons from it."	E_C0
 
"Grange Park was opened in 1920, a rectangular area with access from Arnold Avenue on the north side and from Eldon Street on the south side."	B_I0
"There was a fountain in the centre, with a stage for musicians situated centre left, a glasshouse to the right of the Eldon Street entrance and a pond for water plants in the north east corner opposite."	I_I0
"Around the edges of the park there were rose gardens, with seats nearby for people to smell the flowers and listen to music."	E_I0
"The park has altered considerably since then."	S_M2
"Now there is one large-ish rose garden, occupying the central area where the fountain stood, and with seats all around it."	B_S0
"One of the smaller rose gardens remains on the north side of the park."	I_S0
"The bandstand has also been replaced, by an amphitheatre for concerts and associated seating."	I_S0
"The glasshouse has gone and in its places is a water feature; similarly, where the pond for water plants stood there is now a children's play area with a cafe nearby."	I_S0
"Access to the park is still via the two original entrances, but there is now a third entrance near the water feature from an underground car park."	E_S0
"Despite the apparently significant changes, the park retains the basic elements of flowers, water, seating and music, with the addition of a cafe and a children’s play area."	S_C2
 
"Nowadays, Household waste recycling is indeed inadequate compared with other waste such as electronic products or paper."	S_I0
"But I do not agree that the govenment use legal to limit this phenomenon."	S_T0
"In  my opinion, the legal of recycling can act as a restraint and a deterrent to the vast majority of the population."	S_M1
"The government punishes the people who does not sort the garbage or throw the rubbish in wrong place."	B_S0
"Even sent the repeat offender to the prison."	I_S0
"Though it is foreseeable that the effect of recycling will improve dramatically in few weeks, the complaint from the public will also increase in the same trend like effect of recycling."	E_S0
"Facing with such a problem, I think there is a better way to solve that problem which called education."	S_M1
"By carrying out the activities in primary and secondary school, Students can learn relevant knowledge effectively and joyfully."	B_S0
"The idea of environmental protection will also be spread."	I_S0
"Although education can not change the phenomenon immediately, It is still a permanent solution for recycling problem."	I_S0
"In addition, Tighter constraints on vendors are another answer for that problem."	I_S0
"With the improving of processing and the materials, the product will become more environmentally friendly."	I_S0
"Better products allow people to achieve environmental protection without classification"	E_S0
"To sum up, perhaps making garbage classification into law may be one way, but education and technology are the effective ways to solve the problem."	B_C1
"Therfore, I do not suggest making garbage collection a law."	E_C1
 
"I think people today are  willing to help the struggling strangers."	S_T0
"In the past few years,there were some people pretended to fall down when a car sped by and then they claimed that the car kocked them down,and asking for compensate."	S_T1
"But when the divers call the police ,the police determined that the driver should pay for the both the costs of medical attention and the mental hurt."	B_S1
"And although the driver is unwilling to do this,he actually had to pay for this."	E_S1
"There are also some people who pretend to fall down,and when a university stuent come to help him, but he said that the student hit him,likewise,the poor student also need to pay for it."	B_M1
"Consequently,all the people in the cuontry said that thi kind of "reward" will be a disaster,becouse in this way people are not willing to help struggling strangers."	E_M1
"And it will also create a different world!"	B_S2
"So,the legisliture has to create a law to protect the people who are willing to help others,it says that the helpers need to take a photo before helping people ,and this photo will be used as a evidence to show that you are not the guy who nock him down."	E_S2
"And now the helpers can help people because of the new type of law."	B_C1
"so, as a result ,the people,who pretend to be hurt has now chance to ask for compensate,and there will be a lot of people ,again , who are willing to help others,and only in this way, this country,will be a well developed coutry wit a lot of warm-hearted people,and it be able to copete against other country,and it will finnaly be rew"	E_C1
 
"Will the development of touring do more goods than harms?"	B_S0
"People may argued about this."	I_S0
"As for me, it' s my opinion that if we are able to visit more places that were unknown for human beings,
there are certern to be more advantages to all of us."	I_S0
"For people  favor of  natural views, they may hold the view that when the remote natural  be easily arrived for human, it't will be a 
disaster for the local environment and wild animais there."	I_S0
"Plants will be cutted down to make room for all varities of  modern buildings."	I_S0
"People wil be attracked by the views, then, the views will be ruined by pollution."	I_S0
"However, will the remote natural environments free from destory without visit?"	I_S0
"The answer is no."	I_S0
"Many years ago, scientist had finded that pollution happend in  not only the areas people lived but also the places that nobody had came before."	I_S0
"Truth is that places on the earth are connected by all kinds of ways, like the move of water."	I_S0

"It has been noticed that lots of young students leave school with negative attitude to studying."	S_T0
"And there exist scores of factors causing this terrible problem."	B_S0
"Here come my opinions."	I_S0
"First,I think the main cause is the lack of the interest in studying."	I_S0
"It is widely acknowledged that if one is extremely interested in something,he will persue it heart and soul."	I_S0
"Taking an artist as an example."	I_S0
"Owing to their high-level interest in the art,they can try to think and create for the whole day without realizing exhaustation."	I_S0
"Thus,we know interest is vital to the students."	I_S0
"Second,the problem also has to be with the difficulties they encounter such as the critic from the teachers or the low marks,which do have profound and negative impact on the student's studying in the school,leading to the loss of confidence."	I_S0
"As we all know,only when someone have confidence in himself will he be willing to attempt."	I_S0
"And the critic and failure are what consume our confidence and stop us going ahead."	I_S0
"So,there must be some ways to solve the problem I have mentioned."	I_S0
"First,we should find the pleasure in the study such as the interaction with classmates and teachers when we learn new knowledge."	I_S0
"It can really develop one warm studying atmosphere which may inspire us to learn more."	I_S0
"Second,try to keep yourself calm in the class and when you are doing your homework."	I_S0
"If u do like these,your behaviour maybe more considerable."	I_S0
"This results to your accurate answers in your exams and homework."	I_S0
"Though the problem is disgusting and hard to handle,I do believe that if we can stick to doing as I have suggested,we will make great progress and have few negative thoughts on studying."	E_S0

"Thus medical care is very significant."	I_S0
"Additionally, a good medical system means that people can be more likely to survive from the disasters."	I_S0
"Promoting the medical environment and equipment in advance can save sources for the reason that when the medical emergency happens, if the medical system is poor and people connot be saved, the society would get into trouble and people live in panic."	I_S0
"At that time, the government would cost more money and manpower, for instance NCP."	E_S0

"Nowadays , with the fast develpoment of  the education about the society ."	S_I0
"The children depends on many factors ,including their families and some outside situations like the school education ,peers and so forth."	B_T0
"Personally , I agree that the family is less inluential than other aspects working together ,and my reasons will be wrote below."	E_T0
"On the one hand."	S_M1
"I strongly believe outside-of-home elements make greater contributions to the overall growth of children."	B_S0
"Firstly, in terms of academic education, teachers in school have priority over parents."	I_S0
"For example, compared with some parent who have low-level or even no education, teachers are professionally educated and trained in formal university, and well-experienced in teaching."	I_S0
"That is to say, school teachers are more advantageous and influential, in terms of comprehensively and accurately instructing, explaining and demonstrating common knowledge about laws of nature and universe, theories and formulas of math and physics, and events and people in history."	I_S0
"What is more, forming social skills also relies on a school environment where children have opportunities to communicate, play and argue with other peers."	I_S0
"This strong interpersonal interaction can make children proficient in real-world socialization."	E_S0
"On the other hand,the influence of family on children is very deep, because parents, primary teachers in the life of children, set the first role models for them to learn and imitate, and which would be logged into the impressionable childhood mind and determine basic behaviors and thinking of them."	S_M1
"For example, by observing and learning the daily activities of parents, like speaking, cooking and house cleaning, washing hands before eating, a child can master the language, self-care ability and hygienic habits."	B_S0
"Besides, parents also play a key role in developing the intelligence of children."	I_S0
"For instance, with day-to-day teaching, communication and storytelling, a parent can help a child to improve cognitive skills like basic mathematic calculation, memorizing, reading, and thinking and judging in a proper way."	E_S0
"In conclusion, when it comes to the importance in influencing children, other aspects like teachers in school and media override the parents, for the reasons that the formers have incomparable effects on the education, social skills and personalities of children."	S_C2
 
"There is heated debate over whether improving public health by doing sports facilities or other methods available."	B_T1
"Although sometime doing sports facilities indeed can strengthen public health, personally, I hold a view that not only dwellers could keep their health  via doing sports, but also keep health by eating less junk food or changing secondary lifestyles, especially those clerks."	E_T1
"This can consume spare calorie which they intake by doing exercises to keep healthy"	O
 
"People have different view about how government choose the direction of development ."	S_T1
"Some of them believe that the economic progress is the most essential."	B_S0
"In other areas is of the same importance as the economic development ."	I_S0
"To begin with , we need to realize the importance of educational progress."	I_S0
"With higher quality of education resources , school could identify and train students with great talent ."	I_S0
"Those well-educated workforce will definitetly bring benefit for long-term development  of a country ."	I_S0
"because they already have ability to think idependently."	I_S0
"Moreover, i find that development of technological innovations create labour-saving machinery which could increase the efficiency of manufacure ."	I_S0
"Workers will just use automate machines which could improve people's security by doing simple operation and would not feel energy-consuming ."	I_S0
"Additionally, the development of cociety also needs to ensure the progress of medical treatment."	I_S0
"Advanced medical system can guarantee people's mental and physical wellbebing ."	I_S0
"However, there still are two key reasons why economic growth are equally important  for country's development ."	I_S0
"Firsty, the development of local economy brings many job opportunities for public."	I_S0
"Those people who get work should pay taxes to government and it can increase authority's income and they could use those tax revenue to invest in different industry."	I_S0
"By this way, stable social development may provide people with higer quality of life and the crime rate of this city will also fall ,because people already have ability to feed themselves."	I_S0
"In conclusion, the economy is obviously play irreplaceble role in growth,but be progress in education,technology,enviroment and health care are equally significant."	E_S0
 
"The readig material and the lecture talk about sending humans to Mars."	S_I0
"The reading material believes that sending people to Mars will inevitably face some difficult problems, while the speaker in the lecture clearly does not agree with it."	S_T1
"To begin with, the speaker refutes the reading material by pointing out that there is a technique can let humans grow plants in water instead of soil, and it only need a small place."	S_M1
"So, these plants which grow in the Mars can produce fresh air and absorb carbon dioxide."	B_S1
"According to the reading material, the writer indicates that the round-ship to Mars and back is likely to take at least two years, so the cargo capacity of space will be a difficult problem to solve because it is too limited to put on board the food, water and oxygen which requied by humans for living in two yeas."

"In recent year, although agricultural technology develops better and better, most of people are still hungry all over the world."	S_T1

"Nowadays, human hope to conquer nature."	S_M1
"Therefore, they will be unscrupulous destruction of nature to achieve their own purposes."	B_S0
"For example, the rich want to escape the heat in summer and have a quiet place to live."	I_S0
"Maybe they will exploit the forest to build villas."	I_S0
"Forests are being stripped to make way for building."	I_S0
"In the long term, the deforestation process may put threat into yielding crops in a sustainable way."	I_S0
"As a result, their descendants living in the deserted area fail to seek available land resource to address hunger’s root causes."	I_S0
"If people continue to do this, our earth will be damaged seriously."	I_S0
"The frequency of natural disaster will increase sharply."	I_S0
"In this case, no matter how advanced our agricultural technology is, human can’t resist the revenge of nature."	E_S0
"To address these problems, all governments and international organizations should put their effort together."	S_M1
"For example, in china, government can encourage people to protect their environment in order to decrease the natural disaster."	B_S0
"In this way, crops will grow in a peaceful and comfortable places."	I_S0
"So , production will also be greatly increased."	I_S0
"What’s more."	I_S0
"People should develop a good habit which is to save food actively."	E_S0
"To sum up, if our ecological environment better and better, fewer and fewer people will be go hungry"	O
 
"Nowadays, more and more parents discuss about awarding child obtaining high grades with money."	B_I0
"There comes a very common phomenon that some parents argue about it while the others in favor of it ."	E_I0
"However, in my view, I agree with the former."	B_T0
"The reason are listed following."	E_T0
"Firstly, gaining high mark is a basic requirement for child."	S_M0
"Children are required to go to school and take class, A good grade just means that they do a great job in their study, In another words, it just prove that children have thier task done."	S_S2
"An vivid exmple is employee relation."	S_M0
"Picture these one day you told your boss that you did a good job to ask for bouns."	B_S0
"What is your boss's attitude?"	I_S0
"Futhermore, giving money to high grade kids might contribute to money abuse."	I_S0
"Children are on their way to learn a lot of things , including how to spend money."	I_S0
"In that time, given awarding high grade children with money, in addition , he doesn't master how to spend money."	I_S0
"He is more likely to buy luxury goods which may lead to credit card abuse in future."	E_S0
"Today's college student can prove this."	S_M0
"Many of them live in these condition , when they go to college and have their own credit card."	B_S1
"They custom many unaffordable things, like laptop, cell phone, camera etc."	E_S1
"Last but not least, providing award to high mark kids is not a bad choice, as it can situmate children to try their best."	S_M0
"But there are many others that can outweight money."	B_S1
"For instance, to go to the park or watch a movie is an alterative which can help them release and relax from the heavy study load."	E_S1
"All in all, awarding high grade kids with money is absoutely awful decision which is not resonable and can lead to bad behaviors."	B_C1

"Advertisement is a tool for companies to introduce their products on screens."	B_I0
"Recent year, the discussion about whether products in advertisements are the same with products in real life emerged because there are lots of problems on advertisements."	I_I0
"Some people say that they are the same regarding company must obey  laws from countries."	E_I0
"However, from my perspective, i consider that most advertisements make products much better than they really are because most of companies want to get more benefits by using better products and quality will lose if quantity are increasing."	S_T0
"First, some companies want to get more profits through incredible advertisement,while they don't have such good products at all."	S_M0
"For instance, McDonalds in China used to have a advertisement about their cabbages."	B_S0
"They claimed that all cabbages they used was imported from Australia."	I_S0
"As time passed by, lots of people doubted the reality because they considered cabbages in burgers had really strange smell."	I_S0
"After lots of investments, McDonalds' regulaters admitted that they didn't use cabbages from Australia and even use some rotten cabbages in China."	I_S0
"Similar example occured on companies about batteries."	I_S0
"they used magnificent advertisements treat consumers."	E_S0
"Moreover, quality will decrease as quantity increase, products in advertisements must be manufactured very carefully, nevertheless, in real life, there are lots of goods waiting to manufacture so quality have to decrease."	S_M0
"For example, Benz had a advertisement illustrating their cars."	B_S0
"In the advertisement, it claimed that they only consume 6.4L oil per 100km."	I_S0
"but actually, consumers stated that most of their cars need 8-10L oil per 100km."	I_S0
"But, they used all the same techniques in advertisements."	I_S0
"The points is that there are too many cars waiting to produce in one factary, so the quality can't be guranteed as good as in the advertisements."	E_S0
"It is plausible that most advertisements make products the same with they really are because of the law given by countries."	S_M0
"If they break the rules, they have to pay for it."	B_S0
"However, most companies use very smart way to avoid the punishment."	I_S0
"They always add some very little letters on the advertisements:"the real quality should relate to the real one." this sentence is really hard for us to see it, and they manage to avoid the punishment."	E_S0
"In conclusion, i suppose that most advertisements make products much better than they really are because they use this way to attract more consumers and quality must decrease as quantity increase."	S_C2
 
"Nowadays people pay spcial attention to chilren's education."	S_I0
"Some people think the famiy infuence is more important."	B_T0
"But other people think the social affect is more havey than the family."	I_T0
"In my opinon, the influence of family parents on children is more imprtant than the social."	E_T0
"Because the children stayed at home with family for the longest time when they were a child."	S_S2
"Some people think the social affect is more havey than the family."	S_M1
"To some extent, I also agree with this view."	B_S0
"For example, the child need go to school meet more strangers and make friends with them."	I_S0
"The strangers and friends are 
 the social influences can effect the child."	I_S0
"The infuence of society on chlidren is not only people."	I_S0

"Everyone lives in a language community."	S_I0
"With the disappearance of a small number of languages, some people don't take it seriously and  believe that the life would be easier."	B_T0
"I think the idea is unreasonable."	E_T0
"Admittedly, The presence of a small number of languages in the world will reduce communication and work pressure."	S_M0
"If working with the company requires negotiation with customers, only the most common languages in the world, such as English, Spanish and other languages which will increase the efficiency of work and cultural conflicts in negotiations."	B_S1
"However, this does not mean negating the cultural and scientific value of fewer languages."	E_S1
"On the level of the cultural value, fewer languages can lay a foundation of modern languages."	S_M0
"For example, the Oracle is the embryonic form of Chinese characters."	B_S0
"It has witnessed the historical evolution of Chinese characters and has had a far-reaching impact on the current Chinese characters."	I_S0
"Therefore, each language has its own cultural value, even if only a minority of languages have disappeared."	E_S0
"On the level of the scientific value, fewer languages can provide large amounts of data for scientific research."	S_M0
"For example, the language of some tribes will promote scientific research on population, history and environment so that people and the world can be more fully understood."	B_S0
"Based on language, science can be further studied."	I_S0
"Thus, do not underestimate the importance of  fewer languages."	E_S0
"To sum up, a few languages are very precious to us, especially those that are about to disappear."	S_C2
 
"As my point view, I think have more TV channels is not too bad, people would have more choices."	S_T1
"However, I think that we have better to have a few TV channels,which have a quality of TV programs that can make people."	B_S0
"To begin with, if  a few TV channels have quality programmes, it can concentrate on providing high visual effect, people would enjoy their life when they are tired."	I_S0
"They can have a rest time in this time."	I_S0
"On the other hand, high programmes can be calm emotions, can relax the brain can adjust physcially and mentally."	I_S0

"The last but not the least, we can from the TV show, know more about the interesting things."	I_S0
"it's just close to the real life around us."	I_S0
"We can know more about the world, we could know more what was happened in some stars that we like."	I_S0
"In summary, the world is develop in every single day, we should have more rest time which made us relax, have a good relationship with our family,and watch more interesting things can made us fun."	I_S0
"I think that having a quality TV programs is much better than have more TV channels but is not good."	E_S0
 
"Whether the museums should charge for admission or not has arouse a heated discussion and great concern."	S_T1
"Some citizens hold the view that the  advantages of charging people for admission to museums precede the disadvantages while others insist the opposite ideas."	S_S2
 
"Many people today like to fast-food restaurants,because of  the fast pace of life and hard working hours."	B_I0
"Fast food has posed a threat  to traditional cuisine in many cultures,and people should solve the problems that may arise from this change."	E_I0

"Another problem is that it can affect people is ways of life,including eating habits."	S_M1
"At present,most of fast food provide American and European food ,including hamburgers,fried chicken and pizzas."	B_S1
"People is eating increasingly monotonous,and some traditional may be vanished."	E_S1

"In today's world, learning foreign languages has become a popular behavior."	B_I0
"We learn a foreign language for many reasons."	I_I0
"It is believed by someone that learning a foreign language is just for traveling or working abroad."	E_I0
"While others believe that learning a foreign language is not merely for this reason, but also for many other reasons."	S_T0
"Considering the rapid development of tourism, the continuous popularization of tourism culture, and the fact that the living concept or salary in foreign countries are more in line with the expectations of some people in China, it must be admitted that the main purpose of learning a foreign language is to go abroad, to travel or work or communicate with others, as well as other social activities."	S_M2
"But we can never learn a foreign language just for going abroad."	B_S0
"In fact, there are many other reasons why we learn a foreign language."	I_S0
"To start with, learning a foreign language can broaden our horizons."	I_S0
"Foreign culture has everlasting charm, but one of the obstacles to understanding foreign culture is the language barrier."	I_S0

"If we fail to master a foreign language, we may encounter obstacles in our communication with them."	E_S0
"To sum up, there are many reasons to learn a foreign language, but we cannot take traveling abroad or working abroad as the only reason to learn a foreign language."	B_C1
"We should also pay attention to other reasons and let them become the motivation for our foreign language learning."	E_C1
 
"Some families have a sort of rule betweeen parents and children that parents will award childen with money gor their high grade in school."	B_I0
"Many people especially some students support this idea."	E_I0
"However, some others doubt that this rule will not bring positive effects to children."	B_T0
"On a personal note, I also hold an opposite opinion towards such phenomenon."	E_T0
"Firstly, it might lead to the children considering it natural to ask for money for their every efforts, which is a fault recognition."	S_M1
"Parents' rewarding method directly links students grade with money, which is a very negative indication."	B_S0
"It does have effects to some extent on encouraging children to study hard, but neglects the real purpose of getting more knowledge."	I_S0
"As a result, children will have a tendency to ask for money for everything they do though some are their duties."	I_S0
"A recent research conducted by New York University shows that eight-five percent of students who used to be rewarded by parents with money take studing as a way of earning more, and tend to take it for granted for asking for money as repayment when they complete some tasks."	E_S0
"Secondly, it is also harmful to the healthy development of children's personality and life values."	S_M1
"Awarding children with money makes it too earlyfor the rules in adults' world to enter children's lives."	B_S0
"They realize the rule of exchanging and will try to imitate."	I_S0
"Generally they will have the tendency to asking for pay for every effort they give."	I_S0
"They have a higher possiblity of becoming selfish and worshiping profits in the future."	I_S0

"One of my classments was used to being awarded often by his mother."	I_S0
"He have a habit of asking for pay for every effort or piece of information he gives, even if he was communicating with his classmates."	I_S0
"No one liked to stay with him."	E_S0
"Thirdly, it can make the family relationship quite distant."	B_C0
"As the way of awarding is directly connected with money, which make family relationship generally become utilitarian."	I_C0

"Some people adovate that govenment should cover the public health and education but the other people suppse that this is not the obiligation of government."	S_T1
"The essence of government pay for citizen is a kind of insurance and it is benefit to all people."	S_M1
"Insurance mean when the disaster occur on one people, all people that pay for the insurance undertake this disaster together whatever the disaster is illness or bankrupt."	B_S0
"Government collect tax and provide insurance for us."	I_S0
"like if one day my parents go bankrupt, before they find a new job and settle down again they do not need to concern about my stduy and my life will not change a lot because of the unemployment of my parents, the same as the illness."	I_S0
"But when the disaster happen on the others the cost of my family is insignificant."	E_S0
"The family konw their circumstance instand of government."	S_M1
"And the bill of hospital and school for government will increase burden  and propel government to raise the tax and this burden will back to citizen in the end."	B_S1
"So if government do not pay for health care and education mean a family have more money to allocate by themselves and their decision are likely to better than the decision that goverment make for them."	E_S1
"To summarise, if government pay for the public health care and education, several family may well survive after the disaster but for most family, their dispolsable income is decrease."	B_C1
"If  government do not pay for health care and education, some family will collapse in the accident, but most family got a higher disposalable income."	E_C1
 
"The bar chart below illustrates the presentage of males and females distribute in five different levels of post-school qualificantions in Australia in 1999."	S_I0
"It was noticeable that males outnumbered famels in skilled vocational diploma and higher educational dilpomas."	S_M1
"Men constituted a large proportion of skilled vocational diploma,which is nine times as large as that of women(90% vs 10%).70% postgraduate diploma belonged to males and only halve belonged to females."	B_S1
"There was a similar proportion ditribution can be found in master's degree."	E_S1
"By contrast,females account for a lager precentage in undergraduate diploma and bachelor's degree."	S_M1
"There was about 70% of women who got undergraduate deploma while the porportion of men only constitute 40%."	B_S1
"Bacherlors's degree was suitable for both gender to get for the reason that the proportion of them distributed almost equally to 48% for males and 52% for females."	E_S1
"Overall,it is clear that males constitute more porportion in all the post-school qualifications than females did and this phenomenon can be found noticeablely in the proportion of skilled vocational diploma."	S_C2
 
"I think that going to a country that speas a foreign language does not cause serious social problems."	S_T1
"Though there are differences in cultures and customs between countries,as long as we work hard to adapt to the environment,we can integrate into the social life of a foreign-speaking country as soon as possible."	B_S0
"And language is just a tool for communication,the real communication between people is the communication of heart."	I_S0
"I think everyone's ability to adapt to different environment is very strong."	I_S0
"As far as  I know,when a student decide to go to another country where he needs to speak a foreign language,he will prepare in advance for all aspects,such as language,customs and so on."	I_S0
"These all help him adapt to a new   environment faster."	I_S0
"Last year,Iwent to South Korea to travel,though I only talked a little bit of Korean,I found that people there were very warm and friendly ,and they would like to help me solve various problems."	I_S0
"I did not feel uncomfortable because I was in a foreign-speaking country,on the contrary,I am relaxed in my trip."	I_S0
"I think most people are kind,they will offer help to us when we really in need,but,we still need to be independent,because sometimeswho can help us are only ourselves.,we should develop ourselves to adapt to the new environment better."	I_S0
"I believe that as long as we are prepared before departure,we will be able to adapt to athe new environment as soon as possible."	E_S0
 
"Some people believe that technological developments lead to the loss of traditional cultures."	S_I0
"While this may be true in the case of some societies, others seem to be unaffected by technology and the modern world."	S_T0
"On the one hand, the advances in technology that have driven industrialisation in developed countries have certainly contributed to the disappearance of traditional ways of life."	S_M1
"For example, in pre-industrial Britain, generations of families grew up in the same small village communities."	B_S0
"These communities had a strong sense of identity, due to their shared customs and beliefs."	I_S0
"However, developments in transport, communications and manufacturing led to the dispersal of families and village communities as people moved to the cities in search of work."	I_S0
"Nowadays most British villages are inhabited by commuters, many of whom do not know their closest neighbours."	E_S0
"On the other hand, in some parts of the world traditional cultures still thrive."	S_M1
"There are tribes in the Amazon Rainforest, for example, that have been completely untouched by the technological developments of the developed world."	B_S0
"These tribal communities continue to hunt and gather food from the forest, and traditional skills are passed on to children by parents and elders."	I_S0
"Other traditional cultures, such as farming communities in parts of Africa, are embracing communications technologies."	I_S0
"Mobile phones give farmers access to information, from weather predictions to market prices, which helps them to prosper and therefore supports their culture."	E_S0
"In conclusion, many traditional ways of life have been lost as a result of advances in technology, but other traditional communities have survived and even flourished."	S_C2

"when it comes to the issue of where should high school teachers spend most of their class time, it always provokes lively discussion among parents and students."	S_I0
"In my opinion I think both of them are effective for students' learning because of some reasons."	S_T0
"First of all, some high school teachers spend most of the class time lecturing while the students listen and take notes, this way can help students to master new knowledge easier and lay a better foundation."	S_M1
"For students who enter high school, some knowledge is very difficult, so it will take lots of time and energy ti digest them."	B_S0
"So this way is a effective way to improve students strength, actually, it is good for their future."	I_S0
"To be more specific, my brother Jin, when he was a high school students, he had a very strict teacher that always give a long explanations of knowledge points inclass and urges students to take notes,to listen carefully."	I_S0
"Also, my brother's classmates complained about the boring way  of learning, but they had to say this way made many their grades greatly improved and their foundation is much stronder than before, they went from being the worst class in the grade to the best class."	I_S0
"So I should admit this way is very effective."	E_S0
"Second, we know that some high school teachers spend most of the class time on discussion and projects that students are highly involved in and exchanged their ideas."	S_M1
"I think it is also a very effective way tp learn."	B_S0
"Because this way can stimulate students ' creativity, and teach them the ability of think for themselvs."	I_S0
"Therefore, early cultivation of their ability can also help them cope with problems in the future."	I_S0
"For example, like my sister, she is a creative scientist."	I_S0
"Whenever she recalled her time in high school, she told me that  she wanted to say thank you to his high school class teacher, she's teacher is a very humorous and creative person, she spent time of the class and gave students time to discuss &exchange their ideas."	I_S0
""Maybe sometimes to come up with a idea is very difficult, even so I still hope everyone can use your brain to think about something, even if it's not a good idea".this sentences is always uttered by my sister teacher."	I_S0
"students are becoming more and more thoughtful and interested in learning."	I_S0
"After my sister and her classmates graduated, they all had enter a good universities and good companies because they have a same point: they were very thoughtful."	E_S0
"That is why I think both of two ways are all effective for student's learning."	S_C2
 
"These recent years, travel becomes a fine way for people to relax in their free time."	B_I0
"There are some ways to travel like participating a group travel that lead by a guide and free travel all alone."	E_I0
"In my opinion, traveling in a group led by a tour guide is indeed a better way but travel alone is still a good way."	S_T0
"First, travel in a group and have a tour guide can make the trip more convenient."	S_M1
"When people is taking a trip, they have to plan a route and there are many details like where to have a lunch or which hotel I am staying at."	B_S0
"If there is an group, typically they will plan these things for you before the traveling started, this will save much time."	I_S0
"Also, tour guide is professional so the arrangements of the tour guide will be more careful, if there are any problems, they will help."	E_S0
"Secondly, when you are traveling with a group, you might make friends with them."	S_M1
"The significant is that the people travel with you are more likely living in conditions are similar to you, you might make some like-minded friends on the trip because they travel for a similar reason to why you're traveling."	B_S1
"The great point of that is people will feel more pleasing when they stay with the people have common language."	E_S1
"Admittedly, group travel is great but there is other positivity of traveling alone."	S_C2
"The main advantage is that people can plan freely, I did mention that making a plan by the tour guide is efficient but the key advantage of making free plan is the flexibility of the plan."	S_S2

"The chart illustrates the trends of average carbon dioxide emissions per person of four countries between 1967 and 2007."	S_I0
"It is legible that the number of average carbon dioxide emissions per person in Italy and Portugal kept increasing during the period of 1967 to 2007."	B_T1
"Statistics of Italy started with approximately 4 tonnes per person in 1967 and reached almost 8 tonnes per person in 2007 while that of Portugal began with about 1 tonnes per person in 1967 and ended up with 5 tonnes per person in 2007."	E_T1
"There are two countries having declined tendencies of this data."	S_M2
"There are statistics in United Kingdom and Sweden,with 11 tonnes and 9 tonnes per person in 1967,respectively."	B_S0
"Though being declined,the number of average carbon dioxide emissions per person of United Kingdom was always the highest among the four countries."	I_S0
"And those data decreased to 9 tonnes and 5 tonnes respectively in 2007."	I_S0
"Interestingly, there was a peak of the amount of average carbon dioxide emissions per person of Sweden in 1977."	E_S0
 
"The charts interprets the proportion of water used in three different sectors in six regions over the globe."	S_T1
"For industrial use, Europe took first with 53% of total usage, followed by North America (48%)."	B_S0
"The percentage of water used for industry in South East Asia and South America were similar, with 10% and 12% respectively."	I_S0
"There was 7% of water used in Africa is for industrial use, but it was still more than the proportion of industry-used water in central Asia, which was 5%, lying last."	I_S0
"In agricultural term, the largest proportion of water used belongs to Central Asia, which used 84%."	I_S0
"Africa and Southeast Asia also sacrificed the dominant part of their water for agricultural, using 84% and 81% respectively."	I_S0
"The smallest percentage of this category was that in Europe, with only 32% of water used for agriculture."	I_S0
"For dometstic consumption, all the continents spent the smallest proportion of water on it, except South America which spent 19%, taking firat in this category."	I_S0
"Europe domestic water use was slightly smaller than South American one, with 15% of total."	I_S0
"There were the same percentage of water for domestic use in central Asia and south east Asia, with 7% respectively, and taking the last at the same time."	I_S0

"The recycling of waste is an important thing for proctecting environment."	S_I0
"In my opinion, it is imperative for human to set laws about recycling now."	B_T0
"The reasons are as follows."	I_T0
"The wastes are harmful for the environment."	E_T0
"For example, the waste plastic bags."	B_S0
"The waste bags  buried in the soil can cause the worsen of soil quality and the underwater also can be affected."	I_S0
"If the waste bags flutter into the sea, the lives of marine organism can be threated."	I_S0
"The bags may congest the weasand of animals and destory the special growing envirinment of plants like coral."	E_S0
"Therefore, it is important to recycle the waste as more as possible."	S_M1
"The recycling of waste can not only reduce the bad effect to environment, but also increase the resources people needed."	B_S0
"Such as, the reusing of metal, glasses and paper."	I_S0
"These materials can be reused and reduce the requirement of raw material."	E_S0
"During the process of recycling, the law plays an important part."	S_M1
"Laws can encourage and supervise people to recycle the waste."	B_S0
"Take city Shanghai for an example, a law from last year saied that the waste is required to be classified before throwing them."	I_S0
"Then, people start to know about the waste and spend several days to learrn classifying."	I_S0
"However, in other cities, people still mix the waste and know less about the waste."	I_S0
"Thus it can be seen that the laws can encourage people to recycle the waste."	I_S0
"If there are no laws, most people will not care about that."	E_S0
"In conclusion, it is imperative for human to set laws about recycling now."	S_C2
 
"With the continuous improvement of medical conditions in the modern world, people's life expectancy and actual life expectancy have been significantly improved."	S_T1
"The advantages and disadvantages of this phenomenon need to be explored."	B_S0
"One of the main advantages of longevity is that it can meet the basic needs of human beings."	I_S0
"When life expectancy increases, people naturally feel happy and hopeful, because they will be able to enjoy more life."	I_S0
"This kind of happiness may bring benefits to society, because it creates an enhanced spiritual environment, which leads to social stability and productivity efficiency."	I_S0
"Here, the psychological impact of the long-lived is crucial."	I_S0
"However, the disadvantages of such development should not be ignored."	I_S0
"On the one hand, although life expectancy is increased, its quality may be reduced, especially in the elderly group."	I_S0
"The elderly suffer from a series of diseases, most of which are incurable but not fatal due to advanced medical care."	I_S0
"These diseases are often disturbing and persistent, and unfortunately painful."	I_S0
"On the other hand, longer life expectancy has increased the increasing population pressure and caused a series of problems related to the world economy and resources."	I_S0
"This situation is already very serious in countries such as Germany and Japan, where the elderly account for a large proportion of the population."	I_S0
"In my opinion, as long as modern medicine can guarantee the quality of life, the advantages of this development will not be offset by its disadvantages."	I_S0
"As for the problems related to population pressure, the development of productivity may overcome these problems, and the development of productivity is usually closely related to the improvement of medical level."	E_S0
 
"People often say that right and wrong are things for a lifetime,but I think it's just a moment."	B_S0
"I've heard such a story,a child threw the paper bag of sugar into the trash can,although it seems to be far away from him,but he did,and hurriedly walked to his mother side,smiled,his mother also seems very happy."	I_S0
"Of course,a child's right and wrong is the concern of his mother,which seems to test the child's choice:Choose the right,will always do so,because he feels that the mistake will makes him blame himself,or choose the wrong side,that is from childhood,even if he feels that it is wrong and change his mind,but that choice or the first choice in his heart is not erased."	E_S0
"There are many things around us,things are two sides,but the difference is how we choose."	S_M2
"In the face of both the two sides,we should look at the problem from different angles."	B_S0
"So don't always dwell on mistakes,no one has not made mistakes,the important thing is to be able to bow in front of mistakes,admit that they are wrong,to understand that there is always a right truth behind mistakes."	I_S0
"With the mistakes of the beginning, there is the right in the end."	I_S0
"But if the child does something wrong,proper punishment is also necessary to help them correct it so as not to make a big mistake later,but don't over-penalize."	I_S0
"Over-penalty can be counter-intuitive,ineffective,or even worse."	E_S0
 
"Now many young students leaving schools with negative thoughts on studying may be a big problem in the society."	S_T1
"From what I knew,this phenomenon may because of these reasons."	B_S0
"Not having enough interest in studying may be the main reason."	I_S0
"One of my classmates in high school once told me that she didn't want to continuing studying,due to the boring and hard courses,she lost the enthusiasms."	I_S0
"Also,unsatisfied scores let those students feel down about the study."	I_S0
"It is believed that no pain,no gain,But not all the students get the deserve."	I_S0
"Sometimes efforts could not recieve the equal results."	I_S0
"What I have mentioned above can explain the problem."	I_S0
"And how to change the situation ia also a big deal for us."	I_S0
"From my classmate's experience,I think it is important to get back the inerest in studying,and that needs parents' and teachers' help."	I_S0
"Parents play a role character in child's life,family factor effect deeply to people's life."	I_S0
"The circumustance in home can influence the efficiency of studing."	I_S0
"For school,it is vital important to set attractive lessons to appeal students,and teacher should learn how to observe every student's studying conditon,to change the teaching level in time."	I_S0
"As a major task for the majority teenagers,studying is an indispensable part of life."	I_S0
"Especially when we are young,we can learn much more than we can when we are older."	I_S0

"So please catch every second in life and cherish the young age!"	E_S0
 
"Nowadays, more and more technologies are used to monitor people's behaviors (for example, through mobile tracking and security cameras)."	S_T1
"But in some cases, the person being monitored doesn't know it's true."	S_T0
"In my opinion,  this development outweigh disadvantages are outweigh advantage."	S_T1
"One of the disadvantages of people's privacy will be exposed and unsafe."	S_M0
"Because many people have important documents and files."	B_S0
"If there is an emergency that leads to the loss of important content, the documents and files as people's privacy should not be monitored, because privacy is an important content of a person that should not be known by too many people, which will have a great impact on life."	I_S0
"For example, in our phone have some secret like file photo phone number."	I_S0
"Everyone need to protect ourselves."	E_S0
"On the other hand, people under surveillance have a bad influence on people's lives."	S_M0
"If people encounter problems in the future and are taken out by bad people, it will have a great impact on people and make people feel that they have nothing to hide."	B_S1
"People are going to be very restrained."	E_S1
"Technology monitor have advantage ,it can help people to solve some traffic accident and some thief."	S_M0
"Monitor sometimes can protect our lives."	B_S0
"But our country is going to better and better with the continuous development of our country and the improvement of people's quality, this situation rarely occurs."	I_S0
"We should believe that people will not steal as before."	E_S0
"In conclusion, I think everyone need their own privacy and learn to protect ourselves."	B_C1
"Everyone should not let people know without privacy."	E_C1
 
"Over  recent years ,it has been an increasingly widespread trend that citizens are becoming heavier and less fit and healthy as the result of eating a large amount of fast food ,some individuals believe that  goverment should raise taxes on junk food,and i do agree."	S_T1
"One possible reason to support my view is that  most of fast food contain much fat, sugar and salt make our body fat and damage our teeth."	B_S0
"In the fast paced society,people spend more time on work, which might result in a poor diet."	I_S0
"People  perfer to eat fast food which have higher calories than they need and they teend to become overweight."	I_S0
"Body with a lot of fat impact their health."	I_S0
"An althernative reason is that the growing popularity of fast foods, directly and indirectly, impact the protection of traditional foods culture."	I_S0
"it is generally acknowledged that the culture of foods is an indispensable part of traditional culture ,which reflects the unique character of a nation."	I_S0
"if local people prefer to eat fast foods rather than cook traditional foods ,the recipes of traditional foods will gradually disappear."	I_S0
"Consequently, local citizens might lose a sence of culture idetity."	I_S0
"in spite of the discussion above, the econormic development which due to the fast foods cannot be ignore."	I_S0
"the fast foods industries bring lots of jobs for the residens and a"	E_S0
 
"I think senior management positions have much higher salaries than other worker in same company or organisation."	S_T1
"For example,Ma Yun,a famous businessman,he tries his best to earn money and become a senior management."	B_S0
"Now he have a lot of maney, he can do something what he likes."	I_S0
"So i think it is a good thing for those in senior management positions to have much"	E_S0
 
"It is well-known that a company or organisation is constitude from lots of people,those people has different work abilities,they come from different places and has different education backgrounds."	S_T1
"Of course I agree that people in senior management positions to have much higher salaries than other worker in the same company or organisation,and lots of reasons can be showed."	B_S0
"At first,people who in senior management positions has high acamedic diplomas and better education background,maybe they learn and experience much more than other workers."	I_S0
"Secondly,they do much more brain-works than other workers,as to complete the arrangement,to write some official documents or something others."	I_S0
"Thirdly,people do manage works shouled be good at organization,that the workers will obey him/her and work effectively."	I_S0
"Also they shouled have abilities of communication."	I_S0
"While they are at works,they must have to get the targets and manage their work,that they can tell the workers what to do and how to do in the next."	I_S0
"And of couse they shouled have abilities of management,after that they can be  good leaders in the company or  ogranisation."	I_S0
"It is obviousely that a manager shouled have lots of abilities than we have imaged,include high IQ and EQ."	I_S0
"They deserve high salaries."	I_S0
"In other way,they can encourage other workers to work harder to get higher salaries."	I_S0
"During my experience,there must be a leader or a manager in the group work or organisation."	I_S0
"Some years ago I attended a group to protect our environment aroud our high school,our leader told us what to do first and how to finish the work."	I_S0

"Recent years, there have been a heated debate on whether working for different organizations is proper."	B_S0
"It is tough for people to decide because of the unpredictable future."	I_S0
"There are several merits of changing working organizations."	I_S0
"Most importantly"	E_S0
"However,  from my perspective, the advantages of remain in the same organization all the working life overweigh the drawbacks."	S_M2
"First and foremost, we have a higher chance to achieve our goals by devoting ourselves to the work we choose."	B_S0
"It is universally recognized that being absorbed in one thing makes us succeed."	I_S0
"Furthermore, we are able to have access to deeper and more professional knowledge if we spend several decades on studying one thing continuously, in which case we might manage to become professionals in our own field."	E_S0
 
"I agree this point because this can make them grow fast ."	S_T0
"Children are ofe scolded by their parents when they make mistakes ."	S_T1
"however i do believe parents should sometimes allow children to make and learn from theirown mistakes ."	S_T0
"What children learn from their mistakes is likely to be impressive to them."	B_S0
"Mistakes can serve as valuable lesssons ,when children experience the consquence of their mistakes ,they will realize how their poor decision or actions will lead to unpleasant things ."	I_S0
"Compared with the advice and instructions of parents,such as experiences are more likely to leave a lasting impression on children."	I_S0
"Consequently ,they will learn to take a second thought in order not to make the same mistakes ,if they face the same situation again."	E_S0
"I think parents should allow thire children to make and learn from their mistakes as it can prove to be lessons more impressive an dis beneficialto psychological health of the children."	S_M2

"They don't think learning is a good thing."	S_T1
"On the other side,they really hate reading text book."	B_S0
"The first reason I think they have wrong attitude to studying is that their parients give them too much pressure."	I_S0
"Every parents want their children to be the best."	I_S0
"But school is a pyramid,most students do not have the abilitity to get the top."	I_S0
"So they become nagative with their grades."	I_S0
"Secondly, students think they have spent enough time on studying."	I_S0
"They should have a rest."	I_S0
"These students are getting away from the pressure of studying so that they do not want to study any more."	I_S0
"Many of my classmates aggree with this view."	I_S0
"Thirdly,some students think what they learn do not make sense because they bcan not use these knowledge in their daily life."	I_S0
"So they are forced to learn in the school and play or work when they  are leaving school."	I_S0
"This also make some young people working at a early age."	I_S0
"To improve the situation,I have 3 methods."	I_S0
"First,parents should encourage thei children."	I_S0
"Do not give pressure but help them correct the error."	I_S0
"Do not ask for an impossible goal but make a realistic target."	I_S0
"Second,school should emphasize the importance of studying."	I_S0
"School can hold lectures about how to learn,invite some famous people to talk about their studying lives."	I_S0
"Third,the goverment or school should develop an organization which can help students to apply their knowledge."	I_S0
"There are many vocational guidance in our university now,but they just provide a place for the graduated and enterprise but not give useful advice."	I_S0
"So it is necessary to apply what one has learnt."	E_S0

"There is no doubt that we are faced with more and more choices, as well as more and more problems."	S_S2
 
"Nowadays, governments and citizens may hold separate opinions in developing their countries."	S_T1
"A number of governments view the development of economy as their goal."	B_S0
"Admittedly, the economy is a vital key to develop a country."	I_S0
"With sufficient budget, country planners are able to invest more money in building various kinds of infrastructures."	I_S0
"For instance, investment in road, railway, public transportation can make lives of citizens much easier, and their satisfaction may also increase."	I_S0
"Besides, with the progress of economy, people's income will also rise."	I_S0
"Therefore, citizens can spend more money on purchasing daily goods."	I_S0
"Thus, the living standard of citizens will increase at the same time."	I_S0
"On the other hand, some people suppose developing other areas progress is equivalent to developing economy."	I_S0
"Personally, I tend to agree with this view rather than the previous one."	I_S0
"Apart from economy progress, governments should also focus on promoting education."	I_S0
"With a complete educational system, more talents of different areas may emerge."	I_S0
"Those talents are useful tools in helping develop their countries more efficiently."	I_S0
"In addition, governments should care about the environment."	I_S0

"It is undeniable that population growth is a serious problem in society and gradually becoming a global situation."	S_I0
"I will discuss the reasons and analyse this phenomenon as follow."	B_T1
"The increasing population can be caused by many factor."	I_T1
"Firstly, due to the development of science and technology, medical technology has become more and more advanced."	E_T1
"Through the research of scientists, they discovered many effective ways to treat diseases."	B_S0
"Many deadly diseases are not as powerful as before."	I_S0
"Thereby, the number of deaths who suffered illness falls."	I_S0
"Additionally, in order to adjust the age ratio of the population, many countries have promulgated policies to promote fertility, which has led many families to start having children."	I_S0
"Nowadays, the phenomenon of having a second child is widespread, so this makes the number of children increase rapidly, and eventually causes population growth
　　Some people may not agree with this statement."	I_S0
"They think that this is not a difficult problem."	I_S0
"Besides, there are many very serious problems, such as energy crisis, climate change,etc."	I_S0
"However, tracing back to the source, the root is because the uncontrolled growth of the population led to the massive consumption of resources, which ultimately caused a series of problems."	I_S0
"The massive exploitation and use of resources by humans has led to a lack of resources, other animals' living environments being occupied, and strange climate changing."	E_S0
"To summarize, there are many problems will caused by booming of population and the government has a range of responsibilities for tacking this issue."	S_S2
 
"Information sharing plays a pretty big role in our modern society which consists of high-tech,electronic products and all kings of unbelievable inventions."	B_I0
"Shared information makes people who can not afford to do reseaches easier to collect data then analyse it."	E_I0
"If there are enough people are willing to pulish their articles to the website,those poor scholars such as postgraduates or graduaters will get available resources instead of giving up due to financial problems."	S_T1
"Also,infomation sharing brings most advanced and valuable resources to the people nationwide ,so they can avoid wasting unnecessary time to struggling for other difficult aspects."	S_M1
"Coronavirus is the best example of this ,if China refused to let the resources to be public to the world ,other countries will be hard to get on it even spending extra energy and time to conduct reseaches."	S_S2
"Howerver,people should be given enough reward or paid after sharing valuable data or knowledge in case what they created  are copied or dispersed uncorrectly."	S_M1

"So a energy-saving behaviour will reduce energy consumption ."	I_S0
"For instance , people who transform their rletrical equipments into enegry-efficient facilities tend to consume fewer and fewer power source ."	I_S0

"Fristly,spend one year traveling can bordan our eyesight."	B_S0
"We can experience the diffirent culture and custome in diffrent places and learn the knowleadge that we will never learn in our classroom."	I_S0
"Secondly,spend one year going out can let us meet more people."	I_S0
"We can make friends with them and get to know the diffirent ways of living our lifes."	I_S0
"Lastly,spending one year going to work can let us understand the hardship of making money,which will let us know that we should not use our parents money easily,like it can be easily maken."	I_S0
"However,every coin has two sides,taking one year off also has many disadvantages."	I_S0
"Firstly,we now don't have many money on our own but it surely takes lots of money to go sightseeing or something else."	I_S0
"Acturly,it is not fair for our parents to spend so much money to support us to go around."	I_S0
"Secondly,as we are the graduated high school students,it is not very easy for us to find thouse high paid jobs,generally speaking,the jobs we can find in the gap year are waiter or ticket-seller or door-keeper,which,can be done by anybody who even didn't finish his or hers middle school study."	I_S0
"Plus,if we decided to take one year off,we have to face the truth that it may be hard for us to restart the study model as we have gone too far from classroom,test and so on."	I_S0
"So it may takes more time for us to study the knowledge from school and we may fall behind from our classmates."	I_S0
"Frankly speaking,every vhoice is okay."	I_S0
"No matter we choose to take one year off or not,we all have to face the difficulties in our life as well as the unexpecting surprise."	I_S0

"Accordingly,they insist the sport salaries is reletively too large and this phenomenom may cause the society focus too much on sports but ignore other essencial vocations."	E_S0
"Those who are convinced that the sport professionals deserve the super salary might argue that they are suffering a huge pressure from both society and themselves."	S_M0
"As a sportman,occupying by the fierce compititions,which are necessary and consistant,they have to live under strongly pressured situation ."	B_S0
"At the same time,the media and public’s focus on them make they have little privacy out of spotlight."	I_S0

"Nowadays, there is a popular awarding policy among parents and their school-age children, which is the kids can get awarding money for each high grade they get in school."	B_I0
"Different people hold different opinions on it."	E_I0
"Some people think it's good for motivation, but some think it does harm to children's growth because they are actually supressed to study hard, which is not voluntarily."	S_T0
"As for me, I think it will be a great idea only if parents run the awarding system in the right way."	S_T1
"On the one hand, children will become more hard-working if they know they can get some awards as soon as they get good grades in schools."	S_M1
"It is common that there is always something which kids want to buy but can't realize because of the lack of pocket money."	B_S0
"Therefore, the excess awarding money will become a great motivation for them."	I_S0
"They are more willing to concentrate on the class and finish the homework on time to get the better grades, and then to buy their dream present by their own."	E_S0
"On the other hand, to some extent, this kind of awarding policy will give the kids some wrong assumptions about studying because it seems as they are just studying for money and for their favorate gifts."	S_M1
"Therefore, it is not difficult to image that once they get enough pocket money to buy all the things they want, they will stop studying hard then."	B_S0
"That's why choosing a right way to offer award money is so crucial."	I_S0
"As far as I am concerned, parents should set a serious of detailed standards to make the awarding system more realizable."	I_S0
"More imporotant, the system should be based on the progress their kids make compared to the formal semester rather than the certain grades they get in the current semester."	I_S0
"For example, it will be more wisdom in this: one dollar for every five more scores you get compares to the last examination."	I_S0
"This kind of standard can always provide the children best motivations and keep them concentrate on studying all the time."	E_S0
"In short, there is no doubt that offering school-age children money for each high grade they get in school is a good way to motivate kids."	B_C1

"It is quite common these days for children learning a foreign language at a very young age."	S_I0
"While there are some negative  effects, I believe that the benefits are more significant."	S_T0
"On the one hand, it is true that if kids learn a foreign language at primary school will bring some disadvantages for children."	S_M1
"One significant reason is that they maybe fell stressful so that they would be nerves and have no childhood like others who learn it at secondary school."	B_S0
"However, I believe that today's effort can pave the way for better life."	I_S0
"The other reason is that if kids don't really want to learn it at this age, kids perhaps will tired of this subject."	I_S0
"But I think if using some interesting methods to teach them, they will love it."	E_S0
"However, I would argue that learning a foreign language at their primary  school is a reasonable thing."	S_M1
"One significant reason is that this is the beat age to remember."	B_S0
"They can study better when they get older."	I_S0
"Another reason is that a different language is important."	I_S0
"They learn it earlier, they can use it earlier."	I_S0
"In addition, they can use this language to travel the USA, the UK, France and so on."	I_S0
"A person who know a foreign language will not get lost and have a fascinating holiday."	I_S0
"They can appreciate the local customs of different places, which is benefit for their growing."	E_S0
"In conclusion, although there are some negative effects, I believe that it is better for kids to begin learning a foreign language at primary school."	S_C2
 
"In the recent days, students are getting more and more group works."	B_I0
"These works are meant to improve their collaboration and sense of obligation."	I_I0
"But now there is a question lying in front of us."	I_I0
"Do the group works actually increase the effectiveness of the projects?"	E_I0
"As far as I am concerned, I disagree the point that the group works will help to increase the effectiveness of the students than individual projects."	S_T1
"First, the increasing number of people will bring more discoordinance."	S_M0
"As all we know, every individual has their own different points of views."	B_S0
"And have every one who has active thoughts to coordinance is more likely to be a impossible tasks."	I_S0
"And when this situation happens, it requires lots of time to deal with even there is no solution to the disorder if no one will negotiate with each other."	I_S0
"For instance, my sister once was in a group works."	I_S0
"The teacher assigned a projects that each groups need to build a model for a car."	I_S0
"After all the joys her groups had, and when they needed to decide which material they become not harmonious."	I_S0
"Some said the car needed to be coated with the gilted silver, some said the car had to be marine blue."	I_S0
"After a long time, they could not negotiate and every one was stubborn."	I_S0
"She said if the project was assigned alone, she should have done it a long time ago."	E_S0
"Second, the situation might become weired that there will be one leader to guide the whole project."	S_M0
"As a research conducted by the MIT, the proportion of the group work turns into a single man guided group works will be higher than 56.8 percent."	B_S0
"It means that it will be more likely it will be one person to judge the whole project and lead the team."	I_S0
"If the project succeed, then the whole group succeed."	I_S0
"But, there is more likely to be a failure, then the whole team will take the price by the misleading of the leader person."	E_S0
"Third, if the project was assigned to be done by onlt one person, the person can prevent from the clamor and be high efficient."	S_M0
"As some people, they intend to enjoy the soleness of their own and wishes the absence of anyone who can potantially annoy them."	B_S0
"It actually has some scientific evidence that if one person will left alone, the hormone and pheromone level will decrease and let to the outcome of the reduce of the hippocampus which will reduce the stress from the outside stimulus and make people more concentrate."	I_S0
"People will be more high efficient and persistant."	E_S0
"To conclude, I disagree that students can learn more effectively than they are alone on projects."	S_C2
 
"I think charging admission to museums does more advantages than disadvantages,cause museum admission tickets can effectively control the flow of visitors and reduce the possibility of cultural relics being destroyed."	O
"In many people's eyes, a museum is a more formal occasion than a park."	S_M1
"Many non-local tourists visit the local museums when they come to a new place, which can help them learn the local culture and history faster."	B_S0
"But the museum does not charge admission, which means the influx of visitors can cause serious congestion,sometimes leads to dangerous incidents."	I_S0
"Some tourists who are not familiar with cultural relics may accidentally destroy them in the crowd,this will cause great loss to the museum."	I_S0
"Therefore ticket sales can control the number of visitors to the museum and avoid the museum from harm."	E_S0
"From an economic point of view, the operation of the museum need financial support."	S_M1
"The daily maintenance of the museum requires human and financial support."	B_S0
"If the museum does not charge admission, it will increase the pressure on the security guards and cleaners and reduce their enthusiasm for work."	I_S0
"People who are truly interested in art and culture are willing to pay for their hobbies."	I_S0
"Therefore, charging for museums can effectively help them select a whole of tourists whom really love it."	E_S0
"In general, it is worth paying for a visit for people who love culture and art。it will also help the museum avoid damage caused by overcrowding。"	O
 
"some people think young people Work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting college."	S_I0
"but other poeple think Students should finish their studies in college。
 When a young man goes straight from secondary school to university, his general knowledge and experience of the world is rather limited."	B_T0
"In contrast, those who spend their time making a living or traveling to other places have a broader view of life and better personal resources to draw upon."	E_T0
"When they come to campus, the experience can help students improve their learning efficiency."	B_S1
"They tend to be more independent, which is a very important factor in academic research and research, as well as advantages in coping with the challenges of student life."	E_S1
"However，Young people may not want to go back to college because they think it's better to have a job."	S_M1
"Young people may not calm down to learn the latter is listening to lectures, he has been used to the impetuous society is difficult to integrate into the environment of college students."	S_S2
"In consequence，It is good for young people to go to work as early as possible, because many companies need an internship certificate."	S_M1
"To experience the social environment as early as possible will save you time and make you more comfortable in the future"	O

"It is a contorversary topic."	I_I0
"I suppose that the initial pupose of this behavior is to give extre credit to these children for their hard-working and devotion to knowledge,as encouragement."	E_I0
"But I do not consider this action can paly a propose role in the children's childhood as it meant to be."	S_T1
"The way to praise children can be roughly devided into two parts,the sprital way and the material way."	S_M1
"At the beginning of the school-age children's childhood,they can be satisfied by praise words of parents or tfachers."	B_S0
"But later they become harder and harder to please."	I_S0
"At this moment,money may be an alteration but it could express the wrong message to children,which is that they study hard in order to get that money."	I_S0
"This wrong message may lead them to laziness as long as they cannot get paid or less paid by their parents."	E_S0
"It is parent's duty to educate children but what is more important is to help them build the correct concept of money and their life."	S_M1
"Seldom pay is acceptable but it is extremely harmful once becomes a pattern."	B_S0

"For North America and Europe, two regions where developed countries are concentrated, the distribution patterns of water consumption in the three parts are similar."	S_I0
"The other four less developed regions have similar overall patterns."	S_T1
"Developed regions, including North America and Europe, are dominated by industrial use, which accounts for about half of total water consumption (48% and 53% respectively), followed by agricultural use, which accounts for almost a third."	S_M1
"By contrast, household water use was the lowest in both regions, at 13 percent and 15 percent, but it was far higher than in the other four regions."	S_S2
"Obviously, less developed areas use more water in agriculture, up to 80 percent, at least 71 percent (in South America) and at most nearly 90 percent."	S_M1
"Therefore, it is conceivable that the proportion of water consumption in the other two aspects must be relatively small."	B_S0
"Households in Africa, central Asia and south-east Asia use no more than 10% of the total, while industry USES 5% to 7% less, up to 12%."	I_S0
"South America, by contrast, USES a lot of water for domestic use, with almost 20% of the water used for people's lives, and half of this figure used for industrial production in the region
It can be seen that water resources in developed areas are more distributed to economic products, including industry and agriculture, while less developed areas consume a large proportion of fresh water in agriculture."	E_S0

"We live in a population explosion era and with the process of urbanization，sometimes the metropolis is full of people and cars."	B_I0
"To this extent, traffic jam seems to be inevitable with the expansion of city."	I_I0
"To solve this problem，some people harbor that we should construct more railway lines for very fast trains between cities instead of improving existing public transport."	E_I0
"This is probably true to some extent，while from own prospective, we should emphasize on building new railway line coupled with a focus on improving existing public transport."	S_T0
"Those people who agree on the construction of new railway lines may hold the belief that more financial support need to conduct for develop traffic between different cities."	S_M1
"Of course, when more and more rural region near the huge city are exploited to new city area gradually，we should pay more attention to these area and invest more money on the traffic there."	B_S0
"Nowadays，people living in different cities may need to commute everyday for their works and a more developed public traffic is crucial for their daily job."	I_S0
"Apart from that，the railway line is indispensable sometimes for a new-established city."	I_S0
"A more convenient traffic may appeal more people to work and settle there."	E_S0
"However these people who demand to build new railway lines may ignore that improving existing public transport is also necessary to solve traffic problems."	S_M1
"Repairing the current transport may need less money and it can improve the traffic jam dramatically."	B_S1
"On the other hand，building a new traffic line need many time and a huge amount of finance, which may be unbearable for some small cities."	E_S1
"With a limited finance and time，constructing new railway lines contradicts improving existing public transport to some extent."	B_C0
"This seem to be a dilemma and these methods are both beneficial to our public transportation."	I_C0
"Consequently，we should find a proper balance between these two solutions."	E_C0
 
"The diagrams show the life cycle of the silkworm and the stages in the production of silk cloth."	S_I0
"A silkworm's life cycle can be divided into several phases."	B_T1
"A the begining, a moth produces eggs on the leaf."	I_T1
"After a period of 10 days or so, the eggs turn into silkworm larva, who are fed on mulberry leaf."	E_T1
"The stage will last 4 to 6 weeks until the larva builds a silk thread around itself."	B_S0
"Shortly after that, which is around 3 to 8 days later, it becomes a cocoon."	I_S0
"Finally, 16 days after the existence of the cocoon, a moth will come out of the cocoon."	I_S0
"Then a new cycle repeats."	E_S0
"The production of silk cloth contains a few steps."	S_M2
"Firstly, cocoon of high quality are selected, which are boiled in water afterwards."	B_S0
"Then comes the unwinding of the cocoon,which will become threads ranging from 300 to 900 meters."	I_S0
"Next is to twist the threads and dye them into different colors."	I_S0

"The pie charts compare the proportion of uising water for different purposes in six seperate regions of the world(North America,South America,Europe,Africa,Central Asia and Southeast Asia)."	B_S0
"As can be seen in the charts,the domestic water resource consumption accounts for the smallest proportion of each pie chart while the industrial and agricultural use of water take up a large part of the total amount respectively, especially the percentage of agricultural use of water in Africa, Central and Southeast Asia accounts over 80% each(84%,88%,81% )."

"In my opinion, I agree with the idea that celebrities influence younger people more than older people."	B_T0
"Several reasons can be found to prove this claim."	E_T0
"First of all, younger people such as children or students are in their formative years which their values and the ability of  thinking independently are still developing."	S_M0
"In this period of time, people are susceptible to any incident or event ,including            the influence of celebrities."	B_S0
"For example, when a young child is watching at an advertisement on TV, it is likely that he will be attracted by the appearence and voice of a famous person in that advertisement instead of the product."	I_S0
"But for adults, they focus more on the quality and reality of the products introduced in that advertisement because they are mature enough to know that it is the product that is important in an advertisement, not the person who suggests it."	E_S0
"Moreover, for older people, their living habits are already developed and fixed, because they have been getting used to them for a long time and their living conditions are often consistent."	S_M0
"But for young people, it is the same reason, that they are still growing, that can make their habits and living conditions vary, which gives the space for celebrities' influence."	B_S1
"For an instance, an adult will not exercise because a famous athlete suggests him to do so, since his daily schedule is filled with what he already used to do, wherese a child always has a much more flexible arrangement for his time and habits, he can chose to do exercises at any time he is willing."	E_S1
"Finally, since the development of younger people needs a variety of models like their parents and teachers, celebrities become a new option for them to learn from."	S_M0
"At the same time, these celebrities can also see this as an oppurtunity to increase their fame, and attend the TV shows or cartoons which young people like to veiw."	B_S1
"To sum up, this can be seen as a motivation that celebrities want to attract young people, and  the reason why young people become the targets of famous people."	E_S1
"In conclusion, the lack of independent thinking, the relatively free living conditions and arrangements, and as a way celebrities can improve their fame, are the reasons why young people receive more influence from celebrities than older people."	S_C2
 
"In current society,it's common to find that those in the senior management positions always have much higher salaries than those who in the same company or organisation but posted in the lower position."	S_T1
"The lower position workers may be unsatisfactory with it ,since in their shoes,the senior management merely need to arrange what they should do and evaluate their work."	B_S0
"The lighter work burden but the much higher salaries they get."	I_S0
"Indeed, this phenomenon seems to be unfair and ridiculous."	I_S0
"However,I still agree with the statement that it is a good thing for those in senior mangement positions to have much higher salaries than other worker in the same company or organisation for the following reasons."	I_S0
"For the beginning, you have to understand a truth that those who are in senior management positions are also posted in a lower position initially."	I_S0
"With time passes,they progressively acquires both higher skill or ability and accumulating experience."	I_S0
"They have once paid the unimaginary effort to get the senior management positions,thus,actually they have done more things than other workers in the same company or organisation,which worth higher salaries."	I_S0
"What's more,higher salaries can also help the company to reserve talented people so that the development of the whole company will be improved."	I_S0
"On top of that,I reckon that the most significant thing is that it can spur the work motivation of the lower position workers."	I_S0
"Here is an example,in the early establishment period of the People's Republic of China,every farmer got the same salaries and food,no matter how hard they worked."	I_S0
"Farmers who worked more got the limited salaries and the others who worked lower than the average work quantity got the salaries which couldn't be equal to their performance."	I_S0
"In a result,farmers lost their interest in cultivating and the amout of crops and vegetables was unable to feed all the Chinese."	I_S0
"That is to say,different salaries is a factor to motivate them to get a senior management positions and meanwhile,deserves the higher salaries."	I_S0
"I strongly believe that different salaries level system contributes to not only individual cultivation of abilities,but also the improvement of the whole company development."	E_S0
 
"In this day and age, people are increasingly enjoying the benefits of the development of the society."	S_I0
"However, they are also facecd with such problems as having to add more hours to the day, resulting in the fact that they have to make do with their nutrition schedule and in curtailing their physical health."	S_T1
"Many people hold that the government should not interfere with the fast food market, so that the problem should be takled by the business itself."	S_M0
"I, notwithstanding, regard this issue differently and my reasoning is presentied as follows."	S_S2
"First, our society should arguably not only be a community of money."	S_M0
"Government has the responsibility to assure that the health of its citizens not be sullied by any business."	B_S1
"In China, for instance, the government has made concrete measures including laws and policies against the usage of second-hand oil industry from supplying the fast food chains to protect its people from being harmed, embodying the national principles of its existence, which leads to order and harmony between customers and the business."	E_S1
"Second, levying taxes upon the fast food business will stimulate the other sectors of the country."	S_M0
"A family member of my friend has to work remote from home, where there is flood with fast food chains."	B_S1
"So if the taxes are in place, resulting in the reduce of these nearby chains, delivery service of bakery, restaurants of higher hygenic standards and so on will witness a large proliferation in income and, thus, would yield more revenue for the budget."	E_S1
"Last but definitely not the least, with a longer life span of the citizen in the long run by financially restricting  the fast food business, the country would maintain its vigor in labor force and save the budget by prolonging the working period of people, and cutting the health care outcome."	S_M0
"In China, the aging problem and its side-effects such as health care fees and relevant outcomes are looming ever larger."	B_S1
"And the method above may be a forcefull measure to handel this issue."	E_S1
"Thus, issuing financial disencouragement upon fast food business is, in a long period of time, a winning policy that will benefit various social sectors."	S_C2
 
"There is no denying that both two perceptions are reasonable."	S_T1
"However, I share the same sentiment with the former one."	B_S0
"As it is an universally acknoledged trend that our living pace are accelerating days and nights, thus, very fast trains has become the first choice for many people, especially the youngs."	I_S0
"The existing public transport such as undergrounds and taxis are cheap and, on the other hand."	I_S0
"over-fashioned."	I_S0
"For example, in many cities, the existing undergrounds are designed decades ago."	I_S0
"Hence, they are not able to fit the city which has been totally different after 10 years' development."	I_S0
"Increasing number of young people currently live in the surbub due to the remarkably high living expenditure."	I_S0
"For them, in-city public transports are not as important as before."	I_S0
"The new railway lines for very fast trains, by contrast, becomes priceless."	I_S0
"Young people are no doubt the major labor force in a country, so it is considerably important to meet their need."	I_S0
"Improving these existing traditional public transport are literally inconvinient."	I_S0
"Spending large sums of money on it is, as, a waste of time and finance."	I_S0
"To improve the existing public transport, it is inevitable to design a new one based to the existing one."	I_S0
"Therefore, there are many restrictions."	I_S0
"Constructing new railway lines, however, is relatively flexible."	I_S0
"Designers have a larger room for imagination that they can draw railway lines variously."	I_S0
"And these lines benefit the young people who are, living in the surbub, the major feul for country's development."	I_S0
"To take all these factors into consideration, in my opinion, spending  large amount of finance on constructing new railway lines for very fast trains between cities are necessary."	E_S0
 
"The graph illustrates the changes that happened at West  Park Secondary School's construction in 1950,1980 and 2010."	S_T1
"What's the biggest change that the houses near the main road were transformed into a car park and a science block in 1980."	B_S0
"The farmland which was located in the southern part of houses was replaced by a sports field in 1980."	I_S0
"From then on it was substituted a bigger car park that contained the car park in 1980."	I_S0
"However,the original school which was in close proximity to houses in 1950 was the main building both in 1980 and 2010."	I_S0
"The playground became smaller in 2010, and the sports field was on the eastern border of it."	I_S0
"Overall,there were many changes about construction since 1950."	E_S0
 
"In recent years,there is an argument that technology makes people's life complex."	B_I0
"Some thoughts think that technology makes life ver complex so no technology will make our life easier."	E_I0
"However,I tend to have a different viewpoint."	S_T0
"It is widely agreed that technology will complicate our life."	S_M1
"For example,AI,smartwatch,service type robot and so on."	B_S1
"Because they are high-tech products,the operation steps are relatively tedious,time is spent on the study of functions."	E_S1
"However, despite the relevance of the above arguments,I would claim that technology will make our life simply."	S_M1
"Because  it is convenience for people to use technology."	B_S1
"When people are traveling,they forget to bring their mobile phones,so if they bring a smart watch,they can keep in touch with their family and friends."	E_S1

"Precisely, the demand drops from 40,000 units at 3.00 to the bottom at 20,000 units at 8.00 before it soars to the highest point at 45,000 units at about 22.00."	B_S0
"It is followed by a sharp increase to nearly 35,000 units at 24.00."	I_S0
"In contrast, the time period between 0.00 and 9.00 witnesses a gentle decrease in the demand for electricity in summer, which is followed by a rise to the peak at 20,000 units, 25,000 units less than that in winter."	E_S0
"As for the pie chart, the purpose of electricity use involves four parts."	S_M1
"Heating rooms and water occupies the largest percentage (52.5%)."	B_S0
"The second largest component is ovens, kettles and washing machines which is 35% lower than the former one."	I_S0

"It is clear that studying abroad has been a global trend nowadays ."	S_I0
"This essay will firstly, discuss that studying abroad benefits the cultural exchange."	O
"Secondly, it is the drawback that studying abroad have to cost much money ."	S_T1
"In terms of benefits, studying abroad can enable a greater degree of 
cultural exchange."	S_M1
"From one culture to another cultural environment with large differences, not only can you learn more knowledge, but also help international students to add more methods of life, because when we communicate with people of different cultures, we will change Be more polite and try friendly interactions."	B_S0
"In the eyes of many international students, going abroad also broadens their horizons."	I_S0
"Not only can they learn more foreign cultures, but they can also reflect on the advantages and disadvantages of their own cultures."	I_S0
"Retain and carry forward in the correct national culture, and correct or abandon the negative cultural characteristics of those countries."	I_S0
"And to a certain extent, to influence more people around you, so that you can not only communicate with your own culture, but also increase cultural exchanges in society and internationally."	E_S0
"In terms of shortcomings, studying abroad is a high-end consumption method no matter in which country it seems."	S_M1
"Because international students not only change a surrounding environment, they may also change a language environment, the cost of language education is very large."	B_S0
"Whether it is a mainstream language, such as English, French or Chinese, it can also be a minority language, such as Spanish."	I_S0
"On the other hand, after going abroad, most of the international students are not that old, and they have not completely become an adult, which may make the international students develop some bad habits, especially in terms of consumption and money, such as ordinary Of international students can’t afford high-luxury brand clothes, but due to incorrect comparison psychology, this will make the international students have the desire to buy and compare, which will make the family burden even heavier."	E_S0
"In conclusion,  people who study abroad can be exposed to different cultures and customs, which will accelerate the integration of global cultures."	B_C0
"Take the daily conversation as a good example , when people from different countries are talking, they can know different cultures of different regions through the other words."	I_C0
"However, studying abroad also requires a large sum of money and  it is the truth that not everyone has the opportunity to study abroad."	I_C0
"Some younger students lack adult supervision after going abroad, which may lead them to have bad consumption habits."	I_C0

"So it's always been a debatable subject that what is the best way to spend the limited time with children."	I_I0
"I think the parent should have fun playing games or sports with their children together by following reasons."	E_I0
"First, the parent needs to obtain a strong relationship with their kids."	S_M1
"kids need a place to be felt safe to unload their feelings, and the parents are the best candidates."	B_S0
"The studies show that the stronger the relationship between the parents and kids are the less likely the kids will develop mental decide like depression."	I_S0
"For example, I watched a documentary, it 's a story about a depression patient."	I_S0
"The patient name Ryan, he developed depression when he was in high school."	I_S0
"Lots of the patients commit suicide and lost their life is because they didn't speak up, sometimes the closest people didn't know they have depression."	I_S0
"Ryan and his father are both like football, even his father is busy but his father will always bring his son to watch a football game at a studio once a month."	I_S0
"Unlike other patients, Ryan told his father about what he felt like every day."	I_S0
"And eventually, Rayn has diagnosed depression and receiving the help that he deserves."	E_S0
"Second, playing sports can make kids more healthy."	S_M1
"we all need to spend a lot of od time in school, and we just sit there and not moving very often."	B_S0
"So and some kids get obesity and some even worse, diabetes."	I_S0

"With the rapid development of modern society, much ink has been spilled about the children education."	B_I0
"An interesting discussion has arisen among the people: whether or not should parents endure their children to make troubles and develop themselves through these troubles."	E_I0
"From my perspective, I agree with the statement that parents are supposed to let their children develop independently through some mistakes."	S_T0
"Here are my main reasons for holding this opinion."	S_T1
"First of all, it's inevitable for children to make some troubles in their childhood, which provides a excellent opportunity for them to explore the surroundings."	S_M1
"Children may build the toy tower and destroy it to observe the physical phnenomenon, or they might try to disturb their parents' speaking to deliver their own opinions."	B_S0

"My own experience is a compelling example of this."	I_S0
"When I was a little kid, I used to be cruel to others and didn't want to play with my peers."	I_S0
"Sometimes I even used the terrible word toward them, that really hurt their feelings, even my parents."	I_S0
"But my parents just allowed me to learn the experience through these mistakes and left me alone."	I_S0
"During the process, I recognized that I should pay respect to the relatives and I developed the sound mentality at last."	E_S0
"Furthermore, children who have expericend a lot of challenges tend to have a higher persistence, which is conducive to a person's success."	S_M1
"Recently, some reseachers at China Academy of Social Science conducted a survey about the relationship between childhood experience and individual characters."	B_S0
"They drafted a list of questions centering on the abilities of people and asked the volunteers to fill out the questionnaire."	I_S0
"Among two hundred thousand people who wrote about their own answers, nearly 90 percent people admited that the challenges and troubles they made in the childhood contribute to the persistence."	I_S0
"This is a precious character to a person's future career, resembles like the concrete foundation of architecture."	I_S0
"To some extent, persistence is just the premise of a bright future."	E_S0
"To put it in a nutshell, I am in favor of the idea that parents are supposed to allow their childrenmake mistakes and learn by themselves through these mistakes."	B_C1

"Understanding these cycles,such as the flow of technological advancement,and being able to recognize the state of the times from historical perspects is an usefill skill for students to acquire."	I_S0
"For example, enterprising students who seek to earn a living through investment or entreprneurship could benefit by understanding the historical problems has had and still is facing."	I_S0
"This is not to say that science and technology cources are not important."	I_S0
"It is necessity for everyone nowadays to know science and technology if they are to adapt themselves to daily life."	I_S0
"For example, the popularization of high-thch devices in the whole socity means that everyone must have a basic understanding of how these devices function in order to use them."	I_S0
"Othervice,there is a strong point to be made for the career oppotunities in science and technology firlds compared to ones related to history."	I_S0
"Yet these facts  do not displace the need for a historical education."	I_S0
"If students focus only on the scientific and technological fields,and ignore history,they may develop poor attitude towards technology due to a lack of historical context."	I_S0
"In conclusion,my opinion is that history classes are as important now as they have ever been,and the need for an understanding of science and technology does not negate this."	E_S0

"Thus,the earlier you learn means you can have more time to foster great sense of this language."	I_S0
"What's more,comparing with learing in secondary school,student in an younger age can learn a new language better and quickly."	I_S0

"In some countries, high-speed rail is welcomed by many people because it can carry passengers between cities within a shorter period of time."	S_I0
"Some think the government should allocate a large sum of money into such railway lines, while others believe that the money should go to existing public transport."	S_T1
"Supporters of building high-speed rail argue that new railway lines can help save commuting time despite the massive investment."	S_M1
"With urban areas expanding further, more people may live in suburbs or even live in neighboring cities, and this means a new railway line between cities is especially important for those who need to travel to and from city center for work."	B_S0
"If there were not such high-speed rail, it is impossible for many people living in rural areas to commute in and out of the city every day."	I_S0
"Therefore, a significant investment in the construction of high-speed railway lines is justified."	E_S0
"However, there are also some opponents against such investment, myself included, and they think the funds should go to existing public transport."	S_M1
"One major reason is that high-speed trains are expensive and the same amount of funds can be used to improve most of the current transport, including buses and underground trains."	B_S0
"These are still the main transport by which thousands of people use every day."	I_S0
"Another possible reason is related to the demand."	I_S0
"It is reported that there are still a large percentage of people living in cities and a new railway line outside of the town can only serve a small percentage of people."	I_S0
"This means the investment is not a sensible decision."	I_S0
"Ultimately there would be not enough funds to run the new railway system."	E_S0
"In conclusion, I believe that although there are benefits to some people living outside of the city if high-speed trains are developed, the number of rural population is still relatively low and existing public transport is still the main choice for most of population and should therefore be the priority of the investment."	S_C2

"some believe that people learn a foreign language only for traveling or working in a foreign country,while others argue that there are some other reasons."	B_S0
"as far as i am concerned,i tend to agree with the latter view."	I_S0
"learning a foreign language is definitely important for traveling or working in other countries."	I_S0
"people can communicate with local citizens when they need help during their junery."	I_S0
"meanwhile,they can easily order something to eat in the restaurant or book a hotel."	I_S0
"for those people who need to work in a foreign country ,being bilingual can help them talk fluently with their colleagues or communicate with clients more efficiently so people can create more value they want."	I_S0
"however,some people start to learn a foreign language because they want to study abroad."	I_S0
"they need this essential skill to achieve their goals."	I_S0
"moreover,it can help people understand foreign books or blockbusters."	I_S0
"if we could easily search for information we need from other countries on the internet or know some original news from all over the world."	I_S0
"furthermore,it can broaden our view and make us think in a different way."	I_S0
"for teenagers,they can develop their learning ability because learning a different language is not so easy."	I_S0
"they have to be patient and practice a lot."	I_S0
"these will benifit them after growing up."	I_S0
"overall,the latter view is more reasonable."	I_S0
"considering there are so many other reasons for people to learn a foreign language and it is really a important skill for us."	I_S0
"i think government should encourage people to learn a foreign language."	E_S0
 
"Nowadays, the society is advocating a kind of value, from the nonprofit TV conmercials to textbook of pupils, that is to be honest."	B_I0
"According to this, we should always treat our friends honestly."	E_I0
"But, as far as I know, though it is something worth praizing, it is impossible to do it."	S_T0
"First, in most cases, being honest with your friends is preferable."	S_M0
"Only by knowing each other well, can friends help each other better."	B_S0
"For example, one of my firends, Colton once confronted an important math problems in his research, which confused him for several months."	I_S0
"Even though we met alot these time, he did not tell me it because of his shyness."	I_S0
"It turns out that the problem is within my scope, and if he told me earlier, I could have solved it for him."	E_S0
"Second, in some cases, a cheating will show more friendship than to be honest."	S_M0
"For example, if a person get a sever disease which needs the positive mood of the patient to recover, his friends should keep his disease as a secreat from him, since if he know the reality, he may feel dispired and aggrevate his state."	B_S1
"So, at this time, a cheating is a more proper behavior than honesty."	E_S1
"Third, sometimes, keeping some secreats from your friends can protects your private."	S_M0
"For example, once my friend Alic asked my math score after our math scores delivered from school."	B_S0
"Actually, I did not get a good score that time."	I_S0
"If I told him, I would have feel shamed."	I_S0
"So I did not told him, and kept it a secreat."	I_S0
"After that I realized that I was right, because my scores are of my private which should not be known by others as their will."	E_S0
"All in all, it is impossible to be honest with your firends all the time for there are all kinds of exceptions like private right and lovely cheating."	S_C2
 
"Nowadays,the competition among countries are becoming higher,so for some countries,the economy is significant."	S_I0
"In my view the other progress  and economic progress are both important."	S_T0
"First,the economic progress is the main standard to messure this country."	S_M1
"On the one hand ,if the economy grows,the output of business can increase,in this case,the profit will also rise."	B_S0
"As a result,the wages of employments will reach a higher level."	I_S0
"Then living standard of people in this country will  be improved as well."	I_S0
"On the other hand,the government will have benefit ."	I_S0
"The tax revenue will grow,they can use it to improve the infrastructures then the country will be  more developed."	E_S0
"However,the technology or environment progress are also significant for a country."	S_M1
"They are the basic factors to lead a better condition,for example,the transportation will bacome more convenient,and productivity of business will be higher."	B_S1
"What's more,the health condition of each people will be better when they are born in a  clean and tidy space."	E_S1
"In my opinion,they should both exist in a country."	B_C0
"Without the former, the country will be poorer,and government will take more risks to support the economy."	I_C0
"Without the latter,more health problem or wars will occur since the country is too weak."	E_C0
 
"The graph illustrates , between 1974 and 2002, the quantities of goods that be transported in four(road,water,rail,pipeline) ways."	S_T1
"Overall, except rail, others show an increasing trend in this period."	B_S0
"Water is similar to pipeline."	I_S0
"Betwen 1974 to 1982, they grew from 39 million toones and about 5 million tonnes respectively, and  water reached 55 million, the other one increased to 17 million."	I_S0
"After increasing dramativly in 1978 and 1982, water almost stayed unchanged until 1994,decreasing to 50 million and grew to 63 million in2002."	I_S0
"Pipeline lasted increasing to 1995 ,and kept stable from 1995 to 2002."	I_S0
"On the other hand, rail started at almost the same point as water, but delined until 1984."	I_S0
"After an increasing , rail kept decreasing to 15 million tonnes, folloed  growing to 41 million in 2002."	I_S0
"As for road, it always the highest amonf these ways."	E_S0
 
"Some of people hold the idea that we have too many choices nowadays."	S_I0
"However, some other people think that there are not too much choices for us."	S_T0

"As for study, we are now experiencing a special period."	S_M1
"Most of us are exposed to online class."	B_S0
"We could still have class without real face-to-face class."	I_S0
"Such studying way has various styles like class which was recorded or live."	I_S0
"This is what we have too many choices for class."	I_S0
"Recent years, as the development of international comunucation."	I_S0
"We students as well have more ways to achieve their study."	I_S0

"In recent years, it has been an increasingly widespread trend that a growing number of individuals have many health problems owing to the excessive consumption of junk food."	S_I0
"Some people believe that the government should enhance the tax on fast food."	S_T1
"Personally, I think it may give rise to some demerits in spite of a merit."	B_S0
"There is no denying that there are some people with conflicting ideas."	I_S0
"The reason behind may involve tha fact that fast food contain  numerous of oil and sugar, leading to the likelihood that people who always consume these food suffer from several diseases like obesity, high blood pressure."	I_S0
"So the government impose a high tax could resist the consumers to purchase these unhealth food."	I_S0
"On the comtrary, the benefit mentioned above pales into insignifance when compared with its drawbacks."	I_S0
"One possible reason to support my view is that if the price of the fast food increases dramatically, contributing to the possibility that the poor especially the beggars are less likely to choose these product as their meals."	I_S0
"That is to say they might lack of food to live and the gap between the rich and the poor are more and more wide which may lead those people to have some unti-social behaviours."	I_S0
"Anthother cause is that it is not a necessary way to reduce the rate of citizens exposuring to these health problems."	I_S0
"There are some other actions could be taken to alleviate these dieases like doing physical exercise, having a healthy diet, giving rise to the possibility that not only the poor have their food bit also the rich are fitness."	I_S0
"To sum up, although rising fast food's price can reduce some health problems to some extent, the most important way to combat this situation is to have a healthy lifestyle."	E_S0
 
"With the development of the digital technology, people have a lot of choices to spend too many times by watching TV programs."	S_T1
"But this prononment has leds to the  rapidly decline in the television quality."	B_S0
"In my viewpoint, I think the emergrency of the  multi-cultural channel is a good for citizens, the reason is that they can assess a lot of different area to study and improve their thinking."	I_S0
"So I will discuss both views and come up with my opinion."	I_S0
"First of all, a lot of TV program who support the emergency of diversifield forms."	I_S0
"It is because that they make it is easier for  person to choose different TV show according to individual tastes."	I_S0
"For instance, a half of children enjoy some show about fairtaly , they can choose what they want."	I_S0
"It can help some TV program consider different people and improve how to make more people concern about what they need."	I_S0
"Futhermore, an easy access to various of program gives a great comvient for the individuals to recongise their mentally needs."	I_S0
"Nevertheless, some people think some TV program have low quality for people."	I_S0
"Because a lot of TV channels are willing to increase a lot of different choice, and they ignore what is good for the different people ."	I_S0
"For example, there are many vulgar tv program are not suitable for teenagers."	I_S0
"At the same time, some programs are very boring and distract the students' concern."	I_S0

"Moreover,it also support students to go aboard for studying in  prestigious universities."	I_S0
"Before studying in a foreign country ,learning native language is also a good way to adjust their culture and natives."	I_S0
"Adjusting their culture including which food they like to eat,which games they like to play,what their habits in daily life,even what jokes they always say."	I_S0
"This method can help peoople reduce their pressure in making friends with locals and normal communication between counterparts."	I_S0
"Whether a number of the reason,someone learn a foreign language depends on their own needs."	I_S0
"From a student  to a visitor,from an employer to someone who is going to migrate,they have their reasons to study the native language."	I_S0
"Or just to be a linguish researsher,he wants to improve his professional knowlege."	I_S0
"All in all, a  foreign language is unlikely to fullfill a jouney or a working experience,it is the process for understanding a country's culture and history."	I_S0
"Learning a different country' language is not meaningless ."	E_S0
 
"With the world changing so rapidly, some thinks that people are less happy with their lives than people were in the past."	S_I0

"First, people are more satisfied because they can keep in touch with their friends and families easily whenever and wherever they are, thanks to our advanced technology."	S_M0
"In the past, people suffered from home-sickness, when they were away from home."	B_S0
"It was hard for them to get in touch with far-away friends or families."	I_S0
"Nowadays, we can enjoy keeping touch with our families and friends regardless of the distance between us."	I_S0
"Take me for instance."	I_S0
"I study in Hubei province, which is quite far from my hometown."	I_S0
"Everytime I miss my family or my old friends, I would call them, or talk to them face to face with the aid of Wechat or Facebook."	I_S0
"I cannot imagine what if I cannot talk to them a whole month as our ancestors did."	I_S0
"I may be sick due to missing my family."	I_S0
"Thus, I think people are more happy because they can get close to their family with the help of phones or internet."	E_S0
"Second, people are more happy because they can enjoy enormous materies, without need to worry about lacking of food, etc."	S_M0
"It is common to see the bright smiles when people buy their favourite food or clothes."	B_S0

"My grandma told me she had four brothers, one of who died of starvation in World War II."	I_S0
"I know this is really painful for her."	I_S0
"This terrible thing is so far away from most of us."	I_S0
"We are happier without worrying about food which may take our life or our families away."	E_S0
"Third, people are more satisfied because they have access to much more entertainments."	S_M0

"In today's day and age, there are an increasing number of people try to add their thoughts to their children so that they can play a role in and influence their children's lives."	B_T0
"Nevertheless, in my own point of view, children need to experience their own lives."	I_T0
"which is the life the want to spend."	E_T0
"Granted, it's important to take advice from your families as they are older than you and they experience more, their suggetions may be quite useful."	S_M0

"in many area nowadays, people who live like which their family suggest them to live, has a really nice experience as the advice are quite useful and suitable."	E_S1
"However, some families will influence and lead their children into a bad way, which means the way that is not suitable for them."	S_M0
"It may be learn a major that they hate or work in the area that they are not interested in."	B_S0
"For instance, one of my favorite bloger paste a vedio that his mom told his to choose the economics major, but his interest is in computer."	I_S0
"He regreted for the whole of his senior high school for 3 years and he couldn't change that during the university."	I_S0
"At last, he dropped out of school and abandoned the opportunity os study."	I_S0
"Influence from families will not alway be useful and valuable to a child."	E_S0

"Some people agree but others have the opposite views."	E_I0
"In my opinion, I agree with the latter one that teachers should not do this to students."	S_T0
"First of all, talking about social or political views will have bad influence to students' study."	S_M0

  The unemployment rate is about the same at every stage, about half as high as further education, and the gap with part-time work is widening as degrees rise."	I_S0

"Second, people no longer spend more time with their families."	E_T1
"First, the improvement in technology make it easier for people to contact on the internet using chat programs such as skype, viper, Facebook, ect."	S_M1
"For instance, I always send about 20 message at least to my friends on what’s App every day and never try to call them on phone or meet with them."	B_S1

"But I think that increasing taxes will not improve this social problem."	S_T0
"It is true that raising taxes can increase the price of fast food accordingly so that people can reduce the number of fast food choices."	S_M0
"And the government can invest this income into the health care system, but this is only a temporary solution to the problem."	S_S2
"Most people who choose fast food are young people and white-collar workers."	S_M0
"The former because of the love for fast food such as fried chicken, burgers, and french fries."	B_S0
"The latter is due to the convenience and speed of fast food, they have little savings and usually do not have time to cook their own meals."	I_S0
"Increasing taxes will not have a big impact on this hobby of young people, and it will also put more pressure on busy white-collar workers."	E_S0
"I think what the government can do is to promote the impact of eating a lot of fast food on the human body and then put it on TV, the Internet, mobile phones, and advertising banners."	S_M0
"The main goal is for teenagers and their parents to let them know how to control the frequency of fast food choices to stay healthy."	B_S0

"First, social media applications have completely changed the way we communicate."	B_S0
"Today, the reason many people believe this is that you can instantly connect with family and friends through many social media applications (such as Weibo, Instagram, and Twitter)."	I_S0
"It can also be said that people are now encouraged to share their views publicly through the Internet."	I_S0
"A good example is that people using social media applications have a large number of "friends" in their contact list."	E_S0
"However, just as coins have two sides, the impact of social media on a person 's social life may not always be positive."	S_M1
"This is because people are now more and more inclined to give up face-to-face interaction and prefer to communicate while hiding behind the screen."	B_S0
"This will cause more people, especially young people, to lost in their way in aspects of personal communication."	I_S0
"A good example is a survey conducted by an international research organization on the length of time people spend online."	I_S0
"The data shows that the average netizen spends about 6 hours and 42 minutes a day on the Internet."	I_S0
"Among them, the average time spent by young people on the Internet is up to 8 hours and 19 minutes which almost 90% of their free time."	E_S0

"Nowadays, it's necessary to concentrate on the energy one used and the impact from it to the environment."	B_I0
"The two chart instruments the average value of some categories usd by Australia household and the greenhouse gas come from each of them respectively."	E_I0
"As is showed in the first chart, the energy used by heating makes up the largest proportion with 42%, followed by the utilization of water heating with 30%."	S_M1
"On the contrary, the refrigeration, lighting and cooling all makes up lower than 10%, with 7%, 4%, and 2% only."	S_S2
"However, the greenhouse gas emissions from them are totally different."	S_M1
"There are 32% of the gas come from the water heating, which account for the lagest of the whole gas."	B_S0
"Fllowing that, other appliances discharge 28% ,and heating discharges 15%."	I_S0
"Yet the cooling discharges 3% only, which is the smallest."	E_S0

"Even if  when the children grow up independent of the family,it is impossible to change their character."	I_T1
"Therefore,disagree with the idea that the life outside from family has greater impact for people."	E_T1
"It has to be said that the environment outside the family has a great impact on children."	S_M1
"For example,children are sent to school to learn knowledge at the age of six."	B_S0
"The new environment affects every aspect of the children."	I_S0
"They learn from the teachers,meet new friends and interact with them."	I_S0
"Through these experiences ,people accumulate lessons about how to deal with people and how  to deal with these relationships,what is external environment teaching people,It seems that the external environment has a great influence on a person."	E_S0
"However,the family education,or parenting to be exact,turns our to be more profound and root."	S_M1
"Objectively speaking,when a family has enough money, they will send their children to recive higher education,and their children will have a good life no matter where they are in the future,On the contrary,if a poor family is unable to send their children to school,their children willlose a lot of learning opportunities and their educational level will be low."	B_S1
"As well as that,children's vaule towards people,right and wrong and even goal of life is deeply affected."	E_S1
"To sum up,I don't agree with the poinion that others factors influence more than family itsely as the value is formed there and it can be recognized in nearly all aspects in the later part of life."	S_C2
 
"I agree with this statement."	S_T0
"On the one hand,struggling people can be better accepted by the company,and struggling people are easier to make friends because they can get other's aprove and admire."	S_M1
"On the other hand,all people want to be a struggling man and want to make their bestto do many things,but most of us are not able to use our best."	B_S1

"And why people are more willing to help thr strangers?"	S_M1
"Recent ages,we are more likely to pay our attetions to protect ourself,so when we are happening to talk with the stragers,our mind are always warning."	B_S1

"So how do we get there?"	I_S0
"It is not difficult to find a solution by comparing practical examples."	E_S0
"Our neibour Japan has a lesson to learn about recycling, an important part of daily life."	S_M2
"In my opinion,goverment should make it a legal obligation for householders to tachle the waste into different bins."	B_S1

"In order to raise the general living standard of individuals, governments decided to provide free access to higher education to students in many countries."	S_T0
"However, some people claim that it is students' obligation to pay the bill instead of the government."	B_S0
"Personally, I agree with this statement."	I_S0
"Admittedly, students from poverty-striken families is likely to be unable to afford the school fees."	I_S0
"In order not to deprive their right for studying, the government is supposed to pay their tuition fees."	I_S0
"However, for students in relatively wealthy family, such a financial aid seems to be unnecessary, since they absolutely have the affordability of the fees."	I_S0
"Therefore, the government is expected to  offer a special aid to those students who come from a poor family instead of providing such an aid to all students in the whole society."	I_S0
"Additionally, it is reasonable for the government to bear only the cost of fundamental education but not higher education."	I_S0
"By the time that they are graduted from middle school, students are old enough to be responsible for paying their own tuition fees, as they can look for a part-time job."	I_S0
"Also, after receiving basical education, many underprivileged students may choose to find an occupation in order that they can earn a living at an early age."	I_S0
"Besides, since government budget is quite limited, they cannot satisfy all requirements of individuals."	I_S0
"If government expenditure need not to cover the cost of higher educations, they can dedicate more money in improving infrastructures such as public transport systems and hospitals, which are considered to be equally essential as education."	I_S0
"In conclusion, students are supposed to pay tuition fees themselves out of several reasons."	I_S0
"Moreover, the government need to allocate the expenditure appropriately to benefit as many people as possible."	E_S0
 
"Economic progress in a country is regarded as the most important target, since many governments believe that the living standard, educational and technological level can be better only when the econmy is prosperous."	S_T0

"There is no denying  that economy is the foundation of comprehensive advancement."	S_M1
"With sufficient funds, the financial institutions can invest in backward areas, promoting coordinated development and narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor."	B_S1
"It means that economy is one of the vital factors to measure a country's power."	E_S1
"Others, to a large extent, argue that culture, technology and policy also should be considerated as the critical goals."	S_M1
"Compared with the past when people pursed a materialistic life like eating and wearing, the economic level is no longer the only pursuit now, since individuals gradually needs the spirit of culture or entertainment."	B_S0
"Culture and traditions, the soft power of a country, also can be the basis of developing distinctive business and cultivating diversified talents."	I_S0
"In addition, technology progress , such as smart household eletrical appliances and new drugs research, is in line with public current needs of life."	I_S0
"Moreover, the local policies should keep pace with the times as well as."	I_S0

"It is obvious that working or visiting abroad could be a strong motivation."	I_S0
"Although with technology developing, some convenience tools have been invented such as translating machine, people who have the ability to communicate with others fluently usually are the basic demand when the foreign enterprises hire employees."	I_S0
"The other important reason is that language often are complicated, and even small inaccuracy could lead to misunderstanding in daily life."	I_S0
"So that might encourage people to study a new language."	I_S0
"However, not everyone would agree that, in fact, there are various reason for becoming multiple language users."	I_S0
"As the different culture affects, lots of people are keen to learn new languages in order to experience culture from countries all over the world, like movies, comics, music, and pop stars."	I_S0
"Also, bilinguals (or more) have more advantages on the human resource market even for those residential companies."	I_S0
"With globalization, almost every company has chances to deal with abroad enterprises, which means it is essential to get information from each other equally."	I_S0

"Firstly,the way of some teacher is very boring in the study that causing a lot of students in learning to produce resistance."	B_S0
"Actually."	I_S0
"the teacher should take into account the student's interest in class and according to the requirement of the students in teaching."	I_S0
"Secondly,students don't know the importance of learning for life."	I_S0
"Many students do not understand why you need to study,so they can produce negative thoughts to the study in learning without purpose."	I_S0
"Finally,the parents don't have a correct guidance to the students."	I_S0
"As the saying goes,parents are the first teachers of children's education."	I_S0
"But now,many parents are busy working and ignore the education od their children,leading to many children can't to correctly understand the importance of learning."	I_S0
"To sum up,students leave school with a negative attitude to have a lot of reasons."	I_S0
"School should adjust the way to let the students interest in learning."	I_S0
"At the same time ,students should also understand that learning is not only the tasks in school,after work should also be conatantly learning ,so as to face the work better."	I_S0
"people grow only continuous learning,can not eliminated by society."	I_S0
"Finally,parents should help children to set up the correct learning concept,more concerned about their children's learning situation,only in this way can we truly help children to grow up."	E_S0
 
"Today lots of countries are will toinvest in art."	S_T1
"For example, building art museum, holding art exhibitions, setting up sculpture and so on."	B_S0
"Some people suggest that art is necessary to be invest,while some people believe public services and facilities are the part whick nee to be spent more money on than on art."	I_S0
"in my opinion ,it depends on what this country it is."	I_S0
"As for the people who have the opinion that it is important to to spend money in art,i believe that they have high quality of life standard, which means they don't need to worry about raiment and daily bread."	I_S0
"So this kind of people have more free time to the things they enjoy like apprecictinf art playing golf because this kind of luxury actives can improve their aesthetic standard and colourful their life."	I_S0
"However, the other side peoplr think public services and facilities need to spend more money."	I_S0
"For this kind of people who are the majority working class or proletariat, owning nothing but their labour, which they have to sold to the bourgeoisie in order to survive."	I_S0
"This kind of people, they don't have too much their own time."	I_S0
"For example  they need to follow the roles about the time, if they are late the salary they can get will be reduced."	I_S0
"In my mind, i agree both views, but i think there is a key point about those two kinds of voices, background, which means that the situation of the socity."	I_S0
"If the minority capitalist class live in the country which full of wars, i don't believe that they have mood to admire how amazing art it is."	I_S0
"Furthermore the proletariat in a developed and peaceful country, government will offer developed public supports ehich not need to spend to much money in it."	E_S0
 
"The pie chart describes three different types of nutrients which definitely do harm to people's health occupies the proportion averagely in typical meals."	S_I0
"Foremost, the percentage of sodium consumed in the dinner is the maximum (43%), while the second largest consumption of sodium is seen in the lunch (29%), and that of breakfast and snacks occupies the same proportion (14%)."	S_M2
"Similarly, the proportion of saturated fat which is consumed in the dinner is the largest as well (37%), while that of lunch also is the second largest (26%), and the figure for snacks is 5% higher than that of breakfast (21% versus 16%)."	B_S1
"On the contrary, 42% of added suger is consumed in the snacks, is the largest, and that of dinner is 23%, followed by 19% in the lunch and 16% in the breakfast."	E_S1
"Overall, for sodium and saturated fat, both of them is consumed the most in the dinner, but that of added suger is the snacks."	S_S2
 
"The two pie chart compare the percentages of online sales across different retail sectors in New Zealand in the years 2003 and 2013."	S_I0
"As 36% we can see that the travel sector accounted for the majority of online sales in 2003,but this percentage had dropped to 29% by 2003."	S_M0
"Across the same ten-year period ,as an increasing number of people chose to purchase films and music online,we can see that transactions went from just 21% to 33%,making it the detail sector with the highest overall share of the online market."	S_S2
"In 2003, the clothing industry boasted an impressive 24% of total online sales in New Zealand."	S_M0
"However, by 2013, the figure had fallen considerably to 16%."	B_S1
"Interestingly, online sales of books eventually overtook sales of clothes, although books still represented only 22% of the market."	E_S1
"Overall, the sectors of travel and clothes illustrate the decrease about 7% and 8% respectively while the percentage of film and music and books had increased to 33% and 22% by 2013 respectively."	S_M0
"Among these figures, the percentage of film/music sector shows the most fluctuation."	S_S2
 
"The bar chart mainly demonstrate the information about the percentage of British students who study in a particle university that can speak other  languages except the mother tone."	S_T1
"There were  20% students could not speak other language which only smaller than the proportion of student who can control the spanish only(30%）and the sum of these two ouccupied half of the total students."	B_S0
"In addition students controled one or two other languages accounted 10%and15% respectively,which had the same proportion with that of French and German
After one decade, the proportion of student only can speak English
decrease dramatically to only 10%,while that of Spanish another one and two languageall increase by 5%."	I_S0
"But  that of French illustrate an opposite trend decrease by 5% and percentage of student speaking German keep constant with 10%."	E_S0
"in summary ,the decade between 2000 and 2010 witnessed a large  change of the percentage."	S_M2
"Less student only can speak English and Spanish became more and more popular."	S_S2
 
"In this day and age, Internet plays a vital role in everyday situations, so this is absolutely necessary to improve Internet access."	S_I0
"However, as an indispensable part in any sphere of life, public transportation is also in great need to have improvement."	B_T0
"From my point of view, it is more crucial to improve the latter one than the former one."	I_T0
"My opinion will be amplified by the following reasons."	E_T0
"First and foremost, improvements on public transportation allows less accidents."	S_M1
"This is mainly because people will no longer drive or ride an motorcycle to work, thus leading to the decrease in accidents."	B_S0
"A salient example of this can be seen in my friend's experience."	I_S0
"He walked to school every day and there was a roud without traffic lights just in front of his community."	I_S0
"Every day it was dangerous for him to walk through since in China the automobiles would not let the passengers go first, which was easy to get hurt."	I_S0
"One day, there was a motorcycle clashing into him."	I_S0
"He was hurt but he told no one."	I_S0
"Finally when he got home, he told his parents that he felf painful."	I_S0
"It was until then did his parents know the accident."	I_S0
"As the instance reveals, if more poeple go to work or school by public transportation, there will be less people getting injured."	E_S0
"In addition, it provides great benefits to the enviroment."	S_M1
"This is largely due to the fact that less people drive the car, thus the exhaust gas from the car reducing."	B_S0
"As a result, the enviroment in this area will be perfected in a large scale."	I_S0
"For example, the time for people in a specific city to drive the cars are strictly restricted."	I_S0
"If the last number of their car plate is an odd, they cannot drive the car the the day when the date is even."	I_S0
"With this limit, the time people drive decreases."	I_S0
"So the air in that city is fresher than the other one in this country and the river is much cleaner."	I_S0
"People are even allowed to see the blue sky and beautiful birds on the tree."	I_S0
"As this example demonstrates, improvements on the public transportation can lead to decrease in drive and hence a better enviroment."	E_S0
"It is true, to some extent, that almost all people rely on Internet access."	B_C0
"However, people can use a smart phone with more available data and stop using it for their eyes when there is no Interenet connection."	I_C0
"Consequently, due to the benefits listed above, it is more crucial to improve public transportation than Internet access."	E_C0
 
"Graduates prefer staying in the domestic universities in the past time."	B_I0
"From the globazation coming, more youth choose to go abraod for more chances and experiences."	E_I0
"Because of the limitation and high price to go abroad, more youth did a university degree in the close college."	B_T1
"It was a best choice for the common people to get the country's scholarship so that they parents don't worry about their tuition."	I_T1
"However, everyone get a better life,many professions and materials in China have been occupied by elites."	E_T1
"If college students stay in the country, they will face many problems, such as the lack of jobs and low wages."	B_S1
"More people choose to study abroad now."	E_S1
"There are seveal benifits of staying abroad."	S_M1
"First of all,there are more majors in foreign universities, which can help you find out what you want to do in the future,such as biotechnology, sociology, etc."	B_S0
"Then,when you study abroad, you can know many people of different cultures, understand the differences of different cultures, and learn some experiences."	I_S0
"For example, when you travel, you can know some taboos and popular ones."	E_S0
"As it should be some negative points of that,if you take a refresher course of some high-tech skills,For example, rogue countries like the United States won't let you go back to your country because they think it's a national research secret."	S_M1
"And if a large number of people flow into foreign countries, it will have a great impact on their own country, just like the passage of a large number of pillars, which will lead to the lack of talent development in those countries."	S_S2
"In a word, studying abroad has both advantages and disadvantages."	S_C2
"Whether to study abroad requires not only money and channels, but also the ability to succeed"	O
 
"Do you feel that to obtain useful information from internet is very quickly?"	B_I0
"DO you think that these information are very useful?"	E_I0
"The answer must be true because these information could help students to solve some problem of study."	B_T0
"Moreover these valuable information can let our life become more and more convineance."	E_T0
"Firstly, these information from the internet can help students solve some issue which come from the study."	S_M1
"For instance, one day I took a chemical lesson, out teacher let us to find the component of the air but he did not tell us how to conduct this investigation."	B_S0
"For this situation, I open the Chrome website and input the main word ''air'' ; just several seconds later I find the information which about how to conduct the investigation about the component of the air."	I_S0
"And this passage gave me very detailed information such as what kind of implements will use in this investigation and the process of this subject."	I_S0
"It is a very valuable information because after I read this passage, I can conduct the investigation very smoothly."	I_S0
"In the next day, I was the most outstanding student during the chemical class and teacher also please me to do a presentation to my classmates."	I_S0
"So the internet can provide a lot of valuable information, which bring a lot of benefit to my academic subject."	E_S0
"Secondly, this information also can bring a lot of benefit to our life."	S_M1
"For instance, if we plan go out to have a travel, we can select the sittings that are worth to play very actually."	B_S0
"This is because, we can see some pictures on the screen of the computer and even know the price of the ticket; the hotal nearby the sitting."	I_S0
"The most important is we can see the views of other people who have been travel to these sitting."	I_S0
"By this way, we can know deeper and all these useful information will benefit us during the travel time."	E_S0
"All in all, these information from the internet not only help us do some investigation of study but also let us life become more convineance."	S_C2
"So I think"	O
 
"It is true that we do not recycle enough of our household waste."	S_T1
"Although I accept that new legislation to force people to recycle could help this situation, I do not agree that a recycling law is the only measure that governments should take."	S_T0
"In my view, a new recycling law would be just one possible way to tackle the waste problem."	S_M1
"Governments could make it a legal obligation for householders to separate all waste into different bins."	B_S0
"There could be punishments for people who fail to adhere to this law, ranging from a small fine to community service, or even perhaps prison sentences for repeat offenders."	I_S0
"These measures would act as a deterrent and encourage people to obey the recycling law."	I_S0
"As a result, the improved behaviour of homeowners could lead to a clean, waste-free environment for everyone."	E_S0
"However, this does not automatically mean that a relevant law can ultimately convert people's lifestyle to an eco-friendly one."	S_M1
"Thus, I believe that governments should do more than simply introduce a recycling law."	B_S0
"It might be more effective if politicians put education, rather than punishment, at the centre of a recycling campaign."	I_S0
"For example, children could be taught about recycling in schools, and homeowners could be informed of the environmental impact of household waste."	I_S0
"Finally, money could also be spent in improving recycling facilities and systems, so that waste is processed more effectively, regardless of whether or not people separate it correctly in the home."	E_S0
"In conclusion, perhaps we do need to make recycling a legal requirement, but this would certainly not be the only way to encourage people to dispose of their waste more responsibly."	S_C2
 
"Do you think it is important for a student to have some sports acticities in their spare time?"	B_I0
"So will you balance your sports and study time?"	E_I0
"From my perspective, I really agree with the statement that sports and study should be regared as equal and then get the same financial support."	S_T1
"Only if we have healthy and energetic body, we can have the capital to study."	S_M1
"A strong body is the basis to study, let alone study in a high efficiency."	B_S0
"Yaoming, a famous Chinese basketball player, is a typical instance to support my point of view."	I_S0
"When he was a high school student like most of the students, he finished a bunch of assignments given by teacher, had highly intensed classes everyday and so on."	I_S0
"But he always slept on class and is really lacked energy during the study process."	I_S0
"After getting familiar with the importance of sports, he tried to have exercise everyday."	I_S0
"He became really enjoy the sweating from running, the breathing after jumping and so on."	I_S0
"What's more, he never slept on the class anymore and he felt extremely rejuvenated after some appropriate sports acticities, so the study effiency is greatly increased a lot."	I_S0
"We can obviously know that having sports acticities can help us have a health body, which is necessry during study, and then we can both have some rest in the exercise time and study in a more high efficiency."	I_S0
"Thus, the importance between should be regared the same and definitely get the same financial support from universities to build more sports facilities and chances for students."	E_S0
"Although social activities seem like a kind of entertainment, it can really teach us a lot which can not learn from the books in library and the teaching from classes."	S_M1
"Taks myself, a social activities lover in high school, as an example to illustrate my own statement."	B_S0
"I love participating social activities, including present exchange party, birthday party, dance meeting, speech matches, club activities and so on."	I_S0
"All I dois try my best to join in those social activities in my spare time as much as I can."	I_S0
"The difference between my and those people who only seat in the class is that I was more outgoing and can communicate with others fluently without out any nervousness."	I_S0
"Also, my friends are always much more than them, so I never feel lonely and boring in my study time."	I_S0
"Thus, the universities should spend their money also on holding some social activities for those people who are really shy and only love studying but can not do nothing when they leave the class."	I_S0
"Social ability is necessary in everyone's life and can be only learned from the true condition but not the books and teacher's theories."	E_S0
"In summary, universities should give financial support the same as the classes and sports activities."	S_C2
"No one is less important than the other one,"	S_S2
 
"Nowsadays,with the popularity of the televisions,more and more TV channels appear at the same time."	S_T1
"Whether too many programmes is benefit from the public has became a debatable problem."	B_S0
"My view is that the benefit of the huge number of the channels will overwhelm the drawback of them."	I_S0
"Firstly ,more TV channels means more choices of them."	I_S0
"Because they want to attract more audiences by a variety of the context in the programmes."	I_S0
"Moreover,this will make contributions to the development of the media while average the number of the audiences in the every channels,relieve the pressure of single one."	I_S0
"besides,due to the choices that people can choose increase,the aggregate advertisement of thetelevisions become more than before."	I_S0
"It is obvious that the economical development will be improved because of the advertisement."	I_S0
"For examples,more citizens can get more informations about the shopping from the televsions in the any channels."	I_S0
"So I think that is very helpful for improving the living standard ,not only in the aspect of the amusement in the TY."	I_S0
"That is not to say that the disadvantages which are caused by the more programmes is ignored."	I_S0
"If the many tv  channels are introduced in a poor quality ,this will make the recreation industry get seriously negative influnces."	I_S0
"But i think that the competitions in this will lead them to become more cost-effcient and interesting."	I_S0
"In conclusion,I think the benefit of the immense size of the tv channels overpower the shortages of it."	I_S0
"the development is irresistable."	E_S0
 
"Going abroad becomes a common thing around world."	S_T1
"Some people think studying a foreign language is just order to work or travel in another country."	B_S0
"Others think studying a another language another reasons."	I_S0
"I agree the last opinion."	I_S0
"When people go abroad, it is needed to a foreign language."	I_S0
"Some people go to another country and they do not want to hire a translator as it is very expensive to applicate."	I_S0
"Then they study the language."	I_S0
"Besides, some people think they can earn more money in another country than inland."	I_S0
"And if they study a foreign language,it  will be easier to communicate with local people and do not always need to bring the translator."	I_S0
"However, there are some other reason, people should learn a foreign language."	I_S0
"In my opinion, I think  studying a foreign country can make more friends in any place."	I_S0
"In the community, there are several foreigners, if we can speak the foreign language, we can help these foreigners when they are in trouble and make them feel closer in our country, then we can make friends with them."	I_S0
"Besides, I think translated articles cannot express the foreign emotions and culture better than original articles, so we need to study a foreign language and read original foreign articles, then we can find more interesting things and study more knowledge in the original articles."	I_S0
"In conclusion, studying a foreign language when we will go to travel or work in another country is not the only reason why we should study."	I_S0
"I think more important things are that we can make more friends and learn more knowledge in foreign languages."	E_S0
 
"There is no denying that several languages die out in the past few years."	S_I0
"Some people pay little attention to it because life will be easier if there are fewer languages in the world."	B_T0
"I think this phenomenon should be considered."	E_T0
"To begin with, at the present time, world goes to become more united, and many people in world have to communicate to each other."	S_M1
"Clearly if there is a common and popular language in world, this is very easier for people to travel to other countries."	B_S1
"With the same language, it will be helpful for people to reduce the misunderstanding if they are not from the same country."	E_S1
"On the other hand, there are thousands of different languages in the world nowadays."	S_M1
"Each of them is a symbol of a specific nation and some of them could date back to thousands of years ago."	B_S0
"So the languages might reflect the culture and custom of certain societies."	I_S0
"Besides, extinction of indigenous language cause to ruin many cultures, costumes, religions and literatures."	I_S0
"These facts build many people and countries' histories."	I_S0
"These histories were built along many years."	I_S0
"For example, Greece language is common language in the old Greek."	I_S0
"Greece people do many wars for conquering to other people."	I_S0
"But now, with the death of Greece language those attempts are destroy."	I_S0
"Thus, it is very important to protect old languages."	E_S0
"In conclusion, I think it is not a good idea to ignore the fact that several languages die out every year."	B_C1
"Effective actions should be taken to protect them from fading away."	E_C1
 
"It is a very commen phenomenon that many young students are leaving schools with negative thoughts on studying in the current situation."	S_T1
"There are different reasons such as feeling boring about the school life,cannot find the self confidence，getting trouble in the relationships and other kinds of pressure."	B_S0
"If we try to find the connection between this phenomenon and the reason，it is not hard to draw a conclution that we are too young to solve our emotion problems."	I_S0
"Most of us were told to be hardwork in school and get good grades,so that we can create our good life,but no one tell us how to get well with ourselves,how to deal with our emotion and how to face the distance from aim to reality,these are what we really need to lead our lives,and not be leaded by the social situation."	I_S0
"Once I have been a hard time just like this,and fortunately I get through of it,and here are some experience for some students who are suffering this difficult time."	I_S0
"First,take a long rest,calm down and take a deep thinking,answer ourselves:'What makes us feel anxiety？',find the answer and face it,no matter how terrible it is."	I_S0
"Second,you can try to make a list to write down the methods which could help you to find the solve the problems,it does not need to handle the problems correctly,but it can give you clear way to lead you break through the hardship just like chatting with your teacher，reading some books or ask your question on line."	I_S0
"Last but not least,find the most suitable answer and just do it."	I_S0
"I known"	E_S0
 
"I think there could be some reasons that can explain this and several measures can be adopted to went up dramatically over the last three decades."	B_I0
"It automatically leads to the traffic congestion in cities in many countries of the world."	E_I0
"We cannot limit the number of car possessions to deal with this issue."	S_T1
"Therefore, the government should think about some solutions to persuade people to refrain from using their own transport in order to reduce the traffic jam."	S_M1
"There are solutions to the problem."	B_S0
"Public transport infrastructure, such as rail, is currently being constructed in Saigon to offer a viable alternative to commuting on the road."	I_S0
"Further to this, the cost of registering a motor vehicle is high which tends to discourage the general public from using cars."	E_S0
"In my opinion, there are several actions that government can take to settle from this complicated problem."	S_M1
"Firstly, whilst the vehicle companies produce their cars, the government should build and develop the road infrastructure in order to give enough space for many vehicles to minimise the congestion of traffic."	S_S2
"To conclude, transportation solutions are a major responsibility for town planners who need to mitigate the traffic problems resulting from the growing use of motor vehicles."	S_C2
 
"In my opinion, I think it's necessary to do some work in a young age for teens."	S_T1
"Nowadays, more and more kids study whole day and always stay at home or school."	B_S0
"They don't have enough experience in their daily life, such as how to cook, how to wash dishes, also how to communicate with others in the society."	I_S0
"These kinds of skills are very important when they grow up."	I_S0
"So practice these kinds of skills is necessary."	I_S0
"And let teens to do some work is a easy way."	I_S0
"Parents can let them to a small restaurant do some easy work such as wash the dishes, clean the table, bring food to customers..."	I_S0
"and so on."	I_S0
"They will know the easy rules in the small society, the difficulty of earn money."	I_S0
"And they may spent less in their life to save money for the family."	I_S0
"The biggest advantage is getting more experience of working in the future."	I_S0
"Everyone will have a difficult start in their working."	I_S0
"But if you experienced early, you may have more better opportunities in your future."	I_S0
"It can also pracitce the skill of communication."	I_S0
"It's very important, because it will make you a socialble person and let more people to know you."	I_S0
"The teens who studies all day may can't find a dream job beause they don't have much experience in working."	I_S0
"They are the first time to work."	I_S0
"They may don't know the rules and lose many opportunity."	I_S0
"At that time, noone will teach them skills."	I_S0
"They may in trouble."	I_S0
"The people who do some work in the early age will take easy."	I_S0
"They have many skills and enough preparations for the work."	I_S0
"So they always get a work what they really want."	I_S0
"That's the reason why I think do some work for teens is necessary."	E_S0
 
"Nowdays students are under perssure, students may have some diffcults on their homework or test,and some of them leaving schools with negative thoughts."	S_T1
"There are there main reasons."	B_S0
"First, the homework for students is too much."	I_S0
"For example: In china, most students leave thir schools at 7 pm and do their home work untill 12 or the next day."	I_S0
"That means students only have 6 hours too sleep,and they will feel very seelply."	I_S0
"so it‘s hard for them to study on the next day."	I_S0
"As a result they will fell more hard to deal with thir home work."	I_S0
"Second, the parents give too much presure, they will tell their childs that if they not do well in the test they will not find a good job."	I_S0
"And the parents will not give the things tha the students wants if they fail the test."	I_S0
"Third, some students are not good at the subject that they learned."	I_S0
"For example: some of them are no good at math while some of  them are not good at history."	I_S0
"If the students show no intersting in history they will no try to learn it."	I_S0
"The are also some ways to solve it , First we should let sdutdents finsh thir homework at school so that they will have less homework at home and have more sleep."	I_S0
"Second,use homework and performes in schools rather than one test."	I_S0
"have more than one test is also a good way."	I_S0
"Third, Let students choose what subject they will take in the test."	I_S0
"so that students can do their subject will."	E_S0
 
"In the globalized world,students do not have the only choice to study in their own country and more and more students are able to study abroad."	B_T0
"In my opinion,although there are some disadvantages exist,i tend to say that the positive effects outweigh the negative influence."	E_T0
"On the one hand,it is true that this situation have some disadvantages."	S_M1
"Firstly,some universities in their native country would lose some brilliant students who decide to study abroad."	B_S0
"For example,some intelligent students in some less developed countries prefer to study in top universities which situated in other countries because their countries are lack of advanced education and may continue to live or work abroad."	I_S0
"It means that those undeveloped countries would lose these talented people."	I_S0
"Secondly,some students would no longer study hard because they think they have enough opportunities to choose to study abroad."	I_S0
"Thirdly,the situation that more and more students study abroad rather than study in their country would have a bad impact on national economy."	E_S0
"On the other hand,it is no doubt that more positive effects exist."	S_M1
"Firstly,for students,they have more opportunities wherever they live."	B_S0
"For example,those students who have talents but cannot be well trained in their own country can be sent to other countries which have professional educational system."	I_S0
"Secondly,this situation would increase culture diversity."	I_S0
"For example,there are different people from different countries who study in one university and they can learn various culture via study together."	I_S0
"Thirdly,it also can promote exchanges among countries."	E_S0
"In conclusion,although the opportunity for students to study abroad would bring some negative influence,i think the advantages are more than disadvantages."	S_C2
 
"The map shows two proposed locations (S1 and S2) for a new supermarket for the town of Garlsdon
  The first potential location (S1) is outside the town itself, and is sited just off the main road to the town of Hindon, lying 12 kms to the north-west."	S_I0
"This site is in the countryside and so would be able to accommodate a lot of car parking."	B_T1
"This would make it accessible to shoppers from both Hindon and Garlsdon who could travel by car."	I_T1
"As it is close to the railway line linking the two townsof Cransdon (25 kms to the south-east), a large number of shoppers would also be able to travel by train."	E_T1
"In contrast, the suggested location, S2, is right in the town centre, which would be good for local residents."	S_M2
"Theoretically the store could be accessed by road or rail from the surrounding towns, including Bransdon, but as the central area is a no-traffic zone, cars would be unable to park and access would be difficult."	B_S2

charges my mood more than my job for the following reasons."	E_T0

"On the contrary, what happens in the job is not an important thing, because we know this is our duty so that it cannot dominate our mood, while social life is people's real life, so they can be affected when they face the living problems."	I_S0

"Dispute they only know that they can use money to buy staffs which they want to buy."	B_S0
"Moreover, they will slowly recogenize that they can use money to buy anything in their lives, such as snacks, toys and so on."	I_S0
"And if their parents never stop to give them money if they obtain good scores, they will realize they can get money if they get higher scores."	I_S0
"Constantly, they become more likely depend on money, and all they want are just high scores."	E_S0
"Meanwhile, if they know that using high grade can exchange in money , they will cheat to their parents by using fake grades."	S_M0

"While the reading passage suggests that the strange noises were actually the calls of male and female ocra whales, in the lecture, the professor told that it's unlikely to be ocra whales."	B_I0
"The first reason is that whales are usually in the ocean near the surface, not in the deep down the sea."	I_I0
"And because Russian submarines are in deep down the sea, they can not hear the sound near surface."	E_I0
"And if there are whales there, sonar can detect them."	S_T0
"According to the reading passage, the second idea is that the sounds were caused by giant squid."	S_M1
"However, the professor mentioned that the sounds started first in the 1960s and disappeared two decades later, in 1980s."	B_S1
"If it's because of the giant squid, it won't be likely to start and stop suddenly."	E_S1

"She was being shouted at for not having a good manner."	I_S0
"She still remember the events and said they are beneificial to her life."	I_S0
"However, when she teaches me to keep my manners, I always need to be reminded many times."	E_S0
"The second reason for parents to let children make mistakes is that if children make few mistakes, they will not know what to do when they face a difficulty when they grow up."	S_M0
"Parents should not only let children learn from the mistake itself, but also to learn that faliure occours sometimes, and the best way is to overcome them because nobody can help."	S_S2
"Thirdly, Letting children learn from mistakes is a good way to help them develop thinking skills to reflect and conclude."	S_M0
"The skill is exceptionally important."	B_S1
"When a child makes a mistake, parents should help them how to avoid such mistakes next time, and so he child can avoid the same kind of mistake."	E_S1
"In conclusion, parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes because that is a most efficient way to teach."	B_C0
"It can also help children get stronger and help them have the abiliey to reflect on that they have learned."	I_C0

"Especially in some transnational corporations like GOOGLE, FACEBOOK, etc, employees who are required to work in abroad have to spend some time on learning the local language and culture."	B_S0
"What's more, the increasing number of tourists has been the major GDP distributor in many traveling countries."	I_S0
"It is reasonable to say that most people study a new language for traveling and working."	E_S0
"On the other hand, not all people have their own accuracy and clear goals for studying a new language."	S_M1
"Some people may enjoy the sense of knowing a new culture which is brought by a new language."	B_S0

"But I don't think it's the best way to solve this problom ."	S_M1
"As we all know , fast food is not only a choice for  overweight peaple ,also for people such as student,people who don't know how to cook or ofice workers ."	B_S0
"So if  the government to  impose a higher tax on this kind of food ，it means the price of the food will be higher ."	I_S0
"After that , I think there will soon come up with some new problems , such as there will be lot of people complian about this action and maybe only a few  people will chose to eat fast food  because of the price ."	E_S0
"For me I think the best solution for this problem is to establish a special club for these over weight people ."	S_M1
"In the club volunteers will explain food's nutrition , such as fruits and vagetables will make us keep healthy , suger and meat will make us get fat quickly ."	B_S0
"Otherwise they can do some  easy sport together , such as jogging cycling simming and so on ."	I_S0
"That's all good for them and not to influence other people ."	E_S0
