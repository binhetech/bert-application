11.0	Whether or not parents should let children makes mistakes and correct them by themselves is an oftened debated topic.
12.0	While many people confirm that children should be avoided being exposed to the environment filled with challenge and risks,I do not believe that this is the case.
11.0	I definitely believe children need to learn something from their past experience,being punished and then correct mistakes deliberately.
5.0	Firstly,children have a deep impression on what they have gone through.
8.0	The area of thoughts in childrens' mind is somewhere parents cannot get involved in.
8.0	So how to make a reinforcement on what they have learned?
8.0	According to Edward.L.Skinner and other behaviorists,all the animals ,included human beings, can learn from trial-and-error learning.
8.0	When a person makes mistakes while handling a difficult task, he will less likely to make the same mistakes.
8.0	There are many experiments that gave us the same result.
8.0	It is absolutely clear that the result is replicable.
8.0	I once failed to pass my math exam.
5.0	As a result of this, I worked harder on the skills of dealing with math problem.
10.0	Finally, I didn't make the same fault.
0.0	Last but not the least,parents are necessary to provide children with more chances of broading the horizon.
0.0	There are many difference between children from China and those from America.
0.0	It may due to the culture differences.
0.0	However, it depends more of the method of nurturing.
9.0	Children in China were cared by their parents so well that they sometimes fail to understand what they really want.
9.0	They spend most nof their time doing homework.
7.0	Comparing to them, English
3.0	In this day and age, it is commonly acknowledged that a stable job can always bring a secure and successful future, which also is the dream goal of everyone in the society.
12.0	Certainly, some people thinks that it is easier to indentify what kind of job can lead a successful future rather than nowadays because there were less choices.
12.0	However, I disagree with this statement, and my opinions will prove this in several aspects.
6.0	First of all, people are difficult to identify if the job can lead them a better future due to the career varity in the past.
8.0	There are various jobs and careers in the sociey through fast developement.
8.0	Thus, in current period, people can have more opportunities to choose careers.
8.0	However, in the past, there are few types of jobs can be supported, and it is undoubtly harder for people to choose jobs because it is unflexible to have other chioces.
8.0	For example, A comapny is hiring a designer, in fact, this company just want to employee a computer
12.0	In the day adn age, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people: teachers' salary should or not same as doctors, lawyers or business leaders are paid.
3.0	Opinions vary from person to person.
12.0	Some claim that teachers cannot have higher  salary.
10.0	However, contrary to their view comes my perspective that teachers are worth to get higher salary.
12.0	My point can be elaborated as follows.
6.0	Firstly, being teacher is very tiring, so teachers can get as much as doctors, lawyers or business leaders are paid.
8.0	To be more specific, because of teachers are the most important role on education.
8.0	So they deserve the government to pay them so much.
8.0	Moreover, because doctors and lawyers are also very tired, but they have high salaries, so the government should give them the same treatment and let teachers get high salaries too.
8.0	For example,
3.0	Nowadays, more people are talking about the word '' independent''.
3.0	At this time , young people mostly no longer rely on their parents to make decisions for them.
11.0	In my opinion, the two reasons of the change is the change of laws and the change of people views.
6.0	Firstly,in the past , all the law said that young people belong to their family and parents should make descisions for them.
8.0	At that time, the law gave parents the highest power in their family, and young people has no free to make their own decisions.
8.0	If they make different decisions from their parents and they have an arguement, the law will support parents.
8.0	However, nowadays, when a young person has an arguement with parents, the law force will doubt the parents first.
8.0	The change of laws helps young people make their own decisions.
10.0	Secondly,
3.0	The phenominum of giving school-age children money has been discussed widely, some people think it's a good idea, others think it's inappropriate.
12.0	From my point of view, offering mooney to school-age children has some disadvantages such as children wil misunderstand why do they study and they will be unpopular in class.
5.0	First, children will misunderstand why do they study if parents give them money for high grade.
8.0	They will gradually study for money.
8.0	Actually what parents should do is seting up a right model of value so that their children will know they study for themselves.
8.0	As a result, children will realize they are studying for their future.
8.0	For instance, my friend Mike told me his parents always bought him his favorate toys when he got a good grade in high school.
8.0	When he graduated from high school, he found out he learned nothing because what he did in high school was persuing the high score.
8.0	He ignored the knowledge itself so he started to worry about his future.
8.0	As a result, he has no job now.
8.0	he was fired by many companies because he was not good even one thing.
5.0	Furthermore, children will be unpopular in class if their parents give them money.
8.0	Children will develop a bad habbit if their parents are insisting to give them money for high grade.
8.0	No matter what they do, they consider about the profit first.
8.0	such kind of people won't be popular in a group.
8.0	Here is an example of mine, when I studied in middle school, my grade was good and my parents liked to give me money when I got good grade.
8.0	Later I became very mean and unpopular.
8.0	The reason was when other kids asked me to help them, I always tell them do not ask me for help unless giving me a candy.
8.0	Then other kids didn't asked for help anymore.
8.0	Nobody even talked with me.
8.0	I feel lonely in class.
8.0	One day I write letters to every single child in class.
8.0	In the letter, I said I will give you a candy if you ask me for help.
8.0	Everything was changed.
8.0	I became more friendly and popular.
2.0	To sum up, although giving money to children who get high grade in school has benifit like motivating studetns for pursuing better grade, I still think it is not a good idea.
3.0	With the development of science and technology, people have more methods to kill time, and they have lots of ways to make friends.
3.0	But more and more people like to ask their friends, are you happy today.
3.0	The answer always is negtive.
11.0	In my perspective, I think although the world is changing quickly, but the happiness of human is deceasing.
12.0	My reasons and examples are given below.
5.0	First of all, for the kids, they have much pressure in studying than before, so they are less happy than the kids in the past.
8.0	More parents today want their children to behave well in school and get good grades.
8.0	Even they want their children to be elites and get outstanding achievements.
8.0	As a result, the children get more and more expection from their parents, so that they lost themselves in their childhood.
8.0	However in the past, parents hadlow stantards for their children's education and they only hoped their children could grow up healthily.
8.0	Hence kids could have childhood.
8.0	time at that time.
8.0	A good case in point, nowadays, there are some school which are opened for the preschool students.
8.0	The youngest kids there are only 2 years old.
8.0	Their parents send them there to study painting, piano or something else.
5.0	Secondly, for the adult, they are worried more things than before, so they have less happiniess.
8.0	With the develpment of economy, the price of everything becomes higher and higher.
8.0	And adults have to support the whole family.
8.0	They have think out ways to earn more money.
8.0	In addition, they have to take care of their children, they have to bring their children to the greatest school in that city, and give them sufficient nutrition.
8.0	Plus, the adults need to take care of parents.
8.0	If their parents are ill, they should spend money to treat parents and spare time to take care of parents.
8.0	For example, there are lots of young couple are depressed and have no vigorous to work, because they think they cannot earn enough money for their child and parents.
8.0	And they are too busy to accompany with their family.
8.0	In contrast, in the past, people did not need to pay the high expense of the house and did not to select the most suitable for their children.
0.0	Admittedly, recent people have more devices to kill time, such as laptops and mobile phones.
0.0	But they still feel unhappy because they have more problems have to be solve.
0.0	But i the past, everything was pure and simple.
7.0	Above all, I think
3.0	Everyone will make mistakes in the daily life.
11.0	But how to point out others' mistakes in an appropriate way can be still a controversial topic.
12.0	Some people will interrupt and correct the errors right away without thinking because they believe that they may forget what the errors are with time goes by, while others may choose to keep slient.
11.0	As for me, I do reckon that we should wait until the meeting is over and then talk to the meeting leader.
5.0	On the one hand,  interrupting others who are speaking is not polite.
8.0	On the other hand, keeping slient will show that you do not care about what the meeting is going on.
8.0	Both, in other words, will make a bad impression to others who attend to the meeting.
8.0	For example, as far as I remember, I once took part in a math modeling contest in a group last year.
8.0	We had a discussion about solving math problems during that time.
8.0	In that discussion in which every group member should come up with their our plan, I was interrupted by one of my classmate due to a slip of tongue.
8.0	Because of that, I ad a bad impression of him altough I did not show my unsatisfaction.
8.0	Meanwhile, an other group member who did not say anything about others' idea rendered that group leader annoyed as a result of his indifferent attitude.
5.0	Secondly, pointing out the mistakes after the meeting can assist speaker to improve himself better because you have more time to explain your reasons why he or she is wrong and analysis the problem thoroughly.
8.0	My brother's experience can be a good example.
8.0	When he was in primary school, he was the monitor of his class, who should organize the class meeting in every Friday.
8.0	In one of that regular meeting, he used a very rude words to criticize one of his classmate when his head teacher standed back of the classroon.
8.0	But his teacher did not interrupt him until the meeting was over.
8.0	He, then, talked to my brother about how to treat others in a more polite way and why we should do that, which spent nearly an hour.
8.0	At first, my brother did not realize his errors.
8.0	But thanks to the teacher's analysis, it really made my brother behavior in a better manner.
2.0	In a nutshell, due to more time to explain and analysis your reason and not being so impolite and indifferent, I hold the idea that we should wait until the meeting is over and then show your ideas.
12.0	As some children become more and more hardworking, some part of them will get good grades and their parents will give them money for the award of their high grades which is a way of rewarding about their hardworking and encouraging them to do even better at the next time.
11.0	I don't think it is a good idea.
5.0	First of all, there can be a lot of ways of rewarding the children such as taking them to a trip or some place they want to  go to or buying some toys or books they like.
8.0	Giving the shcool-age children is not a proper way of rewarding because most of the children at that age don't have a perception about the money so they will spend it immediately to buy what they like instead of just use a pat of it and save the remains.
8.0	For example, if a child gets  a good grades at school and their parents reward him some money for his grade.
8.0	Since he is just a little boy and he just wants to use the money to but the things he like.
8.0	It doesn't matter for him to use money at his age, but it will promote him to develop the idea that once you get some money, you use it instead of allocate and manage his money rationally.
5.0	In addition, giving children money will make them think that studying and getting high grade is for the money but not for themselves.
9.0	In this way, they will not study independently and actively because their purpose about the studying is getting money instead of getting to know more knowledge and become a keen leaner.
9.0	If their parents will no longer give them money, they will be less motivated and lack motivation of studying.
10.0	Moreover, children don't have a idea about the things  they bought either are good or bad for them, they just buy the things which they think it is interesting and attractive which will lead them to buy something harmful to them like alcohol or cigarette or even drugs, thees things will affect their whole life once they touch them.
2.0	admittedly, the money does has the function which and stimulate the children to study but this method also has many disadvantages.
10.0	In conclusion, I don't think that the idea about giving money to the school-age children for rewarding is a good idea.
3.0	Nowadays, it is ture that the economy development is significant in the whole world.
3.0	A large number of people hold the view that goverment should put more attention and money on developing the economy instead of protecting wild animals and wilderness areas.
3.0	However, compared to the economic changes, in my personal level, it is more benificial to protect animals and wild areas.
3.0	Thus I suppor several reasons for my opinion.
5.0	First, protecting the wild animals is a significant way to improve the knowledge people gain.
8.0	The population of wild aniamls are declining.
8.0	Some specially valuable animals , such as, the panda.
8.0	The population of wild panda are fewer and fewer because of the increases of urban development.
8.0	People set the officials and farmers .
8.0	These huge factory took the wild place where the panda lived.
8.0	The rare animal has to remove into the country.
8.0	The data from a research shown there are nine thousands of university students knew the animal from picture and book but they nerver see the real panda in person.
8.0	Goverment should protect the panda in order to expand cicilians' knowledge.
5.0	Second,protectting wild areas is a insurance to the health of civilians.
8.0	It is ture that there are many enviormental pollution around the world,such as, the fog and haze that appear in China.
8.0	Chinese local goverment had produced lots of laws to protect the healthy level of civilians.
8.0	However, the rapid development of economy and agricuture reduce the clean air and river of wild areas.
8.0	The research was done by the Beijing university has shown that there are eighty percents of Chinese urban areas, the people live in the urban enviorment are easier to get sick ,such as, get a cold,than the people eho live in the countryside which is close to the nature.
7.0	Based on the two reasons, expanding the knowledge of civilians and protectting the health pf civilians both shown the meaning of protect wild animals and awild areas are also benefial for our socialty
11.0	In my opinion, I think it is better to do physical exercise.
5.0	Doing exercise can entirely relax our brains.
8.0	While doing exercising,we will forget something bad or harmful to our health.
8.0	Also, after that,we will of course swet.
8.0	And this is able to help us clean the body inside.
8.0	So it is good for our health.
8.0	For example,before big exam,we must be in great pressure,so we need to have a rest.
8.0	And I believe most of us will choose to run,walk slowly or even swim rather than watch TV or use computer.
5.0	Moreover,we having worked for a long time,our eyes should be very tired.
9.0	But watching TV or reading books cannot relax our eyes completely or even does harm to ours.
9.0	As far as I know, doing sports is much more different,because our eyes are watching the scene instead of the books or TVs。So It is better to take exercise.
2.0	In summary,it is a better choice to do exercise.
12.0	Currently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate-people should pursue ambitious dreams or realistic goals.
11.0	Opinions vary from individual to individual.
12.0	Some people hold the view that we should always persist in big target.
11.0	Nevertheless, I am firmly convinced that it is a better option for us to concentrate on realistic goals.
11.0	My view can be elaborated as follows.
6.0	First of all, realistic goals are more likely to be achieved.
8.0	To be more specific, realistic goals are drawn up by people based on their current situations, as a result of which, plan makers are pretty aware of what measures should be taken to realize the goals.
8.0	Besides, since people take their own capability into consideration when making those plans, they have relevant knowledge and abilitities to obtain they want.
8.0	In contrary, ambitious dreams are so distant from current circumstances that we might be at a loss of what we are supposed to do and finally end up with failure.
8.0	For example, my cousin once wanted to win Nobel Price when he was in junior school.
8.0	Despite his strong willingness to reach the dream, he lacked professonal knowledge and relevant scientific research experience so that he was totally at a loss about what to do.
8.0	Later on, he decided to focus on the coming high school entrance examination and prepared for it step by step and finally entered a key school.
1.0	Secondly, realistic goals are more fittable to the need of our society.
1.0	To further illustrate my point, our society is developing at an alarming speed due to the progress of science and technology.
3.0	How to be successful in one field?
12.0	bracing eager of challeng or not to imitate others.
11.0	Undoubtedly, all of these are highly important characteristics for people to be successful.
11.0	Therefore, I keep in tune with the fact that successful people always try new things and take risks.
5.0	It is known to all that lots of successful people want to finish some impossible tasks and challenges; therefore, trying to overcome new things and risks is necessary for them.
8.0	Musk originally was a famous entrepreneur whose dream is to protect world's enviroment.
8.0	In order to achieve this goal, he invents sun energetic cars which can operate like normal cars without use of energy.
8.0	Additional, he invests billions dollors on immigrant plants to Mars which is a plant with familar condition as earth.
8.0	This project is inspired by his dream to reduce the loard of earth.
8.0	All of these work he do are unbelievebal tasks for people.
8.0	Musk can go a long way like this owing to the fact that  he is willing to take risks and try newthings in order to create a better world.
8.0	Having a glimpse into this society, almost all successful people have passion to do work that others even can not imagin.
8.0	Therefore, successful people are willing to try new things and take risks.
5.0	Aside from this, successful people never follow others blindly and they always try to observe, which enable them never fail to find more new opportunities.
8.0	Chinese famous entreprenear, Ma Yun successfully create a huge internet empire.
8.0	Nowadays, by using this internet system, people can do everything including eating and shopping in home.
8.0	This huge success are supposed to contributed by his indepence.
8.0	When almost all bussiness man invested on housing, Ma Yun claims that internet is the future of world.
8.0	This way, he followed his heard even people that time totally ignored his new ideal.
8.0	He never give up and finally this new ideal seted up a enoumous business empire.
8.0	After that, he never stop peace and he still to try some newthings including machine.
7.0	To sum up, successful people always try new things because they love challegin
3.0	Children always need some rewards when they get a high grade in school.
3.0	Faced with such problem, parents often come up with some ideas to meet the children's satisfaction.
3.0	Some parents offer their children money to encourage them work harder, and other peoplr think it is not a wise idea.
11.0	As for me, I vote for that giving money is not great and even do harm to children's development.
4.0	First, children always don't have ability to use this money effectively or in right ways.
8.0	So if parents let children to manage their money by their own, they can't develop a right consumption mind.
8.0	For instance, if a couple of parents give their child money for a good performance in school, this child may spend this money so quickly to buy something they don't need at all because they don't know how difficult earning a life is.
8.0	Maybe they will foster a bad habit that they will never make a budget for their daily lives in the future.
8.0	We can see that there are many young people who can't save any money at all.
8.0	They are not awared of that they should save some money to face the emergency that may happen in the future.
4.0	Second, children may use this money to buy something that can do harm to their growth.
8.0	Having such a large income, maybe they will buy some books about violence or sexy.
8.0	They also can buy some video games or some books not related to class and spend a lot of time on it.
8.0	This will waste much energy of them to study hard.
8.0	And grades will dro
4.0	Finally, there are also some better ideas to urge children to work harder for parents.
8.0	For instance, parents can spend much more time to accompany their children, like chat with them or have trip.
8.0	This give a chance for parents to know their children better,such as what they are thinking and what they want.
8.0	Further more, children can perceive the love from their parents and get motivation to study harder, not only for themselves but also for their parents.
8.0	I do think this is the most needed by children instead of money at present.
8.0	Many parents don't have enough time to accompany their children, and this way can't be replaced with the money.
0.0	Put it into a nutshell, we can easily find offering children money for high grade is not a wise idea.
0.0	It may cause some bad influence on the growth of children.
0.0	What's more, we also have a better idea to give them rewards.
3.0	Firstly, having many new friends means that it is easier to find solutions.
3.0	Compared to small groups of people, more people means more helps, and more helps means more possibility to find solutions in studies, works, and daily life.
12.0	Less unsolved trouble is definitly pleasing for most people.
5.0	Secondly, being able to make new friends is one kind of social skills, which is important in the workplace.
10.0	One would get to know new people when he start his working career, and making friends with new co-workers are important
5.0	I admit that maintaining friendships with a small group of friends is truely difficult to achieve.
8.0	Some people think highly of maintaining friendships with ten or fewer friends for many years.
8.0	And they hold the opinion that a group of close friends can be the harbour when people are in troubles, because some private troubles can only be told to few friends who have been getting a long with them for a long time.
8.0	They also say that sharing problems would make them release stress in daily activities.
8.0	However those kind of people who maintain friendships to make themselves feel better would border their friends.
12.0	I think offerring school-age children money for each high grade(MARK) they get is a good idea.
12.0	Here is my opinion.
12.0	First,I think it the money that parents give means a praise and it can help to develop children's interests of studying which can make them pay more attentiong to their schoolwork.
12.0	Second,by this,they will knwo money is not easy to earn and studying hard and get good grades is a way to earn money.
12.0	Last,by getting money,children will sense that making efforts will recieve gains.
10.0	They will realize that NO PAINS NO GAINS.
6.0	However,eyery coin has two sides.
8.0	Offerring school-age children money for each high grade(MARK) they get also has disadvantages.
8.0	They may misundertand that they study hard just for the praise and the mong from thir parents.
8.0	Atually they are studying hard for their future life.
8.0	In addition,they may spend their whole days studying for money no matter it is weekdays or weekends.
8.0	They will lose the ability of communicating to other people or forget to join social activities All in all,I think the advantages of offerring school-age children money for each high grade(MARK) they get are more than the disadvantages.
8.0	So I still think parents can offer their school-age children money for each high grade(MARK) they get.
8.0	But they are supposed to remember to let their children the main pourpose of studying so that they will not misunderstand it and lead to some bad influnces.
8.0	Parents should try to fing a proper way to encourage children to study hard and get good grades.
11.0	Nowadays, people have more and more options to choose to relax and amuse themselves:some choose to do some reading or watch movies while the other are more willing to do some physical exercise.
12.0	When asked about which way is better, different people have different answers.
11.0	As far as I am concerned, the former option is better.
12.0	Reading a book or watching a movie can always helps me escape from the pressure.
5.0	First of all, the books or the movies are always available.
8.0	As the popularization of cell phones and computers, we can search the name of books or movies that we want and then just enjoy them.
8.0	We can also do it whenever we would like to do so.
8.0	The technology is so developed that the movies and the books can be shared to everybody as long as you pay a little fee to download.
5.0	The books and movies don't need to pay extra efferts, you just need to sit down and enjoy the peaceful feeling brought by  them.
8.0	Compared with doing physical exercise, these options above are far more convinient and safe to all of us.
8.0	I still remember the first time when I read Japenese novel called 'Yuki kuni', the magnificant valley described in this novel is so peaceful that more than one time, I have dreamed of visiting there someday in the future.
8.0	The physical exercise never give me such experience like that, on the contrary, the exercise is painful to me for I often get hurt during exercise.
2.0	Although some people think doing physical exercise is a more healthy way to live on, the books and movies also refresh and relax our minds and keep our mental world safe and sound to defeat any challege in the future.
3.0	Should let children learn to manage their own money when they are little in order to raise their sense of financial responsibilities?
3.0	This question always confuses parents those day.
11.0	In my piont of view, however, the youger the children learn to manage their own money, the more financially responsible they will be when they grow up.
5.0	Many parents  may ask what if children waste their money when they are managing their own money without the supervision of parents?
8.0	I have to point out that, to self-disciplined children, parents don't have to worry about their management for money at all.
8.0	Even to those naughty ones, thay may waste some bills at first, as time goes by and the limitation for the quantity of money, they will realize that the only way to get what they want at most they must have a logical plan on their purchasing.
8.0	And that will help children develop the ability on spending money logically.
5.0	In addition, we all have experience for saving money of breakfast or studying tools just for getting our fancy stuff.
8.0	And just recalling back what will you do toward the stuff which you buy it on your saving money?
8.0	Of course to take it more precious than what your parents gave you.
8.0	In the same way, let children manage their own money will not only make them clear about what they want and use stuff preciously, but also raise the habitats of saving money.
2.0	What's more, as the children's dreaming objects may cost too much to buy it from their primitive money, this circumstance will force them to step out of their comfortable zone and think of ways to raise money on their own.
8.0	The most common way was doing part-time job, and that's what my frien Bob did.
8.0	Bob was just born in a renowned family, and he used to never take notice ot the value of each dollar.
8.0	But everything changed when he was forced to do part-time job to cereive more money for buying his favorite airplane model withou support fro his parents.
8.0	Standing in front of the service table with almost the same motion, accepting the complaints from customers tamely, and so on.
8.0	All these tough experience suddenly lets him recognize how valuable each dollar is and how hard to receive even one dollar from someone else.
8.0	Therefore, managment on money for children could let them understand the value of money.
12.0	Nowdays, many parents may confuse about how to let their children know money in a correct way, or some may just avoid their chidren from being acessible to money to eliminate the possible mistakes during the process of teaching their kids about money.
12.0	However, in my point of view, I think it is very necessary for parents to correctly and appropriately teach their chirden about the advantages and the damages of money,and offering school -age children money as award for high marks is a good start.
4.0	Firstly,it serves as a great oppotunites to cultivate children's ability to manage their own money in a reasonable way.
8.0	They know it is not easy to get the money, so they will cherish the power they get to purchase the thins they want.
8.0	Maybe they would cry and beg for every toys they want before letting themselves take control of the coins, for they don't know the money is very limited.
8.0	After conducting this methods, children will start to learn to make some simple plans about how to spend their money in the most satisfying way, and stop buying things that they are not so fond of actually.
4.0	What's more,getting money for only high mark will get chidren aware of how uneasy it is to earn money.
8.0	Therefore, they may get more understand how much pressure their parents suffer, and feel more appreciated about what parents have done for them.
8.0	Behind a high mark stands out a lot of hard working, a large number of exercis at the mercy of playing and entertainment.
8.0	It is just like the process that how our parents support the families by working day after day.
8.0	When turely experience the process of earning money, children will know their parents better and thinke about do something for their parents in return.
4.0	Although some parents might hold the opinion that money is atempting, and many people who aquire a lot of money may  take advantage of it to do something bad, it is not the reason for them to prevent their children from getting acess to money.
9.0	Even if they do so, children will still find other ways to approach money owing to their curiosity.
9.0	So why not choosing a more correct and controllable way to get children exposed to money?
1.0	In mordern times, it is unstopptable for children to get access to money in an early age.
1.0	The best thing that parents can do is to find an appropriate way for their children, and offering mondy for their high marks is a great way!
12.0	With the development of the young children's education, the debate over whether television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed has been raging for quite some times in the contemporary society.
12.0	After weighing the pros and cons, from my perspective, it is a good choice to show the television advertising to the children.
6.0	First, television advertising enable young children to broaden their horizon.
8.0	To be more convincible, each advertising in the different area can enable the innocent children more familiar with this area, then learning more about this new thing.
8.0	There is no better illustration to prove the idea than the example of my young brother Jack, a 5-year-old boy who is extraordinarily clever boy in his kindergarden.
8.0	Every weekend we watch some videos in my room, and he never overleap the advertisement, as a result, he knows more famous basketball player according to the NBA-future advertising, and he knows some new movies by the movies advertising, he also know the social condition or some events acoording to the public service advertising.
8.0	So it not only rich his own experience, but also shape his zealous personality.
8.0	Obviously, advertising is a great oppotunity for the child to enrich their life experience.
10.0	Second, television advertising
3.0	Nowadays, the society develops so quickly, so all the success and failure are temporary.
3.0	It is not strange for any poeple to success and fail in a short time.
3.0	The attitude towards failure and success is always a heated debated topic in the society.
11.0	Some people consider success to be the most important and they don't accept other results.
11.0	However, from my perspective, we will inevitably fail in our lives, so the most important thing is to keep  optimistic rather than success.
5.0	First of all, to be more optimistic in failure helps people to keep working hard, and gives us the possiblity to reverse the result.
8.0	Many people look for success all their lives, however, when failure comes instead, they may lose all their hope, and will not be able to continue working hard.
8.0	However, temporary failure doesn't mean anything.
8.0	However, when we give up our hope, we will fail permenently.
8.0	For example, Steve Jobs once got fired by his own company, and lost all his status and fame.
8.0	But he didn't give up, he formed a new company and successed again.
8.0	He even become more successful after overcoming the difficulties.
5.0	Moreover, to be more optimisitic in fiailure helps people to stay calm and keep our mind healthy.
8.0	The pressure opposed on people nowadays becomes greater and greater.
8.0	We need to find ways to adjust ourselves in order to beeter adapt the society.
8.0	Stay optimistic can help us to overcome many difficulties and have a healthy mind.
8.0	For example, many young peple commit suscide because they don't meet their own expection and they can not bare the great pressure.
8.0	If they can keep optimistic, there will still be chance for them to success.
7.0	To sum up, we need to stay optimistic in order
3.0	Nowadays, in the cut-throat society, an increasing number of people want to have a better performance on the workplace.
11.0	Thus, they have the problem that how to do better in the workplace or how to perform better at school.
11.0	Many people suggests that people shouldn't do different things, because if they do too much different kinds of things, they do very few things well.
12.0	I, however, disagree with this idea.
4.0	First and foremost, from my point of view, when it comes to study.
8.0	everything actually are linked toghter.
8.0	Every subjects has potential relation to other kind of subjects.
8.0	For example, the math and the physics.
8.0	Some people may think that they are irrelavent.
8.0	However, form my point of view, they have remarkbly obeivous relation.
8.0	If you want to calculate the volume of a bottle, there are two ways.
8.0	The first way is to use differenciation in math and the second way is to use some complex methods to work that out.
8.0	And those complex methods need strong knowledge base about the math.
8.0	You may need to know how to use the GDC.
8.0	Thus, i think every subjects are linked together.
8.0	The learing of one subject can facilitate the study of another subject.
4.0	Moreover, if you study many subjects, you won't get bored with study because you can always find alternative things to focuse on.
8.0	Thus, we can concentrate on the subject we are learing.
8.0	In conclud, the learing of different subjects can boosts our efficiency.
8.0	Take me as an example, when i was in high school, i have eight courses to learn, and at that time i surprisingly found that i won't get bored while i'm studying.
8.0	Because i can easily find ways to refresh my mind and keep productive.
8.0	Once i learning literature for 1 hour, i found that i was a little bit tired.
8.0	And i chose to change the subject to math.
8.0	After i started to do math homework, i found that i wasn't exhausted anymore.
8.0	I found a new thing to focuse on.
8.0	As a result, i can keep a high efficiency of study though that day.
8.0	In a nutshell.
8.0	Learning different subjects is a way to relax.
8.0	People can still do things to perfect.
4.0	Last but not least, it's easier for you to find and meet your interests and do that well if you study different  subjects.
8.0	Because, the more the courses you take, the more kinds of experience you can have.
8.0	After you learning many different subjects, it's easy for people to weight the advantages and the drawbacks.
8.0	"Thus, people can find their ""true love"" in a shorter time."
8.0	After they find what they realy want to do, they can focuse on that project and maybe become a professor in that area.
10.0	The life is the sa
1.0	In conclusion, it's benificial for people to do differend things.
1.0	No matter how many things they do they can still do things to be perfect instead of do very few things well
12.0	In my opion, watching a movie or reading a book is a better way to relax than doing physical exercise.
12.0	Nowadays,the daily life is much more busy with the social development.
12.0	So threre are two reasons for the mordern people to choice watching a movie or reading a book to relax themselfes.
12.0	First,after a day's work,people are too tired to take any physical exercise.
8.0	However,they can relax on thier bed at home with watching a movie or reading a book easily.
8.0	Besides, most of people have the good condition for watching or reding in thier own house instead of doing physical exercise which they have to go to the gym or garden.
8.0	Second, It can benefit people's work much by watching a movie or reading a book because you can gain some knowlegde during this which will be very usefull for your work even or daily life.
8.0	Compare to this, doing puysical exercise can only make your body stronger which has nothing good for your work usually.
6.0	Many people may say that doing exercise can make people  healther which is very important for mordern people while the watching or reading at home makes people unhealth and fat.
9.0	But i say that is woring.
9.0	You can see that many peop
3.0	Now, the issue about the internet is highly debatable.
3.0	Some people think that the internet provides people heaps of valuable information, because people can eassy to use the internet to research the information.
3.0	other people  think the internet just creat a lot of problems, because the children will use the internet to know many bad information, so the children may have many a problem in the future.
11.0	In my opinion, I agree with the internet offer lots of benefits to people.
5.0	Firstly, lots of people need to research many information though the internet, when they do something, so the internet has a lot of benefits for human.
8.0	For example, when I was 15 years old, my teacher ake me to write a paper about the drug.
8.0	But at that time, I don't know how to write the paper, so I go to the internet to search how to write.
8.0	When I write the paper, I also need to  find some references about the paperof drugs, so at that time, I know that the internet could provides a lot of information for us.
8.0	If we don't have internet, I may not know how to write a paper.
5.0	Secondly, some people  say that the internet just creat many problems to them, so they think the internet is just creating the problem.
8.0	However, I think is not true, becuase when we use the internet, we should just control us well, and don't use the internet to gain some bad information.
8.0	For instance, one of my classmates always use the internet to search some information, but he sometimes searches some information about the violence, so after a few monthes, he becomes very violent and always fright with others.
8.0	This because he always doesn;t contron him well.
2.0	All in all, the internet could provides lots of the benefit information.
12.0	As is always the case, how youngsters are making dicisions is so much concerned that it has aroused a wide discussion.
12.0	People varing in different personalities as well as backgrounds tend to look at the same matter in diversified perspectives.
11.0	Some maintain the present young-generation is better decision-maker compared to the past, while others believe the past youngsters bear more responsibility and make wiser decisions than today's young people.
12.0	I reckon that the past young generation are better at making dicisions from the following aspects.
5.0	On the one hand, the young generation in the past tend to be more responsible and durable for their choices.
8.0	Resonsibility and persistence always lead to success in life.
8.0	Not everyone makes the right option but the thing how we learned from our choices is to keep it until it becomes success.
8.0	No matter today's youngsters or the past young people, they will face to the challenge of making choices in their life.
8.0	It is unpredictable before they act until they persist it and accomplish it, will they know if the choice is right or not.
8.0	So many young people nowadays are making decisions without much consideration.
8.0	When they fail it, they easily and quickly change to another option, because today's society provide them with so many opportunities to fail, and to remake their decisions.
8.0	They can turn to their relatives for help and restart their study or careers in a very short time.
5.0	On the other hand, young people in the past mostly were poor and cannot bear the high tuition of education.
8.0	Thus they had various choices to do others things.
8.0	In contrast, present youngsters have to adopt the nine-years compulsory education, which means they have no choice but to study during these years, which has become a convention and almost every youngster in China now has to obey this rule until they graduate, when they can choose to do what they like.
8.0	The society nowadays actually set a lot of hidden rules so that the youngsters today raely have their own choice to choose what to do in the first decades of their lives.
2.0	In conclusion, even they all have the rights to make their choices, the youngsters in the past have more responsibility and they are allowed to make decision about their lives earlier.
11.0	I think it is a good idea to offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in the school.
12.0	Nowadays, the pressure that come from the school bring lots of  influence to the students, so that students really need some different kinds of method to encourage them.
4.0	Firsly, parents give the money to their children is a good and easy way to encourage children and that may tells them to it is a mutual relationship between striking and rewards.
9.0	After they get the money, they can fight for their marks at the next time.
9.0	After a long time, they may have the behavious of hard-working.
4.0	Secondly, it is also an other way for the children to get their own money.
8.0	They can use those reward to pay for the things that they want to buy for.
8.0	It may also educate them how to use their money in a security way.
8.0	According to this, the parents may have the oppportunity to give them their own money in an opposite way and improve their grades as the same time.
4.0	Finally, the last advantage of offering the school-age children money for each high grade in the school, it may tells those young children how difficult to get the money and how important of hard-working.
9.0	After this, that may be a really good condition to let the young children really know their parents pressure and let the children to know more deeply about how money comes from.
9.0	That is also a benifit for giving money after the perfect marks.
0.0	In conclution, parents offering money can let the children know about how to manage and use the own money, how hard to get for the money and stop young children spend money too much at the same time.
0.0	Also, to encourage their school-age students!
0.0	It may not just only improve children's one axcpet instead of let them know other things at the while which brings a lot of benifits.
3.0	During my high school periods, a lot of students complained that homework were too much to be finished, which caused almost no assignments can be done with a high quality.
11.0	Indeed, we will be busy if there are so many different things need to be done in a short time.
11.0	It is impossible that they can be finished well.
5.0	On the one hand, time is limited.
8.0	The more thing we need to do, the less time each of them can be allocated.
8.0	As all we know, every success requires plenty of hours to accumulate.
8.0	It is almost impossable to finish something well in a short time.
8.0	For example, my sister, when she was a high school students, there are so many homework of nine subjects need to be done everyday.
8.0	She came home from school at 6 PM everyday,
5.0	On the other hand, handling multiple things at the same time will not only make us busy but also make us distracted.
8.0	There is no doubt that none of things can be done well if we do not concentrate on them.
8.0	For example, when I was a high school student, there are so many different subjects' homework need to be done everyday.
8.0	During the time I did my meth homework, I can not help myself thinking about other subjects' homework such English and physical exercises, because there are so many assignments left behind but it is almost the time I have to go to bed.
8.0	So that I can't concentrate on the meth homework, let alone review and preview.
8.0	As a result, none of my homework can be done well which caused me got a bad grade in exam.
1.0	All in all, it is very unscientific to arrange lots of affairs together, because we would be too busy to finish them well.
1.0	In this case, in order to avoid the interference of handling mutiple things, I suggest that we are supposed to concentrated on only one thing each single time , if we want it to be done well.
3.0	From my perspective, parents offering children money for their high grades is not a wise idea.
5.0	Firstly, parents misunderstand the purpose of the educatuion.
8.0	High grades only mean that you do well in this subject's test, but don't mean that you have the ability to put the knowledge you have learned into practice.
8.0	Parents should not only pay attention to the grades, but also should care about their children's abilities.
8.0	That is much more important.
8.0	For examples, a friend of mine gets good grades on campus, but he hasn't been employed by many his ideal companies.
8.0	He tells me tha it is mostly because that he is lack of practice experiences.
8.0	Parents should aware that the final goal of education is to develop people who can use knowledge, not just study knowledge.
5.0	Secondly, children will lose heart about their purpose of studying.
8.0	Chidren study not for money, for their parents, but for themselves.
8.0	To find their own interests, to help them better understand the world, to make sure about their own future, studying is a very essential part.
8.0	If parents use money to motivate their children, mabybe it will work well for a very short time.
8.0	But what about high school, what about college?
8.0	Still use money?
8.0	That is ridiculous.
8.0	Famous Chinese Sun Zhongshan once said 'I study for making China stronger'.
8.0	Using dreams and goals to motivate children is a better way to establish children's correct value system.
0.0	Last, children will ignore the grateness that they should express.
0.0	The grateness is about they having the chances to learn and their parents being willing to afford them to learn.
0.0	There are many children in Africa who want to study but can't for financial reasons.
10.0	Also their parents pay for their study.
7.0	Children should feel lucky and happy, not
11.0	I think people today are  willing to help the struggling strangers.
12.0	In the past few years,there were some people pretended to fall down when a car sped by and then they claimed that the car kocked them down,and asking for compensate.
9.0	But when the divers call the police ,the police determined that the driver should pay for the both the costs of medical attention and the mental hurt.
9.0	And although the driver is unwilling to do this,he actually had to pay for this.
5.0	There are also some people who pretend to fall down,and when a university stuent come to help him, but he said that the student hit him,likewise,the poor student also need to pay for it.
5.0	"Consequently,all the people in the cuontry said that thi kind of ""reward"" will be a disaster,becouse in this way people are not willing to help struggling strangers."
10.0	And it will also create a different world!
10.0	So,the legisliture has to create a law to protect the people who are willing to help others,it says that the helpers need to take a photo before helping people ,and this photo will be used as a evidence to show that you are not the guy who nock him down.
1.0	And now the helpers can help people because of the new type of law.
1.0	so, as a result ,the people,who pretend to be hurt has now chance to ask for compensate,and there will be a lot of people ,again , who are willing to help others,and only in this way, this country,will be a well developed coutry wit a lot of warm-hearted people,and it be able to copete against other country,and it will finnaly be rew
11.0	There is a phenomenon that some parents will give their school-age children who get a good mark in there academic exams some amount of money as an award, and thus, people's opinions about this are diversified from side to side.
11.0	In my own perspective of view, this can have both merits and demerits.
5.0	In the process of education, tools of stimulations are necessary.
8.0	No matter the praising word from their teachers' mouth, or the outstanding feelings between their companions, can both prompt the children's study.
8.0	But for some parents, there use monetary tools as a gift to encourage their kid to do better in the future exams.
8.0	In nowadays society, everybody need to know how to distribute their own fortunes.
8.0	A reasonable usage of money can bring more benifits and life experiences for people, especially those promising kids who are possible to become much more briliant in the coming future.
8.0	On the other hand, nobody can understand the children better than themselves do.
8.0	They can get something they want most, and hence the small amount of money will bring unbelievable effects on their study.
5.0	However, though, there are indeed some potential risks by offering the young kid with some money which is probably out of their control.
8.0	As is known to all, children are both immature physically and mentally.
8.0	They can be easily attracted by something which can possibly do harm to them.
8.0	With the freedom to dominate some money, they will get further access to the staffs coveredly.
8.0	So their parents play a significant role in ruling their behaviors and imposed the correct values on them.
0.0	As a conclusion, monetary inspiraion do possess its own advantages, but the underlying negative effects can never be ignored.
0.0	Parents are supposed to pay more attention on teaching their children to make use of the treasure properly.
0.0	Only in this way can they become much more subserviant to their country and society in the coming future.
8.0	In today's world, there is such a phenomenon: more people prefer to take a low-paid but secure work because having a stable salary is more guaranteed.
8.0	Understandably, people are more willing to possess  these jod like public officials.
8.0	However, I have a different idea.
8.0	From my perspective of view, a high salary has incomparable values.
8.0	My reasons and examples are listed below.
6.0	To begin with, a high salary is the basic support to life.
8.0	In our daily life, everything needs money.
8.0	If we take a low-paid job, we can just make a living.
8.0	Maybe we have to deposit money for a long time when we would like to purchase a good looking clothes and we can not bring our family to take a trip, therefore the life is pretty
12.0	Nowadays, parents are quite care about what grade their children get in school, thery believe only high grade can make students enter in a good universty and have a better future.
12.0	As a result, some of parents offer their school-age children money when they get good grade in their tests or homework, they consider that children will study harder for the money.
11.0	However, I quite diagree with this idea and this behavior may cause problem for children's future lives.
5.0	Admittidly, with rewards that like money, children will feel achieved, which can make them have more motivation to learn.
8.0	Also, giving rewards is very common in school, not only in homes and many students study better because of it.
8.0	However, if parenst give money to children to common, it can be very difficult for children to give up.
8.0	At the beginning, children will work very hard and full of enthusiasm.
8.0	However, when parents not give children money as reward even only one time, students may not trust their parents as before and their enthusiam will become less.
8.0	Because parents do not want their children lose enthursiasm on studying, they have to give children money as reward continuously and it is very difficult for any changing.
5.0	In addition, it can also break the relationship between parents and children.
8.0	When parents do not give money for even one time, children will easily lose their trust with theri parents.
8.0	For example, a phsycology research says that when you treat another person well and satify his or her wishes every time, he or she will surely appreciate you.
8.0	Nevertheless, when you not satisy his or her wishes for one time, they willlose their trust and even hate you.
8.0	To be the same, even one time children do not get their praise, they believe parenst do not give what they should give.
8.0	CHildren will easy to get angry and do not like their parenst as befor.
10.0	Then, if parents want to remedy, they have to give money every time and when they try to reduce the times they give money, children will feel qiute angry and even lose the enthusiam on studying.
2.0	Students may begin to believe that they study not for themselves, but for the money.
3.0	Some parents offer their school-age children money for each high mark they get in school.
11.0	It is not appropriate for parents.
12.0	It is the key period for children forming values when they are underage and study in school.
12.0	Parent have a great effect on this process of formation because they are the people that company with them the most time.
12.0	If parents just awards their good marks though giving them money, it will give children the twisted value that money is what they just can get from their parents and money is the most important beyond other things.
11.0	It will have a deep and negative effect in their long life.
4.0	Sometimes Parents are not willing to communicate with their children, get what children think and what they actually care about.
8.0	Instead of it, parents just give children money and ignore their feelings and thoughts.
8.0	This can lead to misunstanding between parents and children.
8.0	Parents may believe giving money awarding can satisfy children, and children may think good mark is the only thing they should pursue in order to getting money and even lead them to give up their true interests  and happiness from doing other things.
4.0	Although mark is significant for students, there are others worthy children doing.
9.0	Doing execise, playing sports, hanging out with their friends, playing instruments, all of these are benefited for children' s mental and physical development.
9.0	It is definitely a pity that children with high marks don't know how to fly a kite, what the apple tree look like, why dinosaurs extincted from earth and have a bad health.
4.0	Additionally, what children really what to get as a award sometimes is not money, it may be a time of company,reading a book with parents.
7.0	It is the time for parents to chan
3.0	I disagree with the statement.
12.0	It 's quite common for modern citizens to develop all kinds of diseases since we are lack of enough exercises.
12.0	I do agree that watching a movie or reading books can be a good way to relax yourslf but what we can ignore is that they are quiet activities.
12.0	All you have to do is to sit there and read or watch.
12.0	Nevertheless,doing physical exercise is compeletely a different story.
8.0	You move different parts of your body and exercise different muscles of your body.
8.0	Therefore, many people may hold the view that doing exerise is tiresome and do not think ti is a good way to relax.
8.0	However, after a proper progess of exercise, you may feel releved from the pain originated from your unhealthy life style, including sitting for a long time.
8.0	Moreover, appropriate exercises may help you sleep better.
8.0	As is konwn to all that mobilephones are playing an increasingly important role in our lives and many people play their mobilephones before sleeping.
8.0	It is obviously not a good habit but if you do exercises duiring the day time, you are more likely to feel sleepy and stop playing your mobilephones.
8.0	Meanwhil, doing phsical exercises is also a good way to releae your pressure.
8.0	For instance, when you are running  at a comparatively high speed, it is impossible for you to think about anything else.
8.0	You only feel the exhaust and you overcome it, thus you have s strong mind.
8.0	It is an effective way to release your pressure.
8.0	As you build up your body and spirit, it is also much more easier for you to face the challenges.
2.0	Doing physical exercises is sure to help you relax.
9.0	Moreover, you build up your soul as well as your body.
9.0	Next time you feel like wathcing a movie or reading, try sports!
3.0	In nowadays, people are more involved in competitive work place, which means our job markets challenge people with higher woking skills.
11.0	This draws gerneral public to a highly bebated topic:people should do one job for a long time like an expert or to embark on several feilds.
11.0	From my perspective, I think we will feel more satisfied when we involved in many different tasks.
6.0	Firstly, it will bring us a more pleasant experence to do different tasks in a certain job or to shoulder several duties in different jobs.
8.0	This is because  we can meet more challenges and in relating to this obtain more skills.
8.0	Take my classmate as an example.
8.0	Five years ago,she was a teacher in public school,everyday she did regular work for four years :to teach English to high school students.
8.0	And this lasts for four years.
8.0	However, last year she quited the job  and joined in the multi-national company.
8.0	Lately I saw her I was impressed by her energetic outlook, as she will shoulder more responsibility during the job instead of the previous tedious duty, she felt more needed and will have more enthuiasm to finish the task.
8.0	So she can achieve better perfamance.
1.0	On top of that, we can obtain more skills when we have different tasks during our work.
1.0	As we know, today's work place is changeable, which means you can never predict whether you will do your own major duty for a life time.
7.0	Every body shoul know the worker
3.0	Universities in many countries have long had group works or relative disscusion as a kind of education form.
3.0	Although all of us can not deny the significance of group work, wether or not this kind of study has much more efficient is still in heated discussion.
3.0	As far as i am concerned, working together can not exist without working alone, and the types of works determine the efficiency of the two forms of study.
4.0	First of all, group work is a good opportunity to make students cultivate the ability to distribute tasks to all members in a project gruop or in a company in the future.
8.0	Since information become much more complex than it was in the past, any big project can not be done by only a single person in practical.
8.0	therefore, it is a wisdom for a group leader to arrange different parts of the work to all members according to each one's ability.
8.0	Getting familier with the gruop work is in urge need in any university to make sure the students can do well in the mordern society.
4.0	Secondly, the types of work determine which one is better.
9.0	There are homeworks that must be done by yourself if you want to get practised.
9.0	For example, when the teacher asks the class to write a summary on the topics carried in a book, it is good to have a discussion on how to analysis the ariticles beforre everyone get started, but finally every students write their own and get motified by the teacher is a more efficient way to improve writing skills.
4.0	Moreover, some group work need a lot of working alone previously to make sure the time of getting together is not wasted.
10.0	Working together needs every member to say their own idea, which obviously need one study hard about a problem in advance.
2.0	To conclude, working together can not exist without working alone, and the types of works determine the efficiency of the two forms of study.
3.0	Currently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people: Library,police or bublic transportation in the economic crisis which one should be reduced by goverment.
3.0	Opinion vary from person to person.
3.0	Some claim that public transportation and police should be reduce.
3.0	However, contrary to their view comes my perspective that library is the most useless of all.
11.0	My point can be elaborated as follows.
5.0	Firstly of all, in the econmic, people will not come to the library, because all the people is doing their job and think how to get money.
8.0	To be specific, reading is need we have when our need are met, so when we are strugging to survive, we will not think about it.
8.0	On the contrary, if someone believes that reading book can have psychological satisfaction, then i will say, you get the psychological satisfaction but your physical is having problem, so this way is equal to wait die.
8.0	For example, there is a famous people called Zhuziqin, when the country become economic crisis, he choose to reading book every day, so every day he went to library, so the ending that is two mounth later, he was died.
5.0	Secondly, it is a easte to spend money on the library.
8.0	To be specific, libraries are large facilities, such as racks, so the government needs to spend a lot of money.
8.0	And nobady goes to the library, so it is useless.
8.0	On the contrary, if government spend money in the library, the other place will not have enough money to maintenance.
8.0	So it will be lots of opening.
8.0	For example, Japan is having a economic crisis in the 2018, and their government believes that to building library can strengthen people's confidence in life.
8.0	But it turned out to be the opposite.
8.0	nobady go to library.
8.0	So this government solution make a big mistake.
8.0	And it make economic crisis become harder.
3.0	Nowadays,many parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.
12.0	Some people will argue that giving money is not a perfet way to award,and because of the young-age,children will not use the money in a right way.
11.0	But in my opion,there are something good to award children in this way.
11.0	And there are two reasons as follow.
5.0	On the one hand,giving money for the high grade will improve children's motivation and beacome a huge power to push them.
8.0	Every children has the thing they really want which their parents can not always buy for him.
8.0	"So,when he get the money from his parents for the good mark to achieve his dream--that thing he want for a long time,he will rapidly realized that ""No pains,no gains""."
8.0	What will make him to get a better grade next time.
8.0	For these who got a high mark but did not recieve the money,he will lose the motivation to get a good grade next time.
5.0	One the other hand,letting children own money when they are young will make them have the mind to command finance.
8.0	We can not rudely to judge that children are too young to have the ability to use their money in a right way.
8.0	If parents teach their children how to manage money as a guider,it can be a rare chance to take a practice.
8.0	Everything has its beginning,it is the best time to let children study to manage their own money when they haven't contribute a stable mind.
7.0	Otherwise,if their parents don't train it when they are young,they can be easily influenced by other
8.0	Nowadays, modern people exhibit various ways of exercise for pleasure and relax during leisure time.
8.0	For some people, they watch movies or reading a book to reach relaxation.
8.0	For others, they perform physical exercise in order to be relaxing.
8.0	There are a lot of controversies on the better way to relax.
8.0	Comparing with watching a movie or reading a book, doing physical exercise could be a better way.
6.0	Doing exercise or going to the gym will only relax the body, instead so the brain and mind.
8.0	So that it cannot reach the true purpose of relaxing.
8.0	In the moment, most people want to relax in a more mental way than a physical way.
8.0	The fast pace of the highly developed society has been putting too much pressure on people, what really needs to be relaxed is not the physical body, it is the mind and brain.
12.0	Everyone has a dream including me, and I would like to be a scientist when I grow up.
11.0	But things change a lot when I grow up and thus dreams changes too.
12.0	There is a heated debate has been aroused among people whether people should follow their dreams even if the dreams are ambitious or   focus ob achieving realistic goals.
11.0	From my perspective,  I hold the view that people should concentrate on reaching realistic goals.
12.0	Here and some reasons and examples supported my viewpoint.
5.0	First, it is universally ackownledged that making realistic goals can remind us and encourage us.
8.0	Since we are focus on achieving pratical aims, we should make lots of short-term goals.
8.0	So people actually know what they need to do right now and seeing those short-term goals give us motivation to reach a bigger goal.
8.0	In contrast, if one just talk his dream every day and do not focus on pratical aims he should do now he would definitely never achieve his dream.
8.0	For instance, my cousin, who is a high school student, want to go to the best university in Wuhan.
8.0	I had a talk to him emphasizing that he should set a series of short-term goal like getting a good grade in math, reading books everyday and praticing writing everyday.
8.0	He accepted my suggestions and after three years he did attend to the best university, saying that he was inspired by his short-term goals everyday when he want to take a break.
5.0	Second, achieving every single goals can bring us a sense of accomplishment and easily to achieve bigger goals.
8.0	It is known to all that when we reach a goal even it is so tiny we would get a sense of accomplishment.
8.0	And this sense of accomplishment can bring us positive attitude towards our big goal, giving us great impetus to achieve next goal.
8.0	Therefore we could approach our big goal more quickly.
8.0	However, if someone do not set some realistic goals for himself he would not know what he had achieve, showing a pessimistic attitude towards his big dream because it always seems so far to reach.
8.0	For instance, my sisiter love music and want to be a composer.
8.0	But she kept praticing even forget eating without a clear goal.
8.0	So she finally give up the music.
1.0	To put it into a netshull, I firmly believe that people should concentrate on reaching realistic goals.
1.0	Because not only it can remind us but also it can bring us a sense of accomplishment.
3.0	A well-known revoluntionist in China once said like this 'If the young people are strong, then the country must be also strong.' which stressed great influence young people could have on the society.
3.0	Encouraged by this sentence, Chinese young people lauched ' the May 4th movement' and succeeded in forcing the diplomatists not to sign on the unfair treaty, which has a profound influence on Chinese future.
3.0	As far as I am concerned, contemporary young people won't be defeated by their counterparts in the past.
11.0	They can also have great influence on significant decisions that determine the future of the society as a whole.
5.0	Young people can have a great influence on the important decisions concerning environmental protection.
8.0	As is known to us, young people account for the majority of the Internet users.
8.0	To attract more users, companies should invent the products that meet young people's requirements.
8.0	For example, the young have been infused with the awareness of protecting the environment since young.
8.0	Thus, they show a preferrence to those environmental-friendly products.
8.0	As a result, environmental friendly companies will be more competing than others.
8.0	In order to survive, companies will turn to an environmentally friendly model and that's how young people can have influnence on the decision between the two models.
5.0	On top of that, young people can also have great influence on some technological areas.
8.0	As we know, young people tend to be more innovative than old ones, so they can come up with many creative ideas.
8.0	Take the invention of touch-screen mobile phone as an example.
8.0	Before the invention of iPhone, the phone with keys was prevalent.
9.0	Blabla....
9.0	Jobs blabla...
3.0	Recently, more and more people bellieve that seeing films and reading books is a better way to relax tahn doing physica excise.
12.0	Nevertheless, I find myself in virtually disagreement with this idea.
11.0	I believe that doing physical exercise is a better method.
4.0	Adittedly, watching moive s and reading books is a good way to relaxe.
8.0	When people fall inyo the book and movies, they forget their own sadness and stress and be relaxed.
8.0	But not only could people have fun dering reading or waching, but also peopel could learn some knowledge.
8.0	And in this way people coudl aquair the knowledge easier.
8.0	According to a research in 2009 done by Peking university, people could averagely remember the knowledge fome movies and books 20 days longer than knowledge from the class.
8.0	For example, I used to watcgh a programm named DISCOVERY for fun.
8.0	It could reduce my pressure.
8.0	Moreover, I learned some biology knowledge that I could surprisingly remenber when I accessed to high school.
8.0	Nonetheless, I still believe taht exercising is a better way for another two advantages.
4.0	Firstly, exercising could help people keep healthy and be in good shape.
8.0	During doing sports, people's body will secret a kind of chemical matter which could make people happy.
8.0	"And some people's organ could also be ""happy"" so that they work more efficiently."
8.0	And exercising makes people sweat to get rid of toxic matters.
8.0	All of this could make people free from diseases.
8.0	However, for reading and watching, people may get some eyes illness.
8.0	The radiation frome the screen could hurt peoplr's eyes and unproper distance between books and eyes could also make our eyes too thick or too thin.
8.0	As a result, exercising is healthier than reading bokks and seeing films.
4.0	Secondly, people could make new friends during doing sports.
8.0	When doing sports, basically, there will be competetions which give poeple more chances to get touch with others.
8.0	And in this case, poeple could talk with them about the sports and get familiar.
8.0	However, when watching filmes, people just talk with their friends instead of stranges.
8.0	And most poeple reasding book silently.
8.0	So poeple could hardly create new social relation druing reading and wacthing.
1.0	According to what I have mentioned above, I strongly believe that exercising is a better way to relax because people could keep healthy and make new friends at the same time.
1.0	It is thus highly recommanded that, if is possible, poeple could exercise to relax more often.
12.0	Nowadays, a revalent saying we hear is that parents should offer their school-age children mongey for each high grade they get in school,because if the children get reward,they will work harder.
12.0	However,a great amount of opponents propose the idea that parents should not offer money to their children,since study for themselves.
12.0	As far I am concerned,the latter points seem align more with my view.
12.0	Three reason was suffice here to support my perspective.
5.0	To begin with,just like I have said,children stuy for themsleves not for their parents.
9.0	When I was young,my mother never gave me money for my good grades in my school,she told me that you are working for yourself,if you did well,you would benefit in future,but if you did bad, it is also youself deseve it.
9.0	I always think about her words,and even now I entried my college school,I always study hardly,because I know I just do those for myself.
5.0	On the top,if parents always give children money when they didi well in school,they will have a feeling that once I do good thing,there will be a bonus for me.
9.0	But in our life,not in any case we can get bonus immediately when we do good job,children may give uo to maintain this things  because they did not get bonus.
9.0	We have to know many things only  we continue doing and we will successin the end.
0.0	Lately,high mark is important in school,but it dose not mean evertyhing,if parents give kids money when they get high grades,it is a signal that grads is the most imprtant thing.
0.0	Parents are beat teachers for kids,children will learn from parents thinking and custom.
0.0	So,if parents do like this,when kids grow up,they may just care about grads and money,some times they have possibilitiy to do wrong things.
0.0	I did not mean that money is not important,but we can't escape the fact that they maybe ignore many other important things,such as friendship,their really habits and so on.
11.0	As we know, nowadays the modern life is becoming more and more fast and complex, and some accidents will just happen the next days; we need to plan for our future and career.
11.0	Besides, we also need to manage to spend our money correctly.
11.0	In sight of these, planing and organizing can be the crucial ability that we must control.
4.0	First, we can never know tomorrow's things, so planning and organizing before is important.
8.0	My cousin's experience is jsut a case in point.
8.0	He needed to establish a group to do some reasearch in the computer science domain.
8.0	And when finishing tasks like this, the professor and the equippment is all the bedrock of the sucess of the research, so he could not control all the variations during the reasearch.
8.0	Then one of his group members quit and participate in another group because this group can provide better condition and professor guidence.
8.0	Thanks to his plan before, he still have some positive alternative for the member in his list, so he could address the problems very quickly.
8.0	But what if he did not make the plan before, lacking a individua's intelligence will strengthen the difficulty, as a consequence, they might just give up the research.
8.0	My cousin could not control the numerous or complex variations during the research, but he could make a good plan to compat the problems when he met them.
4.0	Second, we all will face the problems about our career and future, so making plans can help us to solve the employment problems.
8.0	For instance, the CEO of Xiaomi, Leijun has organized the plan when graduating for the university, since he wanted to establish a company, so he was sure about the empolyment he should apply for and the knowledge he should learn.
8.0	Finally, he established the company and have a huge sucess.
8.0	In his sucess process, we can say that his plan and organization for his career is a crucial ingredient sicne he was sure about what he should do to fulfill his own potenial to enable him to eatablish the company.
8.0	And his ability to plan and organize could just is the concerstone of his company.
8.0	By comparing, we can inderstand how essential the planning and organizing ability is to the young people.
4.0	Last, young people always want to spend money on the things thet like, so making a plan is better for them to deal with the life problems.
9.0	For example, I used to dedicate the moeny ont he things I liked, as a result, my pocket money was just run out in a few days because they are too many products that I liked and wanted to buy.
9.0	I could nto deal with the compellin
3.0	Having a glimpse into my life, almost large ingredient of my life is relative to my friends; therefore, friends undoubtely play a highly important role in people's life.
3.0	Which ability is more important for happiness?
3.0	To maintain friendships with a small group of people or to make more new friends easily.
11.0	For me, there is no better way to become more happy than making more new friends in daily life.
4.0	In the first place, it is know to all that people will enter the different condition in different life stage; therefore, we have to learn the ability to make more new firends in a new condition without our old friends.
8.0	When I was a fresh man in the university, I almost had no friend because my old friends went to the different university; furthermore, I fund that it is impossible to play the basketball and have a fun time playing PS4 with themusually owing to the fact that there were long distances between us and all of us were highly busy.
8.0	This time, I find that I had to make more new friends in order to make more happy moments in my university life such as playing computer games and I feel the important of the ability to make more new friends.
8.0	Similarly, when I undergraduated and got my job, I fund that my friends in the university spread all over the world.
8.0	Therefore, in our life, we have to enter a myriad of new condition without our old friends.
8.0	This way, the ability to make more new friends play a priority in our life.
4.0	Secondly, the ability to make more new friends can expand our outlook.
8.0	For instance, when I studied in primary school, my old friends both come from same city with me; therefore, we had the same tradition can likely experience.
8.0	In fact, I always felt boring playing with these old friends all the time since we always did same thing such as playing computer games.
8.0	However, when I made more new international friends including Germanies and America when I study abroad, Germany friends always took me to drink their traditional beer and America firends always tought me how to play tennis.
8.0	All of these things were new for me that time and they were really enrich my time.
8.0	To be honest, when I learn the ability how to make more new friends, I never fail to escape from my daily grind because of the happiness and fresh air brought by these new friends.
4.0	Finally, when you achieve the goal on work with new friends who have the same dream with you, you will fell highly satisfied and happy; therefore, the ability to make more new friends is more important.
8.0	For instance, when I participated in electronic forum, my ability to make more new friends enabled me to learn more people who had same dream, seting up a comuper company, like me.
8.0	Later, we gathered togather and overcomed sumless difficulties.
8.0	When I earned my first million dollars with my new friends who had same dreams with me, I never feeled hopeful and happy like this.
2.0	To sum up, it is more important to equip us the ability to make more new friends for happienes
3.0	From my own perspective,I think that parents ofering their school-age children money for each high grede they get in school is resonable.
11.0	In other words,it may be an efficient way.
12.0	Here are my reasons.
4.0	First of all,we all know that,if a man have something that they really want to attain,he will make up his mind to win it.
9.0	For the same reason,if a school-aged children want to win win the money so that he or her can buy something the want, then he should work hard on his study and involve himself in his study,only in this way can they obtain the things they want.
9.0	In the end,children can certainly be stimulated and encouraged which will make them study harder.
4.0	What's more, by this way,children will also learn that dream won't come true unless they pay their effort.
8.0	They will get award after geting a good grade in sohool, because they spend their time and energy working on it.
8.0	As an old saying goes,no pains,no gains.
8.0	So,in this process,children not only get a better grade but also learn a lesson of life.
4.0	Last but not least,this method has another advantage that children may also grow the habbit of managing their money which is a very significant skill for later life.
9.0	As they attain their money as their reward,how to use it can be a interesting question for them.
9.0	However,in the mean time,I think parents should also help and teach how to use it correctly.
2.0	So,that's why I think this method is useful.
3.0	As present, the Internet things such as the cell phones, online games and social networking Web site become more and mroe common in very aspect of our life, such as education.
3.0	The social netwoeking Web site hep us to send an e-mail to our peofessor in the university conviniently and the online games can also help us with study if you play a game where you can only raise your level or get awards by answering the math or physical questions.
3.0	Besides , by using the cell phones paretns can detect our conditions in our studying so that we can improve fast.
12.0	All above is something we even cannot imagine in the psat.
4.0	First, the online games can decrease the boredom in our studying and make it more entertained for us tha before.
8.0	For example, in the past, all we could imagine about studying was jsut sitting in front of the desk and reading books or listening to the teacher, and these things is so boring that we even didn't want to focus on studying.
8.0	But nowadays after the online games become enviolved in studying we can learn with more entertainment.
8.0	When I was ten years old, my parents bought me a machine to play game and only you answered the questions corectly the game pet can grow up.
8.0	And since I wanted to feed my pet so I studied very hard and then My grades improved quickly, which may be the result of playing the game.
4.0	Second, the social networking site can make us study in a more convienient condition than before.
8.0	For example, in the past, if we wanted to hand on the homework we did yesterday we need to go to the teacher's office, but now we can jsut sit in home and clinck some keys in keyborad then the home work will be sent to the teacher through the social networking Web site, which provides us with great convinience.
8.0	Also, if one child get sick adn cannot go to school, he or she can jsut take the lesssons and finish the relative homework in the Internet, which makes our study more efficient and we can learn in almost any conditions.
8.0	That's the development in education offered by the networking system.
4.0	Last, in the past, all our parents could do during our study was just sit aside and watching, and they didn't know anything about the children's conditions and which stage children were in.
9.0	This was very bad for the children's studying.
9.0	But now with the help of the cell phones, the parents can know the children's conditions when they are doing something else.
7.0	And thanks to the cell phones, the parents become more and more envovled in the children's learning
7.0	and they can surely do something for their children ed
3.0	With the great development of the society, the world is become more easily for young people to lead the future.
12.0	However, the situation is opposite in the past.
11.0	Because of the fast variation of the society, young people are more likely to accept the difference of the world.
11.0	So they can adapt the life more quickly than the old people.
4.0	To begin with, it is obvious that technology is most important technic in current era.
8.0	Young people can pay great attention on the new device or technical stuff when old people are still confusing the bad or good consequances that the new technology might cause.
8.0	For instance, the cellphone in 21 century does a great benefit for the humanbeings.
8.0	Many old people who are older than 50 can only do the simple function of the cellphone such as calling up and sending message.
8.0	In contrast, young people at the age of 20 can use the cellphone to send email, surfing the internet, photographing.
8.0	So the young people can adapt the new technology, which can help the future world more convenience.
4.0	Moreover, this variation also can be indicated in the marriage.
8.0	In the old time, the boy or girl need to follow their parents' decisions, they will help their kids to choose the mate, which the parents think is suitable for the kids.
8.0	Nowadays young people can choose the people they like to marry.
8.0	So young people can decide the people who will live with them in the rest life.
4.0	Finally, young people have much more influence on the important decisions that would determine the future life.
8.0	We can classfly it by the example of education.
8.0	Young people can select the field that they would like to pursue in.
8.0	However, they used to follow the parents' order despite they have their own selection.
1.0	From what we have discussed above, we can draw the conclusion that young people nowadays have more influence on their own future life.
1.0	Parents become less willing to disturb their kids' like, and allow them to dicide themselves.
3.0	Nowadays, student's education is increasingly valued by their parents.
11.0	Some people think it is wrong to give money to school children when they get good grades, while others think it makes sense for children.
11.0	I think parents should offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.
5.0	First, parents give money to children so that when they get good grades in school, their children will think that their efforts are recognized.
9.0	This is a way for parents to encourage their children to get their support and encouragement when they get good grades.
9.0	Parents use material rewards to enhance their children's learning interest and competitiveness, which I think is very useful for children.
5.0	Second, the idea that parents reward their children with material rewards for ding well in exams can make them rich and hard to come by.
8.0	Children's concept of money is very vague and can onle rely on their parents' cognition to know the importance of money.
8.0	Parents need to establish the right values, and at the same time let their children understand that there is no money if they do not do well in the exam.
8.0	On the contrary, if they do well in the exam, they will be rewarded with money.
12.0	Whether people can work much more effectively when they work with others is a heated topic between the public.
12.0	For example some teacher more likely to assign projects on which students must work togher because they think students will learn much more effectively by working together.
11.0	However, in my opinion work alone can help students to learn much more effectively.
11.0	The reasons are as follows.
4.0	First, If we work alone wo can learn how to study ourselvers.
8.0	Because when you work alone you have to search the imformation, write the paper and do other things all by yourself.
8.0	You can not avoid to do something you don't want to such as asking a stranger for help or writing down all the imformation.
8.0	That's a good chance for you to be more independent.
8.0	If we can work with others.
8.0	We might rely too much on other people instead of yourself.
8.0	When you meet a trouble you will ask your teamate for help instead of finding a way out yourself.
4.0	Second, If we work together the work has to be divided into some parts.
8.0	Some part will be more easier and some parts are harder to do.
8.0	Some student only want to do the easier part and leave the harder part to other students.
8.0	That will cause some problem and if you only do the easier part you can learn nothing from it.
4.0	It is true that work together can enhance your communication ability.
8.0	You can others work together, you have to learn how to talk with others.
8.0	But if you work alone you also have many chances to talk with others.
8.0	You have to ask your teachers, perfessors or even some strangers for help.
8.0	That is a good opportunity for you to learn how to talk with others.
1.0	All in all, I think it is better for a student to work at a project alone than work with others.
1.0	Thy can l
3.0	There's no deny that famous people have great influence, some people may argue that their opinions are more critical to youngesters than they are to elderly people.
12.0	As far as i'm concerned, it's partly resonable.
11.0	The influence is hard to be avoid but it's our choice to select.
11.0	After all, not all of the influence is positive.
5.0	Young people tend to be more glad to recognize and accept new things including opinions than old people.
8.0	As a result, they can be easily influenced by celebrities especially their idols which may ispire them and give them motivation.
8.0	To illustrate, Micle Jacson, the king of modern dancing, is a great example who has already motivatied countless young adults or even teenagers to chase their dancing dream, and Opera Winphery, the queen of talk show, also encouraged people with diffrent skin color from all over the word to be sinsere and kind with her great charactise and brilliant talk skills.
8.0	These  famous people's influnce on all age group are quite equal.
5.0	On the other hand,  the elder are usually more experienced so that they tend to judge more correctly.
9.0	Whilst young people may get negtively inpacted as frequently as get positive ones.
9.0	Some actors or actress smoke a lot, consequently, some teenagers who are big fans of them are likely to behave like that, that's defenitely horroble.
10.0	In conclusion, the
3.0	A lot of children in the school- age will get some money from their parents when thet get good grads in the school.
12.0	Poimt of me, I argue that give some money to children when they have great grads and behaver in the school.
5.0	Firest of all, this is a kind of praise and reward for the children, because the children get sense of accomplishment after studyung hard.
9.0	So the children willbe more motivated and confident to gat better grades at the last time.
9.0	For example, we see in the sea hall perform like dolphins or lions, and when the animals complete the required movements like standing or clapping, the animals are reward with foods,and they will konw they are doing the right, so they are more obedient and do better.
5.0	Secendly,theywill be more productive, and every child will strive to be the best they can be rewarded.
10.0	If there is a reward for getting some kids to work on an assigment to gather in a given amount of time , they will think about how to get it done quickly.
7.0	yjus improving their efficiency and the
3.0	One of the most obvious ways by which one can ensure a decent standard of living and arelatively properous life is obtaning a kind of job that is going to be providing enough income and be stable suffeciently at the same time.
3.0	In my viewm in the past, it was much more convinient to identify what type of occupation would yield a desirable future than is the case today.
11.0	I feel this way for two main reasons which I will explore in the following article.
5.0	To begin with, back then this intence competition in the job market did not exist.
8.0	To be more specific, nowadays there is an over supply of over qualified applicants for many job openings.
8.0	As a result, getting a highpaying job in one's field of interest has become increasingly challenging.
8.0	My uncle's experience is a good example of this.
8.0	After graduation feom a moderate university, he sought to work in a local newspaper as a reporter.
8.0	Having no prior experience as a professional reporter he was amazed how many offers he received from even some prestigious publications.
8.0	The reason for such a warm reception was.
8.0	Of course, lack of people who applied for such as position.
8.0	Consequently, these news organizations would employ young inexperienced journalists and even proposed courses to train them.
8.0	My uncle was able to transform into a proficient writer, earning him a worthy carrer.
5.0	Secondly, because of the massive rise in population and resulting soar in demands for almost every possible goods and services.
8.0	Companies have expanded their production capabilities while hiring more workers.
8.0	However, many of this vast entitles do not pay a high salary.
8.0	Thus finding a job can not  guarantee a relaxing life.
8.0	For instance, my cousin who is currently studying abroad had to get a part-time job in order to affoed his personal expenses.
8.0	Not having a work permit he was forced to get employed in a fast food restaurant for a while.
8.0	According to him the conditions there were terrible.
8.0	Mny wirkers including legally hired ones had to work extended hours whithout any benefits or extra pay.
8.0	Furthermore, owing to the fact that there were hundreds of individuals waiting in line for a vacancy there , most of the employees were paid the minimum wage, which was not anywhere near enough to provide for a sigle person's expense in a month.
1.0	In sum, I hold the view that in this day and age, it is difficult to predict what kind of profession will result in a bright future for one.
1.0	Not only is extremly challenging to procure a job that gets you enough money, but als getting many of the available jobs will not bring a successful life.
11.0	From my point of view this is not a great idea it is harmful to students if they do so.
12.0	Firesly students at such yong age they are innocent and pure.
11.0	I can not imagine that what a person will be like in the future.
12.0	This kind of action the people who do it they want their childs to study harder and spend more time on studing this is not so good bacaues once you do it like that children will have a thought like money is the most important thing in the world but it is not in fact and they may also believe that when you focus on one thing you can eventually have a good result but in our reality world the failure is one thing that we must learn to accept.
11.0	So in my opinion it is better that you do not pay for their effort they have to know that study for themslef rather than study for their parents.
11.0	I think this a problem that every kims are facing they do not konw why they have to study and what is the knowledge for.
10.0	Comparing to the problem that if parents should pay for their efforts we should pay attention on the latter one.
10.0	I have a cousin who do not want to study in the past because he thinks that the knowledge he have learned is useless and in this way he does not want to study anymore but one day he finds that a star is shinning and he wants to know the reason and his mother tells him that this can be explained when he is taking a physic class so he is being much more harder on the project taht he is focusing on and he thinks study can help him to explain the university and now he loves to go to the school because he can learn knowledge that he can not learn from the computer game so he is a top students in his class.
2.0	What if his parents pay for his effort I can not imagine what he will be in the future so use money is ont the best way to solve the problem you need to let themself fall in love with study.
10.0	That is the best solution I think.
3.0	The issue of how many works to deal with at the same time is highly debatable recently.
3.0	Different people will have different opinions.
3.0	Some people think it is more productive to only deal with similar tasks during the work day.
3.0	From my perspective,I would definitely recommend to work with diferent kinds of work all day long.
11.0	I have the following reasons.
5.0	In the first place,different kinds of works will make us fresh and we won't feel so phycically and mentally tired as we site on the chair for a long period of time.
8.0	Since when i'm tired,I can transform the work to another,which means I can refresh my mind,so i'm more willing to work rather than to have a rest.
8.0	Take myself as a example,I'm a university student whose major as mangement.
8.0	I have learned many different subjects such as math,history,astronmy and so on.
8.0	On the weekend,I have many assignment to deal with.
8.0	When I was try my best to solve the math question,It's really hard for me to think out it,because I feeled so tired.
8.0	So I put down the math book,and  open my history books,I feel energetic immediantly.
8.0	I refreshed my mind.
8.0	At last,its really a happy day at least and I have learnd many history konwledge rather than waitting for the math answer for a whole day.
5.0	Secondly,doing many types of tasks can improve our effiency.
8.0	Because when we don't feel tired,we will do more works at a short time.
8.0	I still remember when I was high school.
8.0	I need to deal with endless task such as writing the paper,taking the class and so on.
8.0	I feel so tired and busy.
8.0	So I decide to do many works at same time.
8.0	It's really productive at last.
8.0	I get many high point in many works.
7.0	Alought working on one job is wliiing to be foucuing more,
7.0	But it's really h
3.0	Nowaday, many people think relaxing by staying at home watching TV or reading book is better than doing execise.
11.0	But I disagree.
11.0	Ithink doing execise also is a good way to relax.
4.0	fist of all, according to the News, many sports can help people more active, It similar with game.
9.0	For example, when you feel boring, not just watching TV or reading book, also you can do some sports such as running, swimming or climbing, to make your body relaxing.
9.0	As we konw doing execise can improve our blood liqued, It's good for your healthyand also can make your arm, your leg more relax.
4.0	secondly, on the one hand, watching and reading is a good way to relax your eyes.
8.0	However, relaxing isn't just one part.
8.0	So doing physical exercise is a good choice for relaxing your body.
8.0	In school we don't have enough time to sleep, I feel tired at moring, but luckly we have to do physical exercise before the breakfast.
8.0	So after exercies , I feel more comfortable and relax , also I don/t feel tired.
4.0	thiredly,If you watch TV or read book over 1~2 hours ,your body will damaged and feel tired and boring.
8.0	However ,if you walk for 1`2 hours you nver feel un comfortable, on the contrary, you will more active.
8.0	My brother told me, doing exerices  is the most important thing of the life.
8.0	not just for relaxing, also it can make you more health.
8.0	cousequently, If you want to be more relax, not just reading or watching, your body need more exercies to relax.
7.0	Watching movie or reading a book to relax isn't th
3.0	The above statement poses a hot topic on contradiction of people's personal enjoyments and responsibilities.
11.0	And the speaker tends to think people now are dedicating more on personal likeness than on what they should do.
11.0	I stringly disagree with this opinion because I think that to purse one's individual enjoyment does not contradict to assume the resposibility.
5.0	First, people nowdays increasingly enjoy freedom to purse personal enjoyment than before.
8.0	As the development of democracy, the ideas and beheaviors of individual are respected and encouraged to some extent.
8.0	For instance, students can choose any major which they favor mostly; graduates can participate in what ever professions they are instered in; citizens possess absolute freedom on press and beheaviors they like.
8.0	Briefly, people have much time and freedom to do their favourite things.
5.0	However, spending much time on personal enjoyment does not indicate that people ignore their accountability which should be taken.
8.0	Let's take a college student in art for example.
8.0	Generally, students in art major should spend much time on reading and appreciating art history, biography of artists and art works.
8.0	Yet, the student favors more on economics.
8.0	He probably continues to earn his degree on art with great interest in economic as well.
8.0	Or he may pursue a second degree on economics.
8.0	No matter what his decision is, he takes his responcibility to become a worthy student of his major.
0.0	In addition, to pursue one's personal enjoyment help to assume the responsibility.
0.0	People shouldd not be  blamed for their time spent on things they like.
0.0	Obviously, people lived in an time teemed with tense competition and they are often under a huge pressure.
0.0	After a whole day job or a period of work, you probably make yoursely to put tour heart in something, or go out for movies.
7.0	Of course yuo are mostly
12.0	Unavoidably, we may meet many problems in our daily life, and normal we can not fix it completly by ourselves.
12.0	When it comes to class, if there is someone who needs help, I think is a kind of my responsibility to offer my help.
4.0	First, usually I can offer one who needs help in a more efficient way than turning to a tutor.
8.0	Noramlly tutors are very busy, and it is hard for them to pay attention to everybody in the class.
8.0	If someone is facing a trouble and fortunately I am in the class at that time, I can give him a hand right away.
8.0	That maks me think of a experience of mine.
8.0	I was in the middle school and I was very big with fixing something.
8.0	Suddenly I heard one of my friends compained about her pencil case which was broken again.
8.0	I told him I can fix it and finally he got it repaired.
8.0	He was very appreciate that I solve his trouble in time.
8.0	He thought it would have been a big touble if I would not have helped him.
4.0	Second, helping others can improve my own skills.
8.0	Because one can get enough practice when helping others.
8.0	And here is an example of mine.
8.0	When I was in high school, I had a talent in psysics.
8.0	But as for most student it was very hard to learn and understand.
8.0	In order to help them, I spent a lot of time telling the knowlege.
8.0	It seemed that I waste a lot of time which have no good to me.
8.0	However, I finally got the first psysics grage in my class, which made understand that I can get practive when helping others and I will make a progress.
4.0	I have to admit that asking tutors for help is more official and sometimes more powerful.
8.0	Because tutors usually are professinal which means they are skilled to offer students help.
8.0	In fact, there do exist something students can not fix, so when it comes it is necessary to turn to tutors.
8.0	However, my friends who most are students.
8.0	Most of their problems is not that big, so there is no need to find tutors.
1.0	All in all, my offering help is more efficient and can benefit me, which is better than finding a tuor.
1.0	I believe helping each other is a meaningful way to help students to make a progress too.
10.0	I AGREE WITH THE FOLLOWING STATEM.
12.0	I think most of student prefer watching a movie or other way to relax than doing physical exercise.
12.0	And students should have the extra time to do what they want to do,everyone need have their own hobby.
6.0	Because the students in my country spend 70% time in shchool and spend 90% in study.
8.0	So I don't think they will do physical exercise during their spare time.
8.0	On the hand,if students study all day,maybe they will become stupid.
8.0	We know,the teenagers should become more creative,if they always concentrate on the text book or homework,they won't have any develop in other way ,just are study mechine.
3.0	With the rapid development of our society, it is universally acknowledged that the world is become smaller and smaller, the access of obtaining knowledge become simpler and simpler.
11.0	A heated topic has been aroused among people that whether  it is as vital as for the elderly to study or learn new things as it is for younger people or not.
11.0	From my prespective, I hold the view that it is certainly as vital as for the elderly to study as it is for younger people.
12.0	Here are my reasons which support my views.
5.0	First, it is conducive for the elderly to learn new things because they can enjoy a better life.
8.0	If the erderly people know more about the new world, the new technology, they can find numerous interesting things thus they can live a more happy life.
8.0	Reverly, most of our seniors are conventional and would not like to accept new thing.
8.0	Therefore they just sigh for the rapid changes rather than adpot those changes and become unhappy in the rest of their life.
8.0	I remember I have an uncle who do not like to accept new things recall its expericence all day around.
8.0	And I think he is always unhappy, because when you are stay with him you do not have a common topic to chat.
8.0	He know less about the world, like he do not how to use smart phone, do not understand the TV show and regard all this new things as boring things.
8.0	He just stay at his home and smokes all day around.
5.0	Second, it is beneficial for the elderly to learn new things because they can be more kind and friendly to us.
8.0	If a old person learn a lot of things about our young people, he or she may become popular among young people and be regard as a very kind and friendly person.
8.0	Reverly, We know that a lot of old people seem to reject to understand what the young man do.
8.0	And they are considered to be sophicaited and no one like them.
8.0	For example, I remeber a old teacher who love to learn new things about young man and he is so popular among students and students all think he is a good and kind teacher.
2.0	In a nuI hold the view that it is certainly as vital as for the elderly to study as it is for younger people.
3.0	It is getting increasingly more common that parents tend to give children change  money when they behaved marvelously in tests.
3.0	In terms of peolpe of distinguishing personal experiences and background, they would consider differently with this issue.
3.0	Those who attach significence to children's effort at school and the intellengent growth may speak highly of what these parents did.
11.0	However and undoubtedly, I hold the opinion that this quick-and-dirty tactics might have passitive influence.
6.0	Above all, the meaning of sending children to school  is absolutely not getting remarkable grades, but to learn to getting along well with affairs and other people.
8.0	By giving money, the parents unconciously educate their children with profit.
8.0	Child would realize that it is only getting better grades what he/she ought to do, but not also having fun with friends, exercising his/her own capacity of dealing with group activities, or planting the hobbies.
8.0	Nevertheless, these are all vital skills that the children should learn when they have to be involved in the society well.
10.0	Besides, this behavior reflects there are not enough trust between parents and children, while using the way of money exchanging for grades means their lack of communication.
10.0	This behavior is considerable in some way, however, in that after all the parents hope the better future of the children.
2.0	Thus, examining all these pros and cons, I would always hope that stoping this would have longer and better influence for children.
3.0	In my opinion,I agree with the statement that it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.
3.0	In the morden socient,watching a moive is a popular social activity.
3.0	When people feel sad or boring,they must ask friend for hanging out and watching a movie especially funny moive.
3.0	That moive makes people laugh,and forget what made they unhappy.
3.0	They only remenber the details of the movie,and they may talk about the movie with oher people.
12.0	So people always feel relaxing after they watching a movie.
5.0	Not for watching a movie can make people feel relaxing,but for friends.
9.0	People used to watching a movie with thier friends.
9.0	Friends will listen to you and give you some suggestions wherever in the cinema or not.
5.0	And reading a book can make you calm down,and think it over.
8.0	But doing physical exercise has a totally different results.
8.0	On the pne hand,lots of people don't know what physical exercise fit them,then they may do the wrong exercise.
8.0	It's not good for their health.
8.0	On the other hand,when people do much physical exercise,they will feel tired and have no energy instead of relax.
1.0	In fact,when i'm upset or feel nothing to do,i'll do the same thing like most of the people.
1.0	I'll choose the cinema.
3.0	the bike sharing scheme in less time can be find every where in wuhan.
3.0	bike sharing scheme this option let people trip more easy than before.
3.0	at last time your want to go to parkto play.
3.0	your from home to park have a distance.
3.0	if you chose by bus to go to park ,you will wait the bus then waste many time .
3.0	if your chose take taxi ,you may be think it isn't caculate.
3.0	if you chose walk to the park, you will spend many time and will fell tired before arrive to park.
3.0	but now you can use bike sharing scheme , spend less money wo borrow a bike,and can sit the bike any where.
6.0	first at wuhan ,at least have 5 bike sharing scheme business I found.
8.0	every bike sharing scheme business will let you pay deposit then youcan use this company's bike sharing scheme.
8.0	now, on the road bike sharing scheme most of them are anower to mobike and ofobike.
8.0	many bike sharing scheme businesses are died.
8.0	then have a question,if a bike sharing scheme company is died, I pay deposit to the company before it die.
8.0	how can I regain my money?
8.0	answer is you haven't idea to regain you money.
8.0	your moneny are lost.
2.0	bike sharing scheme can let  citizen life are more convenience , but many bike sharing schem stop where they shouldn't be,and inforlunce many people trip.
3.0	Since the younger generation has always been the focus of the socity, it is essential to have a discussion on who has greater influence on them.
3.0	Is it their teachers or their friends that affects them much more?
3.0	The perspectives toward this question vary from background and life experience.
3.0	Those who hold the oppinion that teachers have bigger impact on students believe that teachers are the most significant parts of a person's education.
11.0	However, others claim their friends are greater influential factors in students' lives for their companions are always treated as the closest ones not matter in their study or daily lives.
11.0	I tend to agree with the latter from the following aspects.
5.0	Firstly, teachers are most educational while friends are most influential in students' lives.
8.0	Friends are the listeners and paticipants for a very long period of a student.
8.0	"An old saying goes like ""your friend is just like another you"", which means you have influenced each other greatly so that when we see a person, we can easily imagine what his friend tend to be like."
8.0	Friends are not only classmates or your roommates who just come to your life naturally for the selection of a friend always takes much consideration and time.
8.0	You must be willing to learn and get suggestions from your friends.
8.0	However, teachers are always educational, though there is no doubt that they have great impact on our lives.
8.0	For those who dislike teachers' ways of education, they still have friends to turn to.
5.0	Secondly, teacher is an occupation term which indicates certain job in the socity.
8.0	When it refers to teachers, you may think about your favorite teacher in high school or the funny thing happened in your school life.
8.0	When it comes to the words friends.
8.0	What wiil you think about?
8.0	It will remind you who accompanies you to have meals together, who go shopping with you, who you turned to when you are sad.
8.0	Thus, firends are those who almost participate in every part of our lives, while teachers are just a piece of part in our eduations.
1.0	We admit that teachers are important parts in our lives, for they educate and give us guidance in our life.
1.0	But friends seem to play a greater part in our study and daily lives.
3.0	In the mordern society, parents are very impressive when their children get a good grade in school.
3.0	So parents might provide some reward to encourage their children to study harder.
3.0	One common reward is money, parent might offer their kids money when they get a good grade.
12.0	In my opinion, this approach is absurd.
4.0	First, as a student, money should not be considered as a very significant thing.
8.0	Their children might be misleading by their parents if their parents offer them money.
8.0	Because the meaning of study is not for money, study is a good way to improve their own ability.
8.0	When their parent offer their children money for their good grade.
8.0	In the adosolent stage, teenagers thinking are easily influenced by their parents.
8.0	When teenagers receive money, they might form a idea that good grade can get money.
8.0	However, this opinion is not true.
8.0	And this formation is harmful in their future life.
4.0	Secondly, offer the thing that their children need is a responsibility of parents.
8.0	If their children are not good at study, parents still have to provide the necessaties their children need.
8.0	Also, teenagers are not good at manage those money.
8.0	Sometimes they might spend those money in some harmful field such as video games and gambling and so on.
8.0	As evryone know, this is harmful for their growth.
8.0	So, parent should avoid this and form a good sense of money to their child.
4.0	Grantedly, money is an attractive reward for school-age children.
8.0	Every children have their hobby.
8.0	Their might be something they are really want and need some money to purchase it.
8.0	However, parents can avoid this by directly buy the thing for their child rather than provide money.
8.0	In this way, bod between family members are strengthened, and the sense of money is not that important among this.
8.0	Children will consider this just as an gift instead of money.
0.0	All in all, parent should not offer school-age children money for their good grade.
0.0	In this age, children did not form the sense of money and cannot manage money well.
0.0	So parent should lead their children to the right sense of money and teach them how to manage money.
3.0	In contemporary society, people are more pay attention to children's educating ways.
12.0	And the education is very significant for children to grow up.
11.0	And some people believed that parents should give children money if they get a high grade.
11.0	I convince that statement is great for children to study and growth.
5.0	Firstly, this is a great motivation system for children.
8.0	If children can earn some money from parents through they get great grads in school, that will encourage them study better and have aim to do the best.
8.0	Taking my uncle' son for a example, firstly his son is not good at study, and always get normal grade or lower grade in class.
8.0	And my uncle is worry about, and then he find he need to find something to encourage his son.
8.0	And give some motivation for his son.
8.0	His son love to playing games and some games will use money, so his son will ask money for him.
8.0	And he decided if his son get high grade, he will give some money.
8.0	And then his son did it because ha
5.0	Secondly, parents give their children some money and then can help children to study how to manage the money.
8.0	That is a wonderful way to help children estabilshe right value of money, and also can impove the relationship with their children.
8.0	For instance, when I was young, my parents will give me a little money for prize me get the No.1 in school.
8.0	However, I am so young, I didn't know how to use the money.
8.0	And then my father told me that I can use the money to do many things, such as buy books, buy some little gifts for grandparents or friends, or save the money into the bank.
8.0	From my father's introduce, gradually I can manage my money more science and more grate.
8.0	So parents give some to children for prize them can also help them to manage the money.
0.0	Admittedly, parents offer some money to children for each high grade they get in school, but also having some problems.
0.0	If children always cannot get high grade in school and then they canno get some prize, they will lose heart, and they will not study well.
0.0	So sometimes parents need to attention the method to encourge children.
3.0	As it has been ackonwledge by public, spirtual virtue is based on material conditions.
11.0	In my opinion, I hold the idea that people today are more willing to help someone struggling.
5.0	Firstly, with the development of social economic, people are more easier access the edcational opportunities of broad their horizons.
8.0	After being high-educated, people will be more willing to help the feeble and ashamed of deceiving the disable.
8.0	Lets take two comparative examples to further this topic.
8.0	Four years ago, there is an elder crashed to down by someone, lying ont the ground without any help.
8.0	Because crashing someone to injured contains much of deals in China.
8.0	At the end, the little girl has passed and this accidence has been reported, occpupying the headline of newspaper and intringuing heated discussion.
8.0	Another example occured near, an teenager  stuck in the interval between platform and subway.
8.0	Lots of people suspend their working, coming to the teen and helping him out of dangers.
8.0	So people abtained education will start towards goodness.
5.0	On the one hand, now government are encouraging public to help the disable, launching losts strategies to reward the behaviors.
9.0	In addition, A man with a hot heart are increasingly occupy a high social status and others is more willing to make a relationship with him or her.
9.0	Hence, after being encouraging more and more, public are automaous to protect the feeble and fight agaist bully guys.
2.0	On the oer the hand, helping each other is our human's inner heart characteristic cannot be change by anything.
10.0	Becaus
3.0	In the university, many assignments are done in group.
3.0	So whether working in group can help students work more efficiently or not has always been a controversial topic among students and teachers.
3.0	Some people think work in group reduces their efficience and is unfair for them.
12.0	However, from my perspective, work in group can save a lot of time.
5.0	Above all, working in group reduces the work needed to be done for each person.
8.0	Admittedly, working in group adds additional events, including group meeting and dividing of work, and sometimes these can be annoying.
8.0	However, apart form that, students only need to work on a part of the program instead of the whole program, and they can still get to know the other part of the program easily from their teammate.
8.0	This reduces the pressure opposed to each students and still reachs the same learning effects.
8.0	For example, students are asked to do a presentaion in Engish.
8.0	If they work in group, they can divide their preparation into collecting information, working on ppt and presenting on the stage.
8.0	In this way, they can save much time in the preparation comparing with working alone.
5.0	Moreover, working in group let students receive ideas from different perspectives, so they can work more efficiently.
8.0	Working in group needs every team members cooperates with each other.
8.0	During the cooperation and communication, students can know the others better and learn from them.
8.0	For some difficulit problem, a group of people can exchange their ideas and solve it much more efficiently than working alone.
8.0	A case in point is that, in my Quantum Physics class, students are divided into several learning group.
8.0	I am lucky to be in a group with great atmosphere that everyone communicate a lot, so whenever I have some problems in study, I can talk with my teammates and the problem will be solved in a minute.
7.0	To sum up, working in group fits for the students nowadays, sicne they don't have enough time to work alone all the time, and they will definately work in group in the future, so this also help them better adapt  to the socieyu
3.0	Nowadays ,children all want a reward after have a good grade s in school.
3.0	Some people claim that it's reasonable to give their mony as a gift of good mark.
11.0	In my perspective ,I strongly disagree .
4.0	Admittedly , parents give money to their kids as a reward for good mark will motivate them to study more actively.
8.0	Of course kids will like he money parents given, in this case chldren will find that studying well will lead to a good consequence, so they will study harder to reach this sweet result .
8.0	Nevertheless, giving money to kids may lead them to be arrogant..
8.0	That is to say kids are too young that can't ontrol their happiness of owning money from parents,so they may be arrogant for such a big gift like money.
8.0	At this time they may be prised a lot and reward a lot.
4.0	Besides ,giving money to their kids as a reward of high mark may distort kids awareness of studying.
8.0	Originally, kids should be told that studying well is to get a good life and future,but if parents give money to kids ,kids will change their mind to a wrong idea thet studying only for a mount of money and reward from parents.
8.0	In this case kids may be dependent on gift and money as the only one motivation to study.
8.0	Alos kids may lose their original ideality.
4.0	Lastly, giving money to kid sis awaste of money because they don't know how to use money as a young age people.
7.0	so
12.0	I am opposed that parents should offer their children money when they get high grade.
12.0	First of all, school-age children are in the age of forming their world outlooks.
11.0	It is quite siginificant for them to acquaint themselves with the right comprehend towards money.
12.0	Parents should not equip them with the idea that money can buy anything including grades.
12.0	This kind of action is money worship and childen may commit a crime for wealth when they grow up.
5.0	Furthermore, knowledge is noble and it should not be asociated with money.
8.0	If a genius use his talent just to earn profit instead of contributing the sociaty, his abilities will be wasted.
8.0	History has proved that only scientists and artists that concentrate on knowledge can create wonders.
8.0	Madame Curie took mony lightly and obtained Nobel prize, while Edison attach importance to his enterprise and fail to attain the power of Alternating Current.
5.0	In addition, parents have other better choice to stimulate their children.
8.0	For example, they can bring their kids to the museum or aquarium, in which way not only can they consolidate their affection between family members, but they are also able to build up their childen's interests towards nature and history.
8.0	While there has been so many good methods to award students.
8.0	Parents need not to use money in the risk of so many disadvantages.
1.0	All in all, I think it is not appropriate to use money to force children to get hige grade in school.
1.0	But if parents truely want to estabish their children's ability of economy, I think they can buy some books of Mankiw or Pindyck before giving them money.
11.0	I don't think it's a good idea.
11.0	Because in my oppinion study is students' duty.
11.0	They should try them best to do the best,to get the high grade.
10.0	If parents give them money when they get great grade it will make students misunderstand the meaning of study.
6.0	We study hard for learn more knowledge and enhance our ability not just for money.
8.0	Maybe you will say we study for getting a good job in the future.
8.0	When we get a good job we can earn a lot of money,so we study for money,it's not true?
8.0	I will say 'You are wrong'.
8.0	We learn fund of knowledge to know more about the beautiful world,not just for money.
8.0	What's more besides we shouldn't earn money from our parents.
8.0	They bring up us and give the best things for us.
8.0	We return them our good grade is a matter of course.
8.0	We earn money not only for us but also for our parents.
8.0	We should have a greatful heart to thank them bring us up.
8.0	As parents you have to set up a correct concept for your children.
8.0	They are only in school-age,they can't distinguish the black or white correctly.
8.0	So you can't give them a wrong idea when they are young.
8.0	When they make them way,you can award them some gifts such as a freedom weekend,a preety dress or something they want but not the money.
0.0	To my way of thinking,we should tell our children maybe study hard is not the only way you can get success but as a student you must try you best for your life.
0.0	And as the parents,we should see the children's progress and give them some present,let them know parents are always support you whether you are a good student or not.
0.0	We can see you try hard and we want you keep do it.
11.0	I don't think it's a good idea to offer school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.
12.0	First,if parent do it,it can make the children snobbish.
12.0	This way is just to teach your children if you do one thing which can't give you money,you are not expected to do it.
12.0	it is going to make children pay more attention on the money or the repayment.
11.0	But not everything is able to get repay.
10.0	There are many things can't meature by money.
5.0	Second,it may cause students think they are studying for their parents.
9.0	Parent should let their children understand study is just for themselves.
9.0	If parents give them money,they may depend on it,and don't motivate to learn.
5.0	Finally,this way can't last too long.
8.0	Young children usually don't have a clear goal,as their parents,you have the resbonsibility to plant their interests in study.
8.0	You are not supposed to let your children to be the slaves of money.
8.0	You ought to teach them to be the manager of money.
10.0	In conclusive,it not a good way to give child
12.0	From my point of will, I dont think it's a good idea.
8.0	The children may study harder to get high grade so that they can earn some money from their parents, but to study itself is a self-independent action and parents can't offer money forever.
8.0	For example, a parent can give his child 50 dollar in high school,then what can the parent give to the child after the child graduate from university.
8.0	So what I think the most importent thing that parents should do to their children is to raise their children's interests in learning instead of just giving money.
8.0	From other prospect, offering money may not certainly encourage children to learn harder, instead, it could result to their increasing desire for just a high grade.
8.0	Sometimes, a high grade not nacessarilly means a good  ability.
8.0	It's  just like you can easily get high grade by just remembering every possible results of a question ,however , you dont even understand the results you answer.
8.0	That's why I think getting high grade is as importent as having an interest in what children are studying.
8.0	When it comes to how parents should raise the children's interests, I think parents can make the studing process more interesting and variable.
8.0	Such as parents can take their children to a museum instead of asking their children just to read some tedious science books or do many diffult science  exercises.
8.0	By doing so, children may find entertainment in learning things and the beauty of study,and after class,they may themselves go to seek for the answers without being instructed by the parents or their teachers.
8.0	This may not only make them study harder,but also contribute to their learning abilities in future school lives.
8.0	Knowing this , I concerely think just giving money in react to children's high grade is not a proper thing.
3.0	As more and more parents want their children get better grades in school.
3.0	They offer children money as a reward to incibic students study hard.
12.0	Sometimes the method play an important part in making good grades,but it has worse influence in students' mental.
12.0	Students will have a thought that their study is only for money.
10.0	If there were no money anymore,they will do not want to study hard no long getting good grades.
6.0	By doing that students will lose interesting in konwledge but money.
9.0	This is a fatal mistake in studying.
9.0	Because it is hard to make students put a premium at knowledge after they study for money.
7.0	To keep the
3.0	Everyone has different ideas about how the work.
11.0	Some people think that doing the same thing everyday will make them finish the thing more faster and become more skillful.
11.0	But others think that doing something different will increase their interest and make them more willing to do it.
11.0	In my opinion, I think that the diferent ytpes of tasks will make me feel happier.
12.0	Here comes my reasons.
5.0	First, I think the majority of people do not want to mechanically repeat their actions because they can not stand the monotony of the same work.
9.0	If they have the same thing to do all the time, they will get bored and even do not want to do it anymore.
9.0	It is good for them to try to do different kinds of tasks, they can keep their motivation and they can easily satisfy their sucess in different fields.
5.0	Second, doing the same thing all the time will lead to more mistakes due to the boredom.
8.0	And the same thing can not give people any development or progress.
8.0	It will make most people begin to dout whether what they do is meaningful, and gradually give up their work.
8.0	It even affects people's health and may cause people have low spirit and depression.
0.0	Last but not least, different types of work make people have a wide range of interests.
0.0	They also can stimulate people's potential in different fields, and discover the beauty of everythings in life.
0.0	When it comes to this topic, I remind of my experience.
0.0	I worked in the teacher's office on the first year of my university.
10.0	I learned many skills of communication and the technology on computer.
7.0	But I got to outsides next year
11.0	Nowadays, many people would like to do various kind of phjysical exercise, and they consider it as a good way to relax.
11.0	The tide of doing sports become more and more huge in these days.
11.0	Nevertheless, in my opinion, I strongly believe that watching a movie or reading a book is better than doing any physical exercise at all.
4.0	To begin with, watching a movie or reading a book can boroaden our horizen, and it can improve our literiture skill in a rapid time while exercises can't.
8.0	For instance, when you are reading a book or watching a movie, you are always arracht by the good stories inside them.
8.0	And just by the comperhensing, you learn many beautiful sentence or sences, and these could help you to use them in your future writing.
8.0	Also, for another advantage,  you can enjoy pretty views in the movies or learn many meaningful historical events thorught the good boooks.
8.0	At the mean time, doing exercise can only improve your physical level, and it has nothing to do with the knowledge.
4.0	For the second reason, reading a book or watching a movie don't cost any energy while do a lot of exercise must do.
8.0	This way usuallly seems more gantle and quiet.
8.0	In basically physically speaking, do not run any energy is relaxing, and doing exercise is just goes to an opposite direction.
8.0	Before you do the exercise, you have to do the warm up first.
8.0	In the exercise, you have to pay all theattention on it, and sometimes you have to show your great teamworks.
8.0	Moerover, after you finished a tiring sports, you have to take a shower.
8.0	All these things tke nearly all your left energy.
8.0	So will you call doning a physical exercise as a good way to relax again now?
4.0	Last but no the least, doing exercise maybe hurt yourself, but readinmg a book or watching a movie totally have no dangerous during the time.
9.0	You may be hurt by the heavy insturments, a fast flying ball, the deep swimming pool, or the faxst riding bike.
9.0	But the gental way never incur that.
10.0	All in all, I recomm
3.0	Nowadays, the workers are geting busy.
3.0	They have to finished a lot of work.
3.0	Some people think that having different types of tasks at work makes workers more comfortable.
12.0	But I think workers are more satisfied when they do similar tasks during the workday.
6.0	First, doing similar tasks, and the quality of the taskes the woker perform will be higher.
9.0	That is because they only have to think about how to accomplish one kind of task.
9.0	In contrast, if there are many different jobs, workers need to think about how to allocate their time or preparing extra material, even if every different task can be finished on time, there is no guarantee that the attitude of wokers towards each task is same.
7.0	For exaomp
3.0	Obivously, nowadays, a increasing proportion of people have to face the job pressure and dre requires to develope their comprehensive ability,  such as learning skill, leadshio and communication skill.
3.0	Then a quesion arises, which ability is the key to success?
3.0	Some people's answers may be a excellent communication skill.
12.0	However, as for me, I propose that it is more nececcary for most of us to studying hard in shool with a good diploma.
4.0	Admittidly, it is true that a good communication skill can have a noteable effect in team projects and strongthen the bone of members.
8.0	Without an effective method of communication, a good beginning can turn into a endless trouble.
8.0	Nevertherless, when we start coming into job, most of us will be on a low stages.
8.0	So in this period, a learning skill is the most important, which needs to be trained during the school time.
4.0	On top of that, no one want to employ a shiftless man.
8.0	That's why a good diploma is so important.
8.0	A high-quality diploma means that this employer has an adequate skills to solve some problems.
8.0	Only us study harder in school can we get this diploma.
8.0	For instance, some technologic company, like the Apple, Huawei and BMI, if a leader hire someone just because the man can relate well to others.
8.0	The leader will must be regret because he will realize the man cat not bring any profile to thier company.
8.0	The ending must be that this emloyer will be fired and then start to cultivate his learning ability in the later time.
4.0	Lastly, the processe of learning in school also can cultivate the relating ability of students.
9.0	Because there are a lot of team work in the univercity, like doing a big experience by  group form.
9.0	During working together, the relating ability will increase at the same time.
2.0	To sum up, studying hard in school is the wisest choice for us and is the key for success.
3.0	With the development of the econemies and the business, the money become become a very important part in our life.
11.0	We should learn how to manage the money at a young age if they want to become responsible to the money.
12.0	Because it could teach us how to use the money and how to use them efficiently and we also could learn how to save money.
11.0	So in my opinion I think it is very important to learn manage the money at the young age.
5.0	Firstly, by this way the children will know  they should use the money buy the things that they need most and the money is limited they can not use them too quickly.
8.0	For example, when I studied in the junior school, my parents always give me the money of the week that incloud a lot of factors of my daily cost.
8.0	One day I was on the way go back to the home.
8.0	Suddenly, I saw a very beautiful store that sale some cool transferants.
8.0	They appealed me deeply and I found that I can not move again.
8.0	So I go in to the store and the salesman also ask me to buy this.
8.0	In the end I bought this transferants which cost me almost one week money.
8.0	Next day I found that I did not have money to have meal and thanks to my classmates rented some money to me.
8.0	In the future, whenever I want use my money, I will think for twice because I notice the money was limited and I just could buy the things necessary.
5.0	Secondly, if childern wants to buy the things that they want and they have limited money, they will think of how to save the money.
8.0	This is a very good habits.
8.0	Just like me, I just have limited money but I want buy some fashion clothes and shose.
8.0	So I will find way to save money.
7.0	Every time when I have si
3.0	When taking about whether it is better that workers get different job every day, it is alwats exhibit an air of uncertainty.
11.0	Some of them suggest that people who get variaty of pracice is happier, but others advocates that.
12.0	In my oppnion, I suppors that workers are more satisfied when they have different types of jobs.
12.0	My reasons and examples are listed below.
5.0	Firstly, it is obvious that most of working requires more than one tasks to do during a day.
8.0	To be specific, people spend whole day to do only one thing is dramadically decreasing.
8.0	For example, as a teacher, your job is not only teaching students classes, but also checking their assignment or reporting students behavior to their parents, even leading them playing basketball or other sports in order to stengthen their body.
8.0	And as a teacher, you will feel satisfied because you bounded a very close relationship with your student.
8.0	They can tell you their own scerect because of trust.
8.0	Imagine that you only teach in the class then back to home after calss, you won't gain thier respective or trust.
5.0	Secondly, doing similar tasks all day long is just like robot.
8.0	People did't allowed to enjoy different achievenment, they repet the same thing over and over.
8.0	It is boring, and you can learn nothing from repeting.
8.0	It's no challenging and a kind of waisting your human's talent--creating.
8.0	That's why much of labor repalced by robots.
2.0	I think that workers are more satisfied when they have different types of tasks because of these two reasons.
12.0	I do not think parents offering their school aged children money for their success in school is a  good idea.
4.0	I disagree it in many ways.
8.0	Above all, students should not be encouraged to study by being given money.
8.0	This is the worst choice of giving any rewards!
8.0	This will give the students who are going to attend futher education a false signal : I do all this for money.
8.0	This is not good for both the society nor for themselves!
4.0	For the society, this way of thinking means a part of the new generation working for not their dreams or the good for their country, but for money.
9.0	This may lead to many problems: difficult[no matter physical or mental] jobs will lack the people that are interested in it, so many subjects like microbiology and manufactering will be abandoned for no one will study or work on it.
9.0	This will lead to the decreace of the develop of the human technology, which is not a good thing.
4.0	As for person, it will make people lose heart.
9.0	They will find themselves lost because they do not know why they are here or what they should do, they only care about money after all , so they will easily find themselves inside a mist.
9.0	As we all can see, using money to encourage childrren is useles , and will only lead to more problems.
4.0	Reasearch shows that money encourgement does no good.
8.0	There was a research that gives us samples of using money to encourage people and the using  true hearts to encourage them instead: A large number of people is divided into 3 groups, each will sacrifice one week of their vacation to make more money for the company and for themselves.
8.0	Group one gets 20% increace on their sallery;group two gets an extra pizza every meal with a bottle of cola; and group three gets the boss‘s praise.
8.0	In the first 2 days , all of them reacted the same, all fully motivaded.
8.0	But by day 3,group one lost interest and became the worst behaving group.
8.0	Group 2 lost heart and went on vacation 2 days later.
8.0	Only group 3 got it till day 7.
0.0	From all above, we can see that money can do nothing but decrease peoples interest.
0.0	Money is indeed useful, but it can not do everything.
0.0	When it comes to encouragement, stick to praises for the deep of your heart.
0.0	Giving money will only give you the opposite.
3.0	Nowadays, people often live in a tedious world.
3.0	All of us have lots of works to do and suffer in a hard time.
11.0	Thus ,it's important for us to find a way to relax ourselves.
12.0	Though, many of us might choose to doing sports, I suggest that watching movies or reading books is much more relaxing.
4.0	When we give the stress a well definition， most of stresses are derive from our body's pain.
8.0	The pain and the sour which deep inside our muscles grown out of our skin due to the physical exercise.
8.0	As an example, it is ususally to seen in the gym that sporters relaxed by stating quietly instead of doing active aports.
8.0	This evidence supports the saying that quiet things work better than do energetic sports.
8.0	Watching movies and reading books often take place in a quite quiet palce and do not need too much of body energy.
8.0	Thus, these kind of things can excape as from stress and give us lots of relax.
4.0	To get relaxing, for me, I certain doubt to define the word of relax mainly from the side of body confort.
8.0	The relax should be a self sprite whch come from inside and outside of the world.
8.0	Nevertheless, just by doing physical exercise, one can grown a strong body, but can never get a freedom of the sprite and soul.
8.0	On the contrast, movies and books are porducts of the most intelligence works.
8.0	Brilliant football player Messi alwaya reading books after he do loy of active sports.
8.0	For him, reading time is not just a respite, but a source for himself to take a deep break.
8.0	The peaceful and relaxing from the books and other intelligence things can never replace by the physical exercise.
4.0	Physical exercise is surly an important part in human's life.
8.0	The active and energy that physicial exercise brought can build uo a strong and brave person.
8.0	Nevertheless, it lack the important part compare to the movies and books.
8.0	Physical exercise cannot bocome a religion.
8.0	Even a shortest book can earn it's famous by proving it's meaningful suggestions to readers and relax them.
8.0	However, sports seems to be gone with the wind.
8.0	It cannot proved a prolong influence to people as long as books and movies.
8.0	We often heard about a book or movie change one's mind and turn him or her into a relaxing person.
8.0	However, physical exercise just filled in pain and harmful that cannot make one's mind peaceful.
1.0	All in all, I absolutly confirm that it's movies and books that do better to relax one's heart than physical exercise.
1.0	Not just because the quiety surrounding that relax a person, but the insde of intelligence and peaceful that contribute to the relax heart.
11.0	Some people believe that parents should not let children make mistake and let them lean from their own mistakes.
12.0	However, i have different idea.
11.0	When it comes to the statement that parents should let children make mistake and let them lean from their own mistakes, i strongly agree.
11.0	There are some reasons why i feel this way: the children need to remember the pulishment and they have some experience of make mistake .
12.0	Admittedly, compared with not leting the children make the mistake and letting them learn from their own mistakes, leting they make mistake is still have some benefits.
8.0	For instance, if the young children make some horroble mistakes that may hurt their lifes of hurt other people's life, that counld not give them a chance to learn something.
8.0	Becuase this mistake cause a bad result.
8.0	So these kind of mistakes is that parents should not let them make.
8.0	However there are some other aspects more important then this.
5.0	First, the children need some pulishment to grow up.
8.0	Some children always curious a lot of interest thing, but some interesting thing may hurt themselves, but if they do not try it , they cannot forget this thing.
8.0	Some the parents should let the children try, but the parents is at present.
8.0	If this thing hurt them, they would realize that it is dangerous.
8.0	So they won't try it again.
8.0	So they won't hurt themselves in the parents do not at present.
5.0	In addition, they can have some experience from making mistakes.
8.0	Because some interesting thing is dangerous for children, but it is not dangerous for adoults.
8.0	The children need to know how to have fun safety.
8.0	If parents do not let the children make mistake, the children may do not know how to use it to have fun.
8.0	This kind of experience may useful to the other aspects, and help them solves some problems in their future, because the t main reason of the thing is the same.
1.0	In the summary, i agree with the statement that parents should let children make mistake and let them lean from their own mistakes.
1.0	For these reasons, they can remember some pulishment and learn some important experience.
11.0	I agree with that parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistake.
11.0	in my opinion, If people learning from the mistakes which are made by theirselves, they would be independent faster.
4.0	Nowadays, parents always give many limits to their children.
8.0	They don't let them do these and don't let them do that.
8.0	Parents hope their chirldren can always be safe and have no terribles.
8.0	However, their children will grow up one day.
8.0	Their could not stay with them forever.
4.0	If parents can let their children make mistakes and learn from it, those children can gain more experence.
8.0	Gain more experece could make others things easy for them.
8.0	And those experences are unforgettable.
8.0	The lessons which are learned from the mistakes can help them in future life.
8.0	If they will leave their one day, they would not afraid.
8.0	because they make some mistake and learn from those would never com out again.
4.0	Let children learn from their own mistake would help them get independent easily.
10.0	If people can learn from themselves, they do not need other people remind them.
2.0	To let their children always be safty and never make mistakes is wrong.
3.0	Educating children is always a difficult task for every parents.
3.0	For example  to push their children to study and get a good mark.
11.0	For most of parents, they want their children to be distinguished people.
11.0	Some parents believe that to offer money for each high grade their children made in school is a good way which I have same opinion on it.
5.0	First of all, it is a good subsititude way to give porket money to their children.
8.0	Nowadays, children are spoiled is a common phenomenon.
8.0	They are able buy whatever they want no matter how expensive the stuff is.
8.0	Just ask money for parents.
8.0	This is harmful for children's growth.
8.0	However, if parents give money based on their exam, children will become more aware of the difficulity of earning the money.
8.0	No pain no gains.
8.0	Every dollar need  penty of works to earn.
8.0	As a concequence, they will form a good habit to earn and save money.
8.0	For parents, they can give money to children more reasonable.
5.0	Secondly, it is a good way to encourage children to study.
8.0	If they get a poor mark in the exam, they will get little money from it.
8.0	and they can not buy some stuffs they want such as beautiful shoes, clothes and etc.
8.0	So they will become more willing to get a high mark in order to buy somethings they want.
8.0	Once their get a good mark, they can earn a large sum of money, and thus forming a good cycle.
8.0	The more grade they get, the more money they earn.
8.0	At last both children and parents are beneficial.
8.0	Children get money and have oppotunity to go to better school, parents become less stress by their children.
7.0	To sum up, to give money base on exam is good way for
3.0	Under the heavy pressure,many people need something to relax themselves.
11.0	When it comes to this statement that it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise,I can't agree it.
11.0	In some ways ,they are both helpful for us.
6.0	It's obvious that both methods can free us,and the main difference between them is one of them is mental while the other is physical.
8.0	In my opinion,we need both them to help us diminish our worrisome.
8.0	First of all,We are face to mental and physical trouble from the society,which I can't emphasize too much.
8.0	Secondly,everyone is individual.
8.0	Nobody is brave to bet that anybody likes watching a movie or reading a book.
8.0	Different people need different ways to relax them,we can't  define which one is better.
8.0	The more suitable and efficient for you, the better way you use.
8.0	Lastly,in mordern society,most people have to sit in chairs for a long time,not only for students,but also for office man.
8.0	Therefore,we'd better do physical exercise to relax our muscle while relax our soul.
8.0	On the other hand,as computers developing fast,people need some excuses to reflee themselves from electrical world.
8.0	For this point of view,reading a book to relax is a wonderful choice.
0.0	In our daily life,relaxing activities is necessary which help us work and study more effectively.
0.0	Whatever we do,mentally or physically,only if we get the best effect,we find the best way.
0.0	But,don't lost any oppotunity to have a rich and fulfilling life,watching a movie, reading a book or just doing some simple physical exercise are good for your health and your soul.
12.0	From my personal perspective, I prefer that nowadays more and more people only care about themselves and spend less and less time or money helping the struggling strangers.
11.0	The reasons why I disagree the statement are listed as follows.
5.0	First and foremost, although most people are ready to help the struggling strangers, no one can deny the fact that a great deal of people use others' s kindness wrongly and cheat them.
8.0	As a reasult, the individual do not like to help others.
8.0	There is a bad phenomenon which occurs everday in the big cities.
8.0	Some senior citizens, children even the strong men beg for money rather than work or have a happy life by their hands.
8.0	They say tahy are sick or anything pathetic.
8.0	Actually, they are cheaters.
8.0	These actions make kind people feel being cheated and swear do not help the struggling strangers.
5.0	Futhermore, people are too busy to find the struggling strangers.
10.0	It takes most of us too much time to do our own jobs or write some essays or something else.
2.0	Last but not least, the family education lead to this phenomenon that people are not expected to help the struggling strangers.
10.0	From what I have mentioned above, I can safely draw the conclusion that people today are not willing to help the struggling strangers.
3.0	Nowadays peole are more likely to work and commnucate through internet because of its convenience and popularity.
3.0	We even cannot live without internet.
3.0	So some people argue that the internet provide us with a lot of valuable information while others doubt that access to so much information may create many problems.
11.0	However, I agree with the former one.
5.0	We all konw that internet has largely changed our lives in manys aspects.
8.0	for example, we get up early,open the computer and read news on the internet instead of reading newspapers as before.
8.0	because we konw that reading news online is more convenice, for the website can update the news every second.
8.0	so the readers can obtain newest informotion,especially for those businessman who have to conern their stocks every second.
8.0	what's more, reading online is more colorful, which means that the reader can experience the colorful webpage which can not be copied in the newspaper.
8.0	besides, internet provides various information than newspaper and you have more choice,so it may save our precious time.
8.0	threefore, i'd rather choose reading online
5.0	Some people worry that access to so much information may create problems, I konw they may be worried that children, especially teenagers may access to violent news or pictures thus they may make violent behaviors in real lives.
8.0	or they may be addicted to games and chating.
8.0	however, i think their parents should educate and lead them to use the internet properly, rather than prohibit them to use internet.
8.0	so these problems can be solved
2.0	I admit that the internet is a double-edged sword in our lives, but it really create much value and its advantages outwehigh its dis advantages.
7.0	and we have to acknowledge that internet do push the development of hunman beings, so we will continue to use it and develop it in order to
3.0	Schools, nowadays, prefer to shape students into well-rounded people, so they implement lots of plans to force students take specific courses.
11.0	There is a common conception that it is beneficial for students to take various kinds of courses like history, no matter what subjects they major in.
12.0	However, the opponents hold a belief that it is useless to fulfill the compulsory courses which are irrevalent to them.
11.0	From my perspective, the latter idea is more reasonable.
5.0	Primarily, it is a waste of time for students to attend the classes that will never be utilized in the future.
8.0	Since the courses students take in the university are more likely to help the students seek for employment and retain more predominances than people who do not own the professional knowledge.
8.0	For example, as a student who wants to become a computer engineer, he has to attend classes about science and engineering, not the arts or history.
8.0	If he spends part of the time on the history, it means that he will have less time to master in the knowledge he really needs to use as a computer engineer.
8.0	Instead, he will have to memorize the name of historical heros or the dates of historical events, which are totally boring.
8.0	Also, since he may be not familiar with such subjects, he will fail these classes and has to regain the credits, which is time-consuming and a waste of money as well.
8.0	Thus, it is meaningless for a student to attend the classes which are not their fields of study and acquire the knowledge of them.
5.0	Furthermore, forcing students to take courses they are not interested in may lead to students rebel psychology.
8.0	If the policy that all the students have to take the history courses is carried out, it means that students who do not like history or even dislike to study history are compeled to take it.
8.0	That is really a foolish decision to coerce students to do the things they do not like, leading to a negative result.
8.0	For example, some students will be weary of studying, since the history is just like a book without words for them, and more severely, they will lose the good status of studying and fail all his courses, resulting in the order to quit school, which ruins a student.
8.0	Thus, it is unworthwhile to implement such plan,
2.0	To sum up, not only does the policy to require all student to take history courses will be a waste of time for student who have to spend more time on the work of their majors and future careers, but also will lead to a bad effects that few students are pleased to study.
3.0	We are live in this kind of Internet age, the computre is undoubted a part of our life.
3.0	Some people thinks that children shou not palying the computer in afer class.
3.0	However I assert that playing computer game can relieve their pressure and make new firends in the network.
11.0	And in the following paragraph I will give some reason to support my idea.
6.0	First of all, children can use computer games to relax themselves and relieve their stress at ordinary times.
8.0	In our life people should assume a lot of pressure from different aspect.
8.0	For eample, my brother is a students of primary school.
8.0	And he is prepareing his course of final exam.
8.0	He feel so nervour.
8.0	As a result, he can not review carefully and lake of sleep.
8.0	At this time, he choose to playing computer game for fifteen minut.
8.0	Then he can serously and calmly start to review.
8.0	Thus he got a good acdemic performence in this final exam.
8.0	So children spent little of time on playing computer can relieve pressure and enhance their efficiency.
1.0	Moreover, children can make more new firends when they payling computer.
1.0	Children's firends can give them a lot idea of their live or study.
8.0	Foe instance, my sister is am accounting major students.
8.0	Because she like playing computer game, she can met her intimate friend.
8.0	They are often went out to relax and discuss some question of  their major to solve the porject.
8.0	So paying computer can make clousr firend.
12.0	I hold the idea that awarding school-age children money for getting high grade in school is a good idea.
11.0	However, parents still need to tell their children the correct way to respond to this.
11.0	Because money is a double-edge sword,children should be taught to deal with it.
6.0	For instance, when I was a sixteen-year-old student in high school, I got 145 points in the math mid-term examination.
8.0	And my parents were so proud of this that they gave me two thousand yuan on hearing the news.
8.0	After getting the money,I suddenly had lots of thoughts of purchasing the things I love online.
8.0	But it was then that my parents told me something that formed my view of money and I would never forget.
8.0	'Money should be not used to satisfy your desire at present, because you do not know what you really want and what counts at this age.'
8.0	My mother said.
8.0	I did not understand the real meaning of the setence at that time.
8.0	But I still kept the until I was 19 years old when I came to realize the fact that knowledge comes the first in my life ,which made me buy plenty of books I would love to read.
8.0	Now I am twenty.
8.0	Aftering reading all the books I bought that day online, I really appreciated my mother's words when she offered money when I was still a high school student.
8.0	If there was no those words, I would have bought my own PSP and probably be addicted to games already.
1.0	From my own experience, it is not the amount of money parents award school-age children for high grade but what they tell and how they teach their children to cope with money that counts.
1.0	If parents provide their children with a correct way to look at money, it will be a perfect idea to offer the children money for high mark to encourage them.
3.0	Today, due to the fierce social competition, it becomes increasingly tough for students to aquire success in their future career.
3.0	Different people have devided opinions about the key of success.
3.0	Some people may support that relating well to people is the most crutial ability, while others claim that studying hard in school is more important.
12.0	As far as I am concerned, the latter point is prior to the former one.
5.0	First and foremost, being studious in school enables us to master knowledge and skills learned from classes much more better, which is rather helpful in our future job.
8.0	That is because due to the rapid development of sociey and techlonogy, only the people who possess excellent academic background can adjust to lots of promising and challenging jobs.
8.0	Thus, it is not strange for us to work hard in school to strethen our academic abilities.
8.0	I have a salient example to illustrate my point.
8.0	I am a student who major in biology, and last semmer vacation, I worded as an intern in a biology company.
8.0	In my work, I needed to analyse data, which could only be completed by some professional software.
8.0	Luckily, I listened carefully in my bioinformation course and learned how to use them.
8.0	You can imagine without my effort in class and the mastery of this skill, it would be difficult for me to accomplish my task.
5.0	Moreover, learning hard in school is able to furnish better job oppurtunities for us.
10.0	That is because nowadays, those big corporations tend to recruit new employees in famous universities.
7.0	Additionally, the only way to enter those colleges is to
3.0	Nowaday, it is bwcoming increasingly common that parents are inclined to pay school-age children money for they get a hing score in exam or to use money to encourage their children to perform better in school, which has aroused deep social concern.
3.0	People have divergent views towards whether parents should do this or not.
11.0	However, from my perspective, I disagree with this behavior.
5.0	In the first place, children ought to be educated that the harder they today, the brighter future rather then the money from parents they will have.
8.0	It must be noted that high mark of diligent students has nothing to do with money.
8.0	They do that just for their dreams instead of money.
8.0	When people are young, their parents may give them money as a reward for attaining high grade.
8.0	However, wth the increasing of adolescent' grade, parents possibly would br required to pay more money and otherwise students may end up scoring high grade.
8.0	Decades after, older as people grow, the unfavorable belief that money equals to high mark or hard work is not extinct.
8.0	In order to make their staff work in extraordinary quality, leaders have to pay heavy price with the time goes on.
8.0	What is worse one day if leaders cannot afford to satisfy the requirement of their employees, these people who are used to be paid high to work hard will have no job as well as future.
8.0	Therefore, it isessential for parents to direct the young to drow a clear line between high grade and money.
5.0	Plus, as unpleasant as another convincing point is that children may cheat their parents and school if they can get amount of money out of it.
8.0	When the money is been as a goal, the children might do anything they can get it even lie to their parents or cheat in an examination rather than get high score by efforts.
8.0	After all, cheat is an efficiently method for many kids.
8.0	Predictably, the reward will disastrous consequence to children, school and parents.
1.0	From what has been discussed above, for a bright future of next generation and regular teaching environment, people.
1.0	including teachers and educational experts, are supposed not to give school-age children money as a reward for getting a high score in school.
3.0	Nowadays,  the public concentrate more on the child education.
3.0	Some parents give their children more time to do whatever they want, while other parents make their children to spend more time on doing homework or participating in organized activities related to school or sports.
3.0	From my perspective, making the children to spend more time on doing homework or participating in organized activities can benefit children more.
11.0	Because children can learn what they should learn without doing whatever they want.
4.0	First, children have no idea what they should do as students.
8.0	When they are infants, they can do everything freely, and from playing instinctly, they know what the world looks like.
8.0	But when they grow up and become to the teenager, playing freely cannot teach them anything, but the children don't know that.
8.0	Spending time on doing homework or participating in the activities means that the students spend time on what teachers and parents think that they should learn, for which the students can learn what they have to know exactly.
8.0	"Take me for instance, when I was about ten years old, I was interested in computer, so I really like to play the computer games and thought that this is what we called "" learning computer""."
8.0	But my parents stopped me playing it.
8.0	They bought me some books about programming, and pushed me to finish the mission that my computer teacher provided to me.
8.0	I didn't want to do this at the begining because it was really boring.
8.0	But when I have grown up, now I have to say that at that time, what I should learn was the programming, not the games.
4.0	Second, although children cannot have much time to do what they want, they still can choose what they want to do.
8.0	In fact, children can tell the parents what they like and how they feel when learn some lessons.
8.0	Then the parents have the ability to help them learn what the like or what they are talented in.
8.0	And children will also enjoy what they are doing now and work harder.
8.0	For example, my parents asked me to participate in a computer lesson because I had tould them that I was really interested in the computer and I wanted to learn how to creat a game.
8.0	So I could still do what I want to learn and study really hard.
4.0	It is true that the students cannot be really motivate if they cannot do what they want, but they can do what they like if they talk to their parents about their interest, and they will also be happy.
2.0	So in my opinion, spending more time on doing what the parents and teachers tell them to do can benefit the children more.
3.0	As an old saying goes, All hands make light works.
3.0	Cooperation always shows remarkable improvements in most fields in people's daily work and study.
3.0	As a result, working-together assignment always help students to learn in high efficiency compared with those who study isolatedly.
11.0	Reasons are as follows.
6.0	First of all, you can gain different knowledges in the process of discussion while working together.
8.0	Students have a variety of backgrounds and major in differnt subjects, therfore their exprience and knowledge differs.
8.0	And you can hear them as a suppliment.
8.0	Take myself as an example.
8.0	I majors in mecanical engineering.
8.0	When I was in a project to make a robot which can draw maps simulatously based on their sight and deliver something to a specific place, I can help them with their trouble in mecheinal design.
8.0	But when it comes to embadded systems, I always reaide my questions to students major in electronic enginering or computer science.
8.0	In this way, we help with each other and managed to make it in a shorter time than expected if we made them seperately.
10.0	On top of that, a brainstorm in a work-together project will help us come uo with more creative ideas in shorter time.
0.0	To conclude, it is the team that let us learn faster and think wiser.
0.0	Admittedly,some people may prefer to learn alone because they want to be focused while reading and thinking.
0.0	However, without the help of the team,  we may be trapped in problems when we cannot solve them, and get no help when we need someone for a instruction.
0.0	But when we are in a team, we can reach further.
7.0	With the h
3.0	With the rapid development of technology, our common people have more access to the celebrities, so they have larger impact on our views.
3.0	As for the problem whether the opinions of celebrities are more important to adolescents than they are to older people, some peope contends that older people are more tended to be beneficial from the famous people.
11.0	However, as far as I'm concerned, the opinions of famous peole are more essential for young people.
5.0	To begin with, it's more crucial for young people to  learn skills and accumulate experience from other people, especially the famous people who have already acquire achievement.
8.0	This is because the young people are in the most essential step of their life and meet various difficulties that have gone far beyond their own ability to deal with.
8.0	So it's just the time that they need to listen more experience and opinions from the successful people, which can get rid themselves of going astray on the way to dream.
8.0	Compared with young people, older people are people who have already gone through the up an down of life, they are less likely need to accept guidance from other people.
5.0	Morever, it's more convient for young people to get information and ideas from the famous people so that they are more likely to find the importance of the opinions of the celebrities.
10.0	As a group of people who  use the Internet earlyer than older people, they can make full of various electronic eqiupments and resources to study thorougly of the celcbrities's experience at any time or at anywhere.
7.0	Let me to use an example from me and my parents to further illustrate this point, when we look for an important speech from an outstanding athlete at the same time, I instantly take up the Ipad near my hand to look for this speech while my parents planned to take bus to the urban library to find related inf
3.0	As primary education becomes more and more important, parents have tried thier best to help improve their children's grades.
12.0	Someone stressed that parents shouldn't offer their children money for each high grade they get in school, as a result from that the children will study only for extra money rather than a bright craeer.
12.0	However, I disagree with it, because it not only is good way to encourage children but also can let children konw that only when they make enough efforts, can they receive abundant of gains.
5.0	First of all, giving money to children once they do a good job in examnation will irritants them to study hard, which meets parents and teachers' wish.
8.0	My cousin, Wang, a ten-year-old boy, studying in a primary school, is a qualified example.
8.0	When he was nine, he didn't want to study at all, which means that he didn't pay attention to teachers when he was in class, and he even ignored the homework  after class.
8.0	The result is he never got more than 70  grades in any coures.
8.0	His mother was so worried and one day she told him that if he could get an A in the final exam, she would give him some money to buy his favorite tools.
8.0	From then on, everything changed.
8.0	My cousin tried his best to get his favorite, so that he noted down every word teachers said in class and finished his homework in a efficient way.
8.0	Finally, he got what he wanted form his mother.
8.0	The experience of counsin suggests that children would study hard, as long as a wonderful award watis them.
5.0	Besides,  appopraite money for children also teach them more efforts, more gains.
9.0	After the children tasted the sweety of receiving money after studying hard, they would realized that they may get more if they do their best in the future.
9.0	Ano
12.0	From my perspective, I don't think it's a good idea for the parents to award their children money for high grade.
8.0	Firstly, parents have to know that studying is one of their children's own things.
8.0	No matter how much money parents wish to spend,children still need to study hard to gain more knowledge.
8.0	In other words,money can't replace the process that children spend thier efforts.
8.0	Secondly, what is the most significant ability is that children can find thier own interest in studying and obtaining knowledge and solving various problems they meet.
8.0	They have to find the beauty in discovering the beauty of science when studying rather than just reviewing textbooks to get a high score so that they can earn some money.
8.0	That's why I think parents should find ways to make their children feel more comfortable in learning and money is not a good way to impose children to studying harder.
8.0	Another reason I consider is that the effect money make can only last for a while and it's always not a proper way in children's development of view of the world.
8.0	For example,you can give your child three hundred dollars in high school after he or she does well in one exam, however, after he or she graduate, your money seems meaningless for them,at this time,you can't give them anything to make them still fond in learning things.
8.0	When it comes to the children's development of their thoughts towards the world, giving money as a reward at a young age may make them feel that money is the most important thing and ignore so many other beautiful things.
8.0	When grow up, they may only do things that can make profits instead of enriching their knowledge or broadening thier horizons.
8.0	So this is the result of just offering money in response to children's high grade.
8.0	In one word, I think there may be other better ways such as parents can show funny movies to their children rather than this one.
12.0	In my opinin i think parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from  their own mistakes, first children both are very young they can't resoultion what is right and what is wrong and parents are also can't help change childrens mind too, they just can care about childens health, thought that on the one hand, only childrens themselves to undestand.
8.0	when children make mistake they maybe konw they are wrong, so they will try them best to fix up the mistake for example: A seven years old children live in the American, she put the dog inthe garden and forget to bring it back, she very love that dog they both live together alomost fou years, so her ride a bike about the fifteen hours to find the dog, at last her find the dog in the parents company, the children parent see that are very surprise, the children tell the parents that she will never ever let the dog run away from her.
8.0	the girl become more and more have thelove to animals and sense of responsibility.
8.0	in this story children not only fixs the mistake but also learn what is love,  that is what her learn in the mistake.
8.0	second children are more clever than the parents konw their kown the mistake need themsefl to solve, sometime parents maybe wroung too they can't stay in children side to solve.
3.0	There are always many struggling people in the society no matter now or in the past.
3.0	Sure enough, they are always being concerned by all the other people.
3.0	Recently, a statement that people today are more willing to help the struggling strangers have aroused fierce discussion.
3.0	As far as I'm concerned, I strongly disagree with the staement.
12.0	Here goes my reasons and examples.
5.0	First and foremost, with the fast life tempo nowadays, everyone turn out to have less time caring about others.
8.0	In such a fast-changing society, some of the individuals hardly have time to take care of themselves,let alone caring about other strangers.
8.0	For instance, I have seen on the streets that many beggers(street performers) are exerting themselves to attract the passers-by's attention.
8.0	However, almost everyone are too busy to stop for a while to admire their fascinating skiils in some particular areas.
8.0	They are struggling for a living, but passers-by cannot see it.
5.0	Aditionally, the society in the past are pureer than it is now.
8.0	In the past, the lost money can be found and we don't even have to lock the door at night.
8.0	In such a pure and kind society, people are always willing to helpstrggling strangers and almost everyone does so.
8.0	In that kind of atmosphere, everyone is ready to help suffering people and it becomes a exceedingly good cycle.
1.0	Admittedly, with the development of technology, more access can be approached to help those struggling people.
1.0	For instance, we can assist them through media.
7.0	Once the story is reported on the ine
3.0	Nowadays, school plays a cusial role in the society and cultivates a lot of talented students.
3.0	But now wether the teacher should make ther social or political view known to students in the classroom has a hot discussion.
11.0	From my perspective, if teacher show their political view to students, it will have a negative influence on the development of students.
12.0	Next, I have some reasons to support it.
5.0	First, showing teachers' political views will make students to be frustrated to their future life or even lose passion to study.
8.0	For example, Mike, my friend, was interested in studying human administation and he thought he would many useful skills and develop a stronger pesonal relationship from this job.
8.0	However, after he listened a speech from a reputated teacher, he lost his direction.
8.0	From the teacher's view, he considered that many jobs will be replaced by the robots and because the technology was the main trend at present.
8.0	Just because this social view , more and more students like Mike had to change their mind; Just because this objective view, more and more students like Mike did not know what their future will be like and had no interested i studying.
5.0	Second, the political views from teacher are always not accurate or negative and student will understand them in a wrong way.
9.0	To illustrate, Mr.smith, a high school teacher, always said that to be a successful person, students should study without rest and never give up.
9.0	And many students from his class started studying every day and never talk with others, and never do exercise even when their tired.
7.0	They thought whatever their teacher said was right, but they did not know the tea
12.0	Nowadays, various technologies are invented and exposed to the public in order to change our life style and influence everyone.
12.0	Some educators claim that massive technologies can make children less innovative than they used to be.
12.0	Nevertheless, I do not share this view.
6.0	A convincing point is that children can use technologies to learn somrthing new, which means children can have more information to inspire their innovation.
8.0	Children can surf the internet by an ipad or a phone, and obtain knowledge.
8.0	For instance, an indian girl who is only six, had learnt programming through the internet and has made several intriguing computer games to teach children how to programme now.
8.0	She was asked to go to Google and Micfrosoft because of her high skills of programming.
8.0	In my opinion, the girl is greatly innovative, and her creation did not decrease because technologie.
8.0	In the opposite, her innovation has been hepled by technologies.
10.0	Also,
3.0	Do you feel that to obtain useful information from internet is very quickly?
3.0	DO you think that these information are very useful?
11.0	The answer must be true because these information could help students to solve some problem of study.
11.0	Moreover these valuable information can let our life become more and more convineance.
5.0	Firstly, these information from the internet can help students solve some issue which come from the study.
8.0	For instance, one day I took a chemical lesson, out teacher let us to find the component of the air but he did not tell us how to conduct this investigation.
8.0	For this situation, I open the Chrome website and input the main word ''air'' ; just several seconds later I find the information which about how to conduct the investigation about the component of the air.
8.0	And this passage gave me very detailed information such as what kind of implements will use in this investigation and the process of this subject.
8.0	It is a very valuable information because after I read this passage, I can conduct the investigation very smoothly.
8.0	In the next day, I was the most outstanding student during the chemical class and teacher also please me to do a presentation to my classmates.
8.0	So the internet can provide a lot of valuable information, which bring a lot of benefit to my academic subject.
5.0	Secondly, this information also can bring a lot of benefit to our life.
8.0	For instance, if we plan go out to have a travel, we can select the sittings that are worth to play very actually.
8.0	This is because, we can see some pictures on the screen of the computer and even know the price of the ticket; the hotal nearby the sitting.
8.0	The most important is we can see the views of other people who have been travel to these sitting.
8.0	By this way, we can know deeper and all these useful information will benefit us during the travel time.
2.0	All in all, these information from the internet not only help us do some investigation of study but also let us life become more convineance.
7.0	So I think
3.0	Today, many parents offer their children money related to children's grade they get in school.
11.0	Some people think it is a good way to encourage children to work hard, while other people may not think so.
11.0	In my opinion, I think it is not very good for children it their parents do that.
11.0	In fact, I want to tell these parents that don't take this way to encourage your children.
4.0	First, the purpose of working hard and get good grades is not to get more money.
8.0	Why do we need to study?
8.0	We need to get knowledge and develop good study ways, which can improve ourselves.
8.0	If parents give how much money depends on children's grades, children will have a not  right idea that I study because I want more money, which is harmful to children's development.
8.0	My father did that when I was young, however, if I want to buy more junk food, I will work hard for some time and when I don't have any things to buy, I didn't care about my study.
8.0	When I grown up, I realized that it is bad for my long-time study and development.
4.0	Second, it may influence children's living standards.
8.0	When they are in school, children need enough food and sleep to grow up.
8.0	If they don't get a good grade, their parents will give them less money.
8.0	In fact, children know that is punishment for their low marks and they will not ask their parents for more money.
8.0	But that will influence thier living quality and they may get sick because of that.
8.0	So this is not a good chioce for parents.
4.0	Third,parents offer more money when children get higher grades and offer less money when they get lower grades, it is not helpful for their children to have a good attitude towards spending money.
8.0	When my father gave me different number of money, I had no idea that I should spend how much each month.
8.0	It is no doubt that children need to be encouraged when they get good grades or do some other good jod, but don't take this way because it do harm to children.
8.0	It will make children  don't know how and when to spend their money.
1.0	In conlusion.
1.0	don't do that
11.0	I do not think it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.
12.0	From my perspective, physcial exercise can bring more benefits to peopel than watching a movie or reading a book.
6.0	It is clear that regular exercise will make us more healthy than those people who do not like exercise.
8.0	Countless researches show that exercise can strenghten one's immense,which can help you get away from illness.
8.0	Doing outsides activities can also increase your sense of happiness, some scientists argue that if one person insist exercising, he or she will be more happier and younger than peers.
8.0	When you running or swimming, the blood in your body will go up into your brain, which can make you more spirit and active.
8.0	From the view of health, exercise is more better than watching movies or reading books beacuse it is exercise that can give you opportunity to relax both your mind and your body.
8.0	Other than, sitting there and watching TV  or reading books can only make your mind relaxed temporarily.
8.0	So the sense of relax from exercise is more effected and last longer.
8.0	When you decide to do some exercise, you have varied choices.
8.0	For exempale, you can choose outdoors running,swimming,playing tennis or basketball,you can also do some indoors programms.
8.0	But when it comes to watching movies or reading books, you have no choise but siting there.
0.0	It is obvious that exercise is much better than the two others.
0.0	I firmly believe that when you feel tired, putting down your books and leaving your tables to do something different you can feel really relaxed.
0.0	Beacuse it is exercise that can bring you into a different situation, it must be more effective.
7.0	I think exercise i
3.0	In my mind.
12.0	I think it is a good idea if a child get a good mark then their parents would give them some money.
12.0	First,Your child is very hard-working in his school,and try his best to get a high garde,it is a diffcult thing.
12.0	If thier parents gave them some money to encourage them.
12.0	I think it is a very excited and geogerous thing!
8.0	In fact .
8.0	"When i was a kid,My mom said""If you can got the process in the final test,I would buy the toy which you want!"""
8.0	Thanks to this,I am still tried my best to learning all objectes.
8.0	Even some objets I can't get a good mark but I would write down all the answers that I know.
6.0	"Second,according to the experience,some childern will understand."""
9.0	"If you want to get it,you should paid it!"""
9.0	Nothing is easy in thier life,If you want to live better,you should go to caught it,If you don't do this by yourself ，you will get nothing,If you don't have a try,you just can't have your dream living!.
10.0	Finally,I think parents give some money if child had a good mark that could make the kid more confident,If a child get some money by learning hard,he will feel more confident and brave in his learning live in his future,He or she will be more     postive in it,and they will be more interesting in studying,because if they could do it well,they can get something they want,So they are going to focus on learning and will not give up easily.
2.0	By the all,The way of giving some money if the kid had a good mark that is a way to encourage you child,I think it is a good idea!
10.0	Thanks!
3.0	Noowadays, many people say that they are less satisfied with their life than in the past.
11.0	There are many reason why they are less happy: With the world changing and new things invented, people expect to possess more and better things.
12.0	Also, it is possible that the changing world makes them restless with anxiety, worrying that they cannot catch up with it.
11.0	However, in my opinion, people are happier than in the past.
6.0	Firstly, many social networking software invented, people easily communicate with others and share things.
8.0	The vlog and interesting news shared by friends on the internet can sweep off your bad mood and make you burst out laughing.
8.0	Also, it is inviting to discuss with others about a topic and exchange different ideas, which lead to the releasing of preasure and the distracting of your attention to more interesting things.
8.0	For instanse, my sister failed to get good grade in her final exam even if she worked hard and eagered not to study hard anymore.
8.0	I wanted to condole her, but she did not listen to me or say a word.
8.0	Therefore, I secretly asked one of her friends on the internet to share some jokes, movies and sound music on the internet and eagered to make her happier.
8.0	Knowing why my sister was disappointed, her friends condole her on the internet and uses some anecdot to make her laugh.
8.0	Finally, my sister made her mind to move on and work harder.
10.0	Furthermore, the better social welfare satisfies people.
2.0	In conclusion, people are more satisfied now than iin the past.
11.0	I do not think watching a movie or reading a book is a better way to relax than doing physical exercise.
12.0	Expecially, as a student, after all day long study and tedious class, I assumed that no student wants to read a book anymore.
11.0	At this time it better to do some exercise and let our mind and eyes take a rest.
5.0	Unlike reading and watching movies, exercise can decrease your mind extension more efficient.
9.0	Take football playing and  basketball playing as example, during the playing time, you talk, play with your teammates, beside relax yourself, you probably would get some new friends.
9.0	Friends make you relax than any other things.
5.0	Nowdays, high pressure is a common thing for the people who lives in the city, books and movies can only do a little help while excercise can truly relax mind and take people away from the busy, crowded city life.
8.0	For example, Hiking.
8.0	Hiking is a kind of physical exercise, outdoor exercise.
8.0	Beside strengthen physical health, hiking can also improve our mental health.
8.0	During the way to a beautiful mound, or along the riverside, hikers can recognize many creatures they used to ignore, compare read from books or watch from movies, it is an interesting way to feel the nature, since you can touch the trees, hear the breeze.
12.0	From my perspective,I disagree with the statement,I think doing physicqal exercise is more relaxing than watching a movie or reading a book.
12.0	First,doing physical exercise can absolutly change your nagative mood.
11.0	Because when you are doing exercise,the speed of the body metabolism would increase and some body reactions will present,such as perspiring.
11.0	From a recent study,the outcome shows that perspiring will make people feel better when we feel nervous.
8.0	Cause when we are perspiring,our body temperature is getting cooler than before.
8.0	And people who is nervous always has a high body temperature making people uncomfortable.
8.0	By the way,if you choose to read a book to relax yourself,you may feel tedious and become more exhausted than before.
8.0	Cause watching the printed materials need to use your eyes for a long time,you may feel uncomfortable and lose your interests in the book.
8.0	But doing physical exercise will never have this problem,it even could does benefits to your eyes heathy,I mean,things like speeding the process of bloods surrounding your eyes and so on.
6.0	Moreover,the place where you doing physical exercise is generally open and could bring you a refreshing feeling.
8.0	For instance,a gym,when you doing physical exericise in gym,you can feel the positive attitude from every people in there.
8.0	You even have a chance to make friends with them and talk about the training things,which could divert your focus on some unhappy things.
8.0	When compared it to watching a movie,doing exercise shows more effective.
8.0	If you choose a movie which has a tragic ending accidently,you may feel more awful and sad after watching it.
0.0	The last but not least,doing physical exersice could bring a good figure.
0.0	As we all know,everybody loves pretty and cool.
0.0	For eample,if you taking a look in the mirror or selfie with a nice figure,you mood will absolutely become better,especially females.
3.0	Since it is a colorful world where every individuals live, there are distinct views towarding satisfaction.
3.0	Diverse community counters diverse requirments and difinitions, people live in diverse community are uphold their own difinition regarding satisfaction from their work.
3.0	In comtemporary society, a large number of people are seeking for something new and special everyday.
11.0	In these people's points, different works representing different challenges and risks and these new things can lead to a more challengeble life and the following satisfactory life.
12.0	However, the others hold the opposite views that to do the same works everyday can make them more happy.
10.0	In fact, it is hard to conclude which idea is more approporiate about the issue of works' satisfaction.
5.0	Obviously, the marjority f people are unwilling to do the same work like robots while living tedious life everyday.
9.0	Different types of works can create the fresh and curious circumstance and the new tasks can add motivation to everydays' work.
9.0	With the motivation, workers will bacome ambitious to fulfill the total new challenge and satisify themselves in the process of challenging.
5.0	Meanwhile,the defects of different works are presented.
9.0	The different types of works woul cost workers more times to finish, and workers may stuck into many difficulties since the works are totally challenges to them.
9.0	In addition, works' working results need to be fit for the requirments and demands of their bosses and clients, and if the result of the challenge is not meet the satisfaction of the clients, it is also cannot meet the satisfaction of the workers themselves.
7.0	In conclusion, enery thing have two opposite edges and we cannot dr
3.0	It's universally acknowledged that food is an essential part of our daily life for that our everyday energy all derives from them.
3.0	And the types of food have been more and more various now, which leads to a hit discussion that whether people will spend less time cooking in the future.
3.0	Some claim that people spend less time cooking and preparing foods in twenty years than they do today.
11.0	As for me, I can't agree more with it.
10.0	Reasons are elaborated as follows.
5.0	First, more and more tasks make people less time to cook by themselves.
8.0	As we all know, the competition of today's society gets more and more fierce, which forces everyone to exert themselves to deal with different duties and learn new skills.
8.0	In this case, people almost have no time to enjoy a well-prepared meal, let alone cook a meal with many steps, like washing, cutting,boiling and etc.
8.0	Take my sister as an example, she is a eminent staff in Alibaba.
8.0	Everyday she spends about 15 hours on coping with her own work and trying her best to get promotion.
8.0	Hence, she never has time to cook and she just book take-out food for her meals.
5.0	Second, fast food is more and more prevalent, which causes that people just wants to eat them for saving of time.
8.0	Nowadays, fast food reaturant like KFC, Macdonald is open everywhere around us.
8.0	So it's convenient for people to go in to buy food quickly and go out with eating it in several minutes.
8.0	I really enjoy fast food not only for its good taste but also because that everyday after my maths class, I have to rush to anouther in a short time, which is a little far away, so I have no time to cook and just buy some food in the KFC next to my domitory.
2.0	To put it in a nutshell,  it's definite that people will spend less time cooking and preparing foods intwenty years than they do today due to busier work time and more fast food supply.
12.0	WHEN THE THINGS COMES TO THIS PROBIEM THAT SHOULD PARENTS LET CHILDREN make mistakes and learn to deal with it by themselves.
12.0	I HAVE TO SAY that as parents you can not let your child making mistakes and let them deal with it by themselves.
11.0	Because  in some cases children can not deal with those staff,and in the end,it turns to you become the one to solve them.
11.0	And in some cases the mistakes that your child has made can not be solved so easily.
10.0	For example when your child break a bottle that is a case that easy to solve ,but when its turns out that the bottle was an antique,how do you going to cover that.
6.0	On the other hand,commonly speaking,when a child has made a mistake,the first thing cames to him will not be if i have done something wrong,but on the contrary he would think that if someone else should be responsible for what happened.
9.0	And that leads to that he will not learn anything after he made a mistake.
9.0	So under this circumstances why will you let your child learn by himself rather then tell him what he can not do before he make any mistakes.
2.0	That is why i think we shouldnot let children make mistakes and learn to deal with it by themselves.
11.0	Nowadays, everyone wants to get a satiisfying job although it may be a little difficult for some of them.
11.0	There are some people hold the idea that if they have the chance to get a job, which is not exactly satisfying, they would like to wait until the better one apprears, while others may choose to take the job right away.
11.0	As far as I can see, the latter choice is better.
11.0	The reasons are as following.
5.0	First, the secure job could help people be more exprienced and comprehensive.
8.0	There is no doult that every job can provide opportunities for people to make progress.
8.0	They need to learn how to finish tasks on time, how to communicate with colleages and leaders and even how to deal with the assignments which they have not done at all.
8.0	It is really a good chance for them to be exprienced and skillful in work.
8.0	During my internship this summer, although the department was not so satisfying because it did not match with my major, I learned a lot.
8.0	It is a vital experinece for me because I learned the skills to deal with some unfamilar tasks, to express  myself and listen to others.
5.0	Second, getting a secure job means people can get paid right away.
8.0	If people choose to take the secure job, they could get money at the same time, which is better than staying at home and waiting to be paid.
8.0	It is the money that could help people make living and rely on themselves.
8.0	For example, my cousin took a secure job when she graduated from university, because she want to get money herself, so she would not ask money from her parents.
8.0	She told me that using the money she could live well and be really independent.
2.0	I could understand that people want to wait for the best choice and be satisfied with their own job, because the satisfyin job could make people
12.0	In my opinion, I think the projects which students must work together is more effectively than when they are asked to work alone on projects.
6.0	"There's a saying goes, ""There is strength in numbers."""
9.0	In a team, there is a teamwork, every team member can learn from each other's strenghs.
9.0	If
3.0	In modern society, people work five days and get two days rest.
3.0	Why do not people work for seven days for a long time and have a relative extensive vacation?
3.0	Obviously, some people may be fond of this life style since they can use vacation to do some time-consuming things.
3.0	When asked whether it is more comfortable to have a work where people work three days a week for long hours than to have a job there five days a week for shorter hours.
3.0	Each individuals have their own answers.
11.0	In my opinion, I disagree with this idea.
4.0	First, working for a long time in one day will diminish people's efficiency.
8.0	In other word, people will spend longer time on the task after six hours working than on the same thing after two hours working.
8.0	As a result, even though the totall number of working time are equal in these two style, we will get fewer thing done in a vocation that people work just three days.
8.0	For instance, in last summer vacation, I enjoyed the whole vacation playing and going trip.
8.0	As a result, I spent nearly fifteen hours a day in doing homework in the last few days.
8.0	By contrast, my friend Tom dedicated two hours to homework everday.
8.0	Needless to say, I was punished for the low quality of my assignment.
4.0	Second, there is every likelihood for us to forget the previous work after a long time rest.
8.0	Inevitably, after not doing one thing, we may find it different to proceed it again.
8.0	The same is to work.
8.0	If we have a long vacation, it will be hard for us to go back to work.
8.0	For example, last week my father got five days rest after just two days work and he went trip with my mother.
8.0	Nevertheless, when he came back to the office, he felt uncomfortable since he had forgotten the previous task and he even did not know how to commence his work.
4.0	Admittedly, most people enjoy long vacation and just want to work for fewer days even they need to work for a long time everyday.
9.0	Nonetheless, we cannot neglect its drawbacks, what we need to is working and studying instead of playing.
9.0	Therefore, finding a good method to promote our working efficiency and trying to enjoy our work are of paramount importance.
1.0	To sum up, having a occupation where we work five days a week for shorter hours can boost our working efficiency; in addition, we can restart our work easily.
1.0	As a result, there is every evidence to disagree that working three day a week for a long hours is not enjoyable than working five days a week for a short time.
3.0	Some poeple think that students are more influenced by their teachers than by their friends.
11.0	I tend to diagree with this statement for several reasons.
11.0	First, the things that students are deprived from teachers may just be knowledge.
11.0	Teachers are responsible for teaching us knowledge.
8.0	In that case, many teachers are just spread their knowledge to their children and they will not teach students philosophy about how to be a good person.
8.0	For example, the classes of my math teacher are full of math knowledge, however, he never talked about how we can get through the difficulties when we are studying math.
8.0	His class is tedious, and we cannnot learn anything but some fomulas in math and methods of solving math problems.
8.0	Therefore, we did not get any influence from him.
5.0	Second, students spend lots of time with their friends.
8.0	It is apparent that people will be influenced if they are with some people for a long time.
8.0	Students always play games, have meals, gossip with their friends.
8.0	Under this circumstance, the behaviors or thoughts of friends will definitely affect you.
8.0	For example, if your friend always like to wear casual clothes like jeans, sneaker, and T-shirt, you would probably change your dressing style to wear those informal clothes.
8.0	This is a natural behavior, and it cannot be preventted.
8.0	On the contrary, teachers just give you classes, and students barely spend time talking or being with their teachers after class.
8.0	In that case, it is hard for students to get more influence by their teachers.
5.0	Third, students and teachers have generation gaps, which may make students do not want to listen to their teachers.
8.0	Some students always think that what the teachers said is useless in this current society so they will not get impact by it.
8.0	For example, one of students in my class think that teachers are exaggerating the importance of getting into a colledge because he thinks that people in the past are not like today that citizens really have good skills will finally succeed even without a degree.
8.0	In that case, he will not get influenced by the teacher.
8.0	While later his friends told him that how hard it is for the brother of his friends to get a good job without a college diploma, he is convince by him.
8.0	Consequently, students are more likely to be influenced by their friends becaue there is no generation gaps between them so students are willing to liten to.
1.0	To sum up, I disagree that students are more influnced by their teachers than by their friends.
1.0	This is because some teachers only teach students knowledge, students spend lots of time with their friends, and there is no generation gap between students and their friends.
12.0	I don't agree with the opiniomn that parent s should let children mak mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.
11.0	There are several reason about it.
4.0	First,some parents are strict to the children.
8.0	They won't let the children make any mistakes.
8.0	If they make, they just give them punishment.
8.0	Although it is  bad for children and children didn't learn for the mistakes they just decide just don't do anything that make parents angry or break the rules.
8.0	being listen to the order that parents give and do it.
4.0	Second , it is bad for children to make mistakes.
8.0	Some mistake that children make have unimagineble worst consequence.
8.0	Like stealing, smuggling , robbing, drug taking and many serious of thabit that are illegal.
8.0	Some parebnts are not resposible.
8.0	They just iugnore whaat children did.
8.0	Until one day, this ifluence the whole family .
8.0	They regret it but no use.
4.0	Third , it is rediculous for children to make mistake .
8.0	Some children are so stupid,people just call them jerk.
8.0	Some children are very lazy.
8.0	They just don't want to study.
8.0	Only want to play.
8.0	Some children watn to go to some social activity like comic party.
8.0	but parents doen't let them go and make some excust on study aspects, Just about time is important, study is important.
8.0	This make children bad mood and start keepingmake some mistake to resist parents to split their feelings.
8.0	Some children's bad mood even led to their suicide on bad mood especialy on sadness.
8.0	Parents destroyed their beloved dream.
8.0	Children lose the chance to do their favourate things.
8.0	After that it remains a scar in the children's heart and mind.
8.0	They just feel sad but no parents care about what actually children think about.
8.0	This increase the bad mood of children so that make mistake.
2.0	So, I said i the end, don't make any mistakes, theres no value learn from mistake.
3.0	Education always provoked attention from many, especially parents and teachers.
3.0	Nowaday, a issue that whether parents today are more involved in their children's education than werr parents in the past is highly debated.
11.0	From my perspective, I strongly believe that parents are more careful of their children's education than before.
11.0	And i will give my reasons below.
4.0	First of all, parents pay more attention to their children's academic performance.
8.0	Nowadays, the world become more and more competitve.
8.0	You need to compete a job or a offer of master program.
8.0	To win from others, it is inevitable to become a competitve person.
8.0	And How to achieve?
8.0	A excellent academic performance is a basic.
8.0	In this way, parents take much care about their childrens' study, including study atmosphere, learning resources and most important their grades.
8.0	Take my self as an example, when I was in elementary school, my mother check my homework every day.
8.0	And she usually asked me what did you in school or how was your exams.
8.0	She even took me extra class in the weekends.
8.0	In contrast, my grandmother did not do these work, and my mother still growed up.
4.0	Secondly,  parents have enough educational backgrounds to attention their children's education.
8.0	In the past, when my mother is a child, she went school on foot, and it usually costed two hours to arrive school.
8.0	And to survive theirselves, my grandparents need to work whole as farmers.
8.0	Thus they did not have enough time and knowledge to care my mother's study.
8.0	However, now my mother work as a teacher, she can understand what I learn and check what I study, and she can even teach me some advanced knowlegde.
4.0	Admittedly,  parents nowdays are busier than before.
8.0	For instance, some business man cannot stay at home and accompany with their children a whole day.
8.0	They need to go to a far place and work there.
8.0	Nevertheless, they also hire someone to check their children's study.
10.0	To conclude, it is more time parents
3.0	Are you addicted to using techinology at present?
3.0	Compared with the past, which kind of life do you like?
3.0	From my perpective, techonology, including smart phone, computer, kindle and so on, really stifles children's creativity by occupying all their time and no spare time for them to enjoy the natural environment, which is the best place to create some new ideas.
6.0	Before the advent of techonological era, children are more likely to play on the grass and some other outside places, which make them more curious about the world and think deeply about what they see.
8.0	Newton is the best example to illustrate this statement.
8.0	As a little boy, he liked to play under the tree andpiant lonely.
8.0	Once fortunately, an apple dropped down just on his head, which made him think about why an apple will suddenly fall without some power and how to explain this phenomenon.
8.0	Hence, the theory of Earth gravitation had been brought out by Newton, which cause immensely influence on the area of physics until  today.
8.0	If Newton is present is today's society, he may stay at home to explore his technology products rather than play outside, the theory will not be found in such early time.
8.0	Thus, technology will make children become preoccupied with the games, simple and do not need to think in their mind, in the smartphones.
8.0	More seriously, more technology even make children more dependent on the advanced function but never try to create by themselves.
0.0	In nowadays, children are creative really, but they are less creative than the children in the past.
0.0	To take myself, a little gril, as an example.
0.0	All of my time is filled with video games, tv show and opera programma, which is funny and I always think to make some new games in the future so that I can play my own game all day lone and do not need to pay some money.
0.0	I indeed want to create some games, but my purpose is just to let myself play games cheaper and easily, which will not contribute to our society's development.
10.0	Thus, the creative minds in nowadays are more complex and benifit-oriented, but in the past is opposite.
3.0	The tourists choose their destinations base on several aspects.
3.0	Some people summarize that the most important two aspects are tourists' safety and whether the appearance of the city is good enough or not, and in order to attract more vistors, the local government needs to hire more police and reconstract the old bulidings and streets to meet vistors' need.
11.0	I agree with the statement, and my point can be elaborated as below.
5.0	To begin with, the saftey always comes first when people are away from home, and we need more police to make sure our safety.
8.0	Not every area has good security for the tourists, especially the area that is relatively poor.
8.0	If we can have more polices and cover all the area with police's protection, the tourist will not need to worry anout their safety and be willing to visit the area.
8.0	However, if the area's flacutrates a lot, many people may hesitate to visit there.
8.0	A good example is Africa.
8.0	Most of the countries on that continent still suffer from starvation and wars, and they are never a good destination for ordinary vistors.
5.0	Moreover, the appearance of bulidings and streets determine vistors' first impression on the city, and can largely effect vistors' comment on the city.
8.0	No matter where the tourist attraction is, the vistors will first encounter with the buliding and street of the city.
8.0	If the city seems to be old and decline, we will also worry about the environment of my accomodation, even effect my fisrt impression on the scenic.
8.0	However, if the government make the bulidings and streets more attractive, we will not have such worry.
8.0	For example, when my friend come to visit my city several years ago, Wuhan was still in the process of construction in most of the area, and everyplace seemed to be dusty.
8.0	My friend said that he had never imaged Wuhan is such a bad plcae.
8.0	But this summer, he came Wuhan again, and most of the constructions had finsished, new shopping halls and so on,  and he give me a totally different comment.
8.0	He loved the apperance of Wuhan so much.
10.0	To sum up,  w
3.0	I dont agree about the statement.
3.0	because i think watch a movie or reading a book in home is not a goodlife style.
11.0	we should do some physical exercise after the work.
12.0	It can really relax ourself.
11.0	The sports can also help us keep in good shape or live in a healthy lifestyle.
5.0	The benifit of watching movie and reading book at home is:we can just stay in home and relax we needt to get outside.
8.0	But in this kind of life.
8.0	we cant get back to work very easily.
8.0	we will think about the book and the movie when we are at work.
8.0	That will effect our study and work.
8.0	so i think watching a movie or reading a book at home for relax is not a good idea.
5.0	If we doing physical exercise for relaxing.
8.0	it has lots of benifits.
8.0	First we can always be healthy.
8.0	doing exercise can lead us to the healthy lifestyle.
8.0	Second we can make more friends when we are doing exercise at gym or somewhere else.
8.0	And   doing exercise is good for sleeping.
8.0	if we had a good sleep,we will be more energetic for the work.
8.0	But doing exercise is also have some bad things.
8.0	we might be hurt in the exercise.
8.0	so if we want to doing some physical exercise for relax.
8.0	We should pay more attention on our safty.
0.0	There are many kinds of way for us to relax we should chose the greatest one which is godd for our life and good for our work.
0.0	But the most important is we should chose the way we like most.
0.0	even doing exercise or readinga book or watching a movie.
0.0	we should follow ourself.
0.0	everybody has thrie own way to relax .
10.0	so we shoud find our own way too.
7.0	That is the true way for us to relax XD
3.0	For now this days , we are live in the big city every things we use are speed money , for students like us .
3.0	Our parents will suppport us to get good eudcation and for our daily live we need speed money on food or any other stuff , think about our parents  there some plans for limits the money that they support on they childrens.
4.0	frist of all , chrilden in different age they wants different things ,for example the child in kindgraden they many be just want some toy , a toy in walmart maybe it just cost 10 dollar , and the student in primary school they maybe want interesting books it will speed like 20 dollar when students go in to junioer high or high school that it cross a lot of many there maybe want vedio game , smaller phone , hang out for movies but also they can get parttime job (in America).
10.0	for parent you have you own plan for give money to the children.
4.0	secondly ,you can also make rule for making money for helping for some house work such us wash the dishes, sweep the floor ,cut the grass to make money and also parents need teach your children how to speed money.
4.0	finally ,parents can give your children some money and rule them how to speed it ,for different ages ,different preson ,live in the different place they speed money are different ,so parents need to depend for own family what things your child want to buy or wants to do .
1.0	for this passage they do not really good way fit all the parents but the main idea is to teach them limit to speed money ,so everyone need to think about your own way to speed money to your cheldren .
1.0	And when you children grow up he will thanksful  and teach them how many money they give to them child.
8.0	I think it's a good idea to offer school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.
8.0	Here are some reasons  to explain the advantages of this way.
8.0	Firstly,parents can encourage their children to study hard by giving money.
8.0	It's important to get a good grade and parents pay more and more attention to sduty.
8.0	However,children always can't focus on study because they think sdudy will make them lose many time playing.
8.0	So if parents can provide a new method to let their children spend more time on studying,children will get better grades.
6.0	Secondly,some people may worry that children will believe studying harder is only in order to get money.
9.0	But I think children will know study is also a way to gain money,not the only way to get money.
9.0	If they can study happy through getting money according to their grades,they will learn the advantages of study instead of looking it as a boring job.
12.0	The significance of tasks can never be overemphasized, because it is closely related by their methods of life.
12.0	When it comes to the issue whether workers are more satisfied when they have different types of tasks to do during the workday than when they do similar tasks all day long, some people disagree with this statement.
12.0	In my opinion, i agree with that workers are more satisfied when they have many different types of works to do during the working days than they do similar works all day long.
12.0	I am going to elaborate my point in the following paragraphs.
6.0	Firstly, more money can make people more motivated to work.
8.0	Money can cover the expenses of the family, and the extra money can satisfy people's own needs.
8.0	Money can buy expensive cars, houses, travel around the world, and true love.
8.0	However,if people do not have money, they cannot afford what they have now.
8.0	My sister likes to do volunteer work during the summer vacation.
8.0	She went to help the kindergarten teacher tutor to teach students, brought warmth to the elderly in nursing homes, bought books for the children, and so on.
8.0	Not only did she get the salary, but she also got many knowlege.
8.0	All in all, i would have to say many different types of works can let you get many extra money to satisfied you.
0.0	Secondly, people can obtained more experiences for work's troubles.
0.0	When people met problems, we will find a kind of ways to solve it.
0.0	We can summasized the experience to prevent the possibility of a second occurrence.
7.0	However, if we donot experience
11.0	Yes,l do think this is addod idea.
11.0	Actually,a lot of children do not want to study in thier hearts.
11.0	But in this way,we can encourage children to study,which can do a lot of help.
11.0	it can push the children's insprition out and make them study harder.
5.0	And just as we all know,this year ,the older daughter of Obama's two daughter has received the offer of Hawford University,and accroding to what l know,when their daughters were small they will give their daughter one dollar for thier good grades in school and home.
8.0	So,in the last,even the Obama couple did not give them moneny,the daughters will also finish the tasks that their parents and school give them.
8.0	This is just an exmple of the thousands of examples,but from this example,we can know that this educational way is actually effective.
8.0	And we can use this means to inspire children to study,just as Ombama couplesd did.
5.0	On the other hand,just in the society we work,praise and award is so normal that we can see it wherever we go.
10.0	So givng children praise and award in this way can help them know this world earlier,and let them know how the world and the society run.l do argue this is an effective and simple way to make us achieve this.
2.0	And my opinion is above,and l'm sure we can make our children more better.l can't agree this more.
3.0	From my perspective,I tend to side with the statement for the energy of one single person is limited.
5.0	First of all,a person's sight is limited,which means that working alone may lead to a lack of consideration about various possible problems and solutions.
8.0	So for one person,a project could have a poor outcome.
8.0	For example,if a person is assigned to discuss the possibility of building a bridge,then he or she has to consider a variety of things--budget,influence,people's opinion and the construction time and place and so on.
8.0	This is especially difficult for just one person to include these all in his or her project,for there are too many aspects and these need the brainstorm in a group.
8.0	And it is from the brainstorm that a person learns to make his or her mind fully open ,and thus has a profround opinion about many complex issues.
5.0	Secondly,a project may need a lot of investigation and tons of calculation,which may just be meaningless practice over and over again.
9.0	And as we all know,we need time and energy to learn new things.
9.0	Therefore,we may need a group to share the massive but dull tasks to relief us.
10.0	So
3.0	How to make the work perfect done is always common topic among people.
12.0	As far as I am concerned, working solwly and ensuring the corrction of every piece of work is the most productive way since it not only give less pressure to the staff, but   companies also have more time to make the products more appealing.
12.0	Besides, the detail determains the sucess, so working slowly is better.
4.0	First, the detail determaines the sucess of the products.
8.0	The mobile phone produced by Huawei is just a case in point.
8.0	Three years ago, the Huawei company increase the speed they produce their mobile phone in order to make more profits.
8.0	But after the consumers have used their mobile phone for several months, they found some commonplace problems in the mobile phone, such as it always connected to the WiFi and showed the dim image.
8.0	By investgating, the compnay discovered that it was because they  neglected the quantity of the products.
8.0	So they altered the strategy and produce in a slower speed to satisfy the needs of the consumers.
8.0	Such kind of problems would happen just because Huawei was not aware of the quantity and just wanted to achieve the purpose profit.
8.0	Details is something that we cannot ingore whatever we do, but it can only achieve by working slowly and make every piece of work run correctly.
4.0	Second, the working slowly can pose less pressure on staff, which can help to boost the efficency.
8.0	Take my uncle for an instance.
8.0	The company he work is very urgent of staff's working speed no matter the mistakes they make.
8.0	As a result, the staff always exhausted and are not able to focus on their work so it is obvious they cannot work with their enthusiasm so the company cannot make task perfectly done.
8.0	After knowing the workers' complainment, they changed the schedule for staff and found they could work better because they finally knew that the workers also need time to refreash themselves, they could not jsut urge to catch up with the process regardless of their working condition during the work because the great work depends on the working condition.
8.0	So working slowly can promote the efficiency of the workers.
4.0	Last, working slowly enable company to have more time to make the products perfect.
7.0	For instance, Apple used to show their products aunally since they can have sufficient time to make the design and the material used to generate products better and then they can sell the products to the consumers better because they are more appealling to the consumers
3.0	Have you hade to solve several works together in the same time?
3.0	Have you felt upset or anxious at last?
3.0	I have met this problem and was anxious at last because all things messed.
11.0	Therefore, I agree that people do very few things well, because they are busy doing many different things.
12.0	There is a couple of specific facets why I think in this way.
5.0	Initially, the physical function of humans' brain only allow people to solve one thing at one time when there are many things have to be solved.
8.0	When people are solving one thing, their brain will regard other things as distractions and will ignore them.
8.0	For example, when I am reciting essey, I cannot solve the math questions at the ame time.
8.0	When I try to focus on math work, I forget every thing about reciting.
8.0	At last, I do not solve math problem or recite the essey.
8.0	Thereby, people can just focus on one thing.
8.0	If we want to solve several things at the same time, we may get nothing back.
5.0	Moreover, the pressure of the burden of many things will make us anxious.
8.0	The anxiety will let us be unwilling to solve those problems.
8.0	For instance, when I was a child, I needed to do chores to earn money.
8.0	I had to watch outfit, sweep the floor and clearn the windows.
8.0	I wanted to finish these works as soon as posible, so I decided to do all things at the same time.
8.0	When I was sweeping the floor, I brought a bucket of water with me and tried to clean the window.
8.0	Nevertheless, I messed all things.
8.0	The water in the bucket spread out
2.0	Taking account all the factors mentioned above, we may safely arrive the conclusion that people do few things well, when they are too busy to manage many different things.
3.0	Once upon a time, I attended a lecture and listened to an expert talking about the planet.
3.0	He said there are nine planets in our solar system.
3.0	How ever, in the year 2006 Pluto was actually classified as a drwaf panet.
3.0	That time, I was anxious and had no idea about whether I should correct the mistake he made.
11.0	Now, I think correcting the mistake immediately will be a good choice.
4.0	Firstly, not correcting the mistake will lead professors or leaders to make more mistakes.
8.0	If the leader's later decision is based on his previous incorrect assertion, more false decisions would follow.
8.0	Tke my boss as an example.
8.0	In a metting, my boss proposed to invent a new product to attract people's eyes.
8.0	While he did take the cost into account, the cost is  too large to cover the profit.
8.0	So, he improve the price of new product.
8.0	Although I knew the truth, I didn't pint out in front of employees, because none of employees stood out to correct him.
8.0	When the new product came out, few people bought it because of the high price.
8.0	The company eventually went bankrupted.
8.0	So, it is obvious that it was a wrong decision to not correct the mistakes.
4.0	Secondly, correcting the mistakes untill the meeting ends will bring bad influences on listeners.
8.0	The reason is that people always are curious about things that they are unfamiliat with.
8.0	If the mistake is not corrected immediately, it would go with a person for a long time.
8.0	For instance, my maths teacher introduced a new formula which can help our students to calculate easily.
8.0	He spent so large amount of time to talk about it that I learned it by heart.
8.0	However, after the class, a student pointed out that what professor said was incorrect.
8.0	In the final exam, I could not recall the corrct formula because I could only remember the formula that I recorded on my professor's class.
4.0	Admittedly, it seems reasonable that correcting the mistakes in front of lot of people is rude and impolite to the professors or leaders.
9.0	They might be so embarrassed and awkward that don't how to go on with the topic.
9.0	Whereas, the persson who correct the mistake can use careful words and manners to gently remind the professor or leader to maximize the advantage of correcting the mistakes.
2.0	To put it in a shell, rather than waiting ubtil the class or metting is ober and talking to teacher or leader later or saying nothing, the best way is to interrupt and correct the mistake right way.
3.0	The level of virtue of the whole society has been questioned rencently,people wonder whether the citizens are willing to offer a help when they meet someone in trouble.
3.0	This topic has arouse heated discussion in some social media platform,like weibo and twitter.
3.0	Some people insist that the proportion of the kind heart is increase without any doubtness.
11.0	As for me, i prefer to believe that kind of good deed is not that much as people expect.
4.0	First of all,the pace of the society is dramasticly improving,the public is too tired to take care of them and their families,so paying more attention and energy on others ,especially the strangers,is a ideally matter.
8.0	For example,the odinary worker need to deal with the whole task assigned by the boss,maybe he still need work over time.
8.0	When he arrives home,the house chore also take him a lot of time.
8.0	Before he goes to bed ,he hardly get a break.
4.0	additionally,the false society event cause the dertrimental influence on public,they lose trust in the asking they will met.
9.0	for instance,my mother has a loving heart fulfilled kindness and can not tolerant any suffering happen to the kids,so she get uesd to donate the some organizes to help the chiren get away from the extreme environment.
9.0	but one day she saw the newspaper and find the assiassion always use the money on themselves instead of the poor kids,then she stopped to give her money away.
4.0	lastly,everyone has the moment that in need of a favor,it is the fact that one person can not help them all and this kind of matter will upset people,they may not kown who they should to pick.
10.0	so they will be stopped by this .
1.0	from all has been discussed above,we can saftly come to a conclusion that this generation offer  fewer help to the struggling people since the society surrounding and the frustrating facts.
1.0	they still be helpful but the kindness be instructed
3.0	I don't think parents' offering their school-age childen money for each high grade they get in school is a good idea.
4.0	Initially, offering their school-age children money for grade will make their children study just for pursuing the money,not for the desire for knowledge.
8.0	It's not good for the mental development of the children.
8.0	When there are no money after achieveing the good grade,children will lose the enthuisam for studying.
8.0	One of my classmates used to study so hard and achieve good grade just for the money, which to some extent encoureages him to study.
8.0	But after the parent stop the offering,he became not interested in learning and drawn himself in computer games.
8.0	He believed that studying is meaningless since good grade had brought no money.
4.0	secondly,offering school-age children money for grade will destroy the purity of achieving knowledge.
9.0	We have the desire for studying just because our curiosity to the world and our desire for exploring the secrets of our world.
9.0	offering school-age children money for grade would destroy those desire of the students.
4.0	thirdly,offering school-age children money for grade may help develop a terrible outlook of money.
8.0	Children may get their money so early in their life and they don't know how to manage the money.
8.0	They may spend it casualy and even grow disporpriate desire for money.
8.0	They may first just use the money for some cheap toys,but gradually they focus on more expensive toys or something and they will ask for more money,which may make them hard to live on themself after stopping this offering.
4.0	Last but not least,offering school-age children money for grade will increase the burden of the family finance,and some parents may increase the money each time just for keeping encouraging the children to make progress.
10.0	And this worsen the financial burden.
2.0	Based on what i discuss above,i don't think parents' offering their school-age childen money for each high grade they get in school is a good idea.
3.0	In my grandparents time, they took bicycles to move a long distance.
3.0	Sometimes they may just walk to their aim, and it wiould spend their more time.
3.0	They also wanted to move fast, but there are few cars.
3.0	At that time cars can just be afforded by wealth people.
3.0	That makes me think there are fewer cars in the past twenty years.
11.0	Moreover, there are two factors why I think in this way.
5.0	Initially, in the past twenty years we had few industrial factories without the tecnology .
8.0	Many cars had been transported from abroad.
8.0	And the transportation were also limited.
8.0	My grandparents said there were few industrial factories and most of these factories cannot make cars.
8.0	They just made tools for agriculture.
8.0	Even though we have the factories, we cannot make cars without tecnology.
8.0	There were fewer school that can cultivate people than now.
5.0	Moreover, we did not have spare time to work for making cars in the past twenty years.
8.0	This is because we need to struggle for food.
8.0	At that time, we did not have tecniques to make more rice than now.
8.0	The seed of rice were still rare and hard to grow.
8.0	My grandparents said they needed to spent  a whole year to grow rice without doing other things.
8.0	Thereby they wanted to feed the
1.0	Accounting to all the factors mentioned above, we can safely arrive the conclusion that there are fewer cars in use than there are today.
1.0	This is because people in the past twenty years were not educated and cannot servive.
11.0	It's clear that teacher plays an significant role in society since this job has great influences on every peoson.
11.0	Therefore, views differ when it comes to the problem whether the teacher is appreciated and valuable by society in the past than today.
12.0	In my eyes, I agree with this proposal that ancient people valuate teachers more.
5.0	The first resaon is that the teachers are rare in the past.
8.0	"There's a saying""A thing is valued if it is rare."""
8.0	Considering the past, only few people can be educated because of the hierarchy and the fund.
8.0	Teacher is a job that required deep knowlegde acquisition, so it's hard to become a teacher in the past.
8.0	It's the poor-educated situation in the ancient time that led to the appreciation to the teachers by society.
8.0	Contrary to the past, every person has the chance to go to school in the modern society, which means the amount of teachers increased.
8.0	Teachers and educational equipments become virious, so people no longer consider teachers as an unreachable position.
8.0	As a result, they doesn't respect teachers as they did in the past.
5.0	In addition, the modern society overly emphasis the quality and the independence in the class.
8.0	This educational idea causes the phenomenon that people pay less attention to the respect to teachers.
8.0	In the past, teachers such as Confusis in China, Socrates in Ancient Grace, they are respected teachers because people in the past have a strong grade consciousness, they wouldn't offend teachers easily and they considered teachers as the central leader of the class.
8.0	However, the present students tend to study on their own, which reduce the importance of the teachers.
8.0	"Imagine that students all study without the guidiance of teachers, they are their own teachers, so they won't appreciate ""the real knowledge-initiator"" any more."
2.0	To briefly sum up, the ancient society is more respectful to teachers that today because not only the number of teachers but also the educational notion in the class impact people's respect awareness to teachers.
3.0	It is debated as a common question in today's society that whether parents should let their children to make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.
11.0	As far as i concerned, parents shouldn't try to avoid their childen from mistakes which is not unusual for children's growth.
6.0	To begin with, the certificate for children's growing from kids to a mature adults is more about their mentally mature than age.
8.0	Being mature mentally relies on the power that comes from experences in life.
8.0	The more they experience, the larger percentege of mistakes they can make.
8.0	They need to confront their own mistakes and analyze the reason behind.
8.0	The process of thinking and the conclusion they made for themselves are the most essential things for growing, those would be the guaidence in their entire life.
7.0	Secondly, the mistakes that children face can also help to build and harden their soul
11.0	Undoubtedly, young people still cannot make their own decisions to make the life better.
11.0	I am sure you have seen the parents are nervous about which major their children shold choose in university.
12.0	And many parents just are worried abour their children make the wrong choice so they will still help the children.
12.0	Besides, the childrena re facing many things in their life,such as educations, entertainment at forth.
11.0	They cannot handle all of this so they need to depend on their parents.
5.0	First, we still depend on our parents because we have been constomed to this.
8.0	I am sure many children in China have this experience, you and your parents are worried about the major in university and you worked until night.
8.0	I had thath too.
8.0	I still remember when I found an university or a major thar suites me at some degree.
8.0	The first thing that I would do is to ask my parents whether this subject truly was my best choice.
8.0	It was very probable that their answers effected my answer.
8.0	Because I was just not comfortable without their suggestions.
8.0	I caould not make my own decision.
5.0	Secondly, the parents of these young people are still worried about whether their children can make the right decisions.
8.0	For example, when you decide to buy an apartmetn in a city.
8.0	Your parents could not just watch you.
8.0	They will call you to make sure that you are not taking the wrong step.
8.0	And they may obrserve around the apartment in your city and give you the better decision.
8.0	This is so common in China, because the parents in China think buying an apartment is even the most important thing in your life so they cannot just let you make the decision.
8.0	In this condition, how can young people decide their own life in the future if they meet some other significant things?
8.0	So they just are not having the chance to make own choice.
0.0	Lastly, the society nowadays is much more complicated than that in the past.
0.0	And this is why we face so many problems than before.
0.0	We must consider many factors to make a right decision.
0.0	For instance, when we go out to tour, we have a lot to ask our parents, such as which way can help us to save time most ans where is the best place to visit and how should we manage the tour time.
0.0	That is all we should think of.
0.0	And our parents are surely more experiend than us, and they can provide us with something valuable by using all the information to slove that many problems.
0.0	So that can be used to prove that young  people can still not make their own choice.
3.0	About the job choice, it has always been a heated debate whether the children should choose the same career their patents have or a totally different one.
3.0	My view is clear on the discussion that children should definitely choose the same jobs like their parents.
12.0	There are two main points that I want to explain on this.
4.0	Job or career education palys the most crucial part in one's life and development, which enable people to have a career backgroud before they have a real one, especially for children.
8.0	In a family, parents talk and do their jobs almost every day in front of their children.
8.0	It's hard for the kids not to listen.
8.0	Not to mention if the kid is really fund of his parents' jobs, they have a lot of experience the kid can learn and they know better teachers in the field for the kid's further study.
8.0	For example, a lawyer's boy may know plenty about court even he didn't take any lessons about it, which would also be more likely to make him a good lawyer as his parents.
4.0	Social relation is undoubtedly another necessity of one's career development.
8.0	In fact, it's possiblly impossible for a person to be successful without other's help or cooperation.
8.0	Just like what has been mentioned, for children who choose their parents' jobs, they do have this kind of advantage over others.
8.0	The same case, the lawyer's boy may have his parents' friends or schoolmates as colleagues or even boss, shows us the strength of relation, which means that his progress will be magnified and faults hidden or even ereased to some extent.
8.0	In other words, they have more chance to get promotion and achievement in the same field as their parents.
4.0	Apart from the edution and relation their parents can provide above.
10.0	Some instant advice and support from parents can really help the children to find the right way and grow fater in their career.
2.0	To have a summary, it's absolutely a better chioce for children to choose the same jobs as their parents for the great career education and help of social relation, along with the istant advice and support from their parents.
3.0	It is no exaggeration to say that each one has their favorate books and movies.
3.0	Here comes the question that whether we can judge a person through the books and movies they like.
3.0	Some insist that an individual's personality and hobbies will reflect on the books and movies they like.
12.0	However, out of my own experience, I firmly maintain that we can hardly learn anything percisely about a person via analysing the books or movies.
6.0	At a first place, judging a person through the books and movies is always misleading.
8.0	Human is a complex mammal, which will take totally different reactions in different occassions.
8.0	Therefore, what somebody feel like doing during the rest, such as reading and watching movies, may hardly illustrate what they are like when they are working.
8.0	Judging them in terms of one facet is inevitably partial.
8.0	Take my brother as an example.
8.0	He is a man who like the books or movies with slow pace, so many friends of him will contend that he is a person for from ambition or aggression.
8.0	However, he is always the first one finish the work among his group.
8.0	The reason why he likes the books and flims with slow pace is that he desires to enjoy the leisure after work.
0.0	Moreover, books and movies will only be a tool for people to find the common topic with others.
0.0	As is known to all, human is gregarious, so each individual cannot live without talk with others.
0.0	However, the common topic will not appear between people.
7.0	Therefore, it is necessary for each person to meet others' interest, such as books or moives, which may n
3.0	Nowadays, an interesting discussion has arisen among the public: whether people today are more willing to help the strangers in struggled field.
12.0	Many people indicate that with the development of society people is more warmhearted and glad to assist people.
12.0	However, from my perspective, I disagree with this idea.
12.0	Here are the reasons I will explain.
4.0	Firstly, people today become more careful and self-protected, which means that it is less possible for people to help strangers.
8.0	As is known to all, there are continuous reports in our daily newspapers, complaining the thickers and cheaters who used different methods to deceive nice people and stole their money.
8.0	For example, I remember that when I was a kid walking on the street with my father, my father was deceived by a strangers, who told my father that he had not eaten for a long time.
8.0	Then my father opened his pocket and rendered five dollars for him.
8.0	However, when we returned, we met this stranger again, who still asked other walkers for money.
8.0	Since then, my father never believed the strangers many more.
8.0	So it happened on many other people.
8.0	Because of the deceiving behavior, today people are seldem willing to provide help for strangers.
4.0	Secondly, people today are under a huge pressure in working, resulting in less chance to focus on the struggling people.
8.0	It is universally acknowledged that the development of technology and economy has burdened many people to spare no effort to work for a living.
8.0	And this situation accounts for a less attention to others, like the struggling people.
8.0	It has been reported that, nowadays people have to work for at least ten hours a day, compared with eight hours a day in the pass.
8.0	So it is undeniabe that people will have time to pay attention to the strangers.
8.0	For example, in the subway, many employees will bury their heads in cellphones and laptops to read the massages from their boss.
4.0	Admittedly, people still maintain a willing for helping weakers, which might be a natural behaivor for humanbeings.
8.0	However, with the development of society, this behavior could be more justified, engaged by the government.
8.0	Many countries have rules and norms designed for assisting poor people.
8.0	So, nowadays people do not have to be worried about the struggling stranges.
1.0	Taking everything into account, I interpret that many people are not willing to help struggling people.
1.0	But it does not mean people todays are lack of mercy.
3.0	As the social competition among citizens becomes fierce, there are more and more people have to work a long time, even work a whole day.
3.0	So a hot discussion regarding whether the workers are more satisfied when they have a variaty of tasks to do or do the same tasks all day long has arouse the interests among general public.
11.0	In my opinion, i think having different types of tacks are more satisfied for workers.
11.0	There are three reasons to support my opinion.
4.0	"Firstly, different types of the work don't seems like ""one thing""."
10.0	Because always doing the same thing may make workers feel upset, even though he dose the same tasks all day and he complets it, he still feel like he just complete one thing using the whole day While if he dose three different tasks all day, even though he doesn't  complete all tasks and there are one tasks left, he will still feel he has taken two tasks done which may makes him feeling successful.
4.0	Secondly, various tasks may arise the workers more ideas.
9.0	Assume that if you can't think more attractive ideas, just do another task, maybe during the process of dealing with the task you can see something what you need or you may get some ideas from the task.
9.0	This process will make the workers feel surprise and be more willing to do the jobs.
4.0	At last, various tasks may make workers learn something new.
7.0	It is more satisfied for one person to learn something new and he can use it in his works than alway to
3.0	Nowadays, people are more caring about children's education than before.
11.0	Some parents are confused about the mistakes that kids make because they think maing mistakes is not a thing.
11.0	But I would like to argue that mistakes are the best teacher of children to some extent.
4.0	Everyone makes misktakes during his childhood and so does he when he grows up.
8.0	Mistakes teach people how to learn about the world and how to behave better next time.
8.0	When I was young, my parents always encouraged me to endeavor the different things even if problems might occur during trying to succeed.
8.0	I still remember sometime I decided to learn riding bikes and my parents bought a kid-bike for me.
8.0	At first, I could not handle the balance got hurt, then my father took me to the hospital for a medical examination.
8.0	I was so scared with the bike and I refused to ride it any more.
8.0	While he just told me that making mistakes was a routine for everyone to learn and mistakes could not only help us remember the faults but also help us to grow up.
8.0	Finally I became an execllent bicyclist and even won some competitions.
4.0	The fact that letting children make mistakes is also an important way to teach them regulation.
8.0	Sometimes children make wrong things because they do not understand the rules.
8.0	During making mistakes, children are likely to analyze why they do not operate things correctly.
8.0	As we all know, rules are a vital factor of modren society and respecting the regulation is a vitue for everyone.
8.0	Children can become more confident with the help of once making mistakes as it is possible for them to elude the same things.
4.0	Mistakes are also a part of life.
8.0	Nobody makes no mistakes in his whole life.
8.0	Everyone has to accept the truth that he could not always be the exactly right person.
8.0	When a child makes mistaks, he is probably to feel down and may be diffident to some extent with apporpriate instrution so parents are supposed to give them advice as well as help.
8.0	But I just think parents should teach them how to behave better and let them learn a leason from their own mistakes.
8.0	Children are also likely to understand we sometimes fail and they can they live a positive and optimistic life.
2.0	So far as I am concerned, makeing mistakes in children is benefical and helpf
3.0	Few school-aged children enjoy learning and having tests, and sometimes they really need a motivation to do so.
3.0	As a result, some parent offer their kids money for each high grade or mark they get in school, hopong to stimulate their passion to learn harder.
11.0	However, from my point of view, even if this way can be stimulative, I still disapprove this method for several reasons listed as follows.
4.0	First of all, we learn for broadening our horizons and improving ourselves, not just for getting money.
8.0	It might be hard for parents to make their kids fully aware of the true meaning of learning, especially when they are young and naughty.
8.0	However, if parents use money to stimulate them at the beginning, rather than gradually let them know the reason why they should learn hard for themselves, the kids might think that they learn for money and prizes.
8.0	When they grow up and find that no one will pay for their studying hard, they might stop studying, which is not a good news for their parents.
4.0	Besids, some kids might be cheating during their exams to get praised and awarded.
8.0	If this bad manner becomes a habit, it will badly influence their chracteristics and their future when they grow up.
8.0	It is OK to get a not-so-good grade as long as you try your hard to learn, but it is shameful to get a high score by cheating.
8.0	The kids' mind is pure and we should not destroy thier honesty by money.
4.0	In addition, the score does not mean everything.
8.0	Some students might have already tried their best to learn, but they still can not get a very high grade or mark.
8.0	In such occasion what the parents should do is not to scold thier kids, but to encourage them to keep going and believing themselves.
8.0	If you give them money when they get a good mark and scold them when they get a low mark, the kids might think you like thier high grade rather than themselves, which will hurt their soul and influence their minds.
1.0	All in all, I think it is inappropriate to offer the kids money when they get high scores.
1.0	Parents can offer their kids A CLEANER STUDY ENV
3.0	What would you, a graduate college student that are interested in being a soccer player in the university team when your mom recommend you to compete for a teacher to success her job?
3.0	Well many people may take it for granted that to follow your mother's opinion is better since she has spared no efforts to assist you to be an class assistant and pemit you to teach some classes to her students.
11.0	Yet as far as I'm concerned, we shall choose something different from our parents'.
6.0	First of all, selecting a new job that you are good at is the basis of being successful in the future.
8.0	Take being a soccer as an example, your mature soccer skills wil have the opportunity to attract your teammates as well as not to make your self unwilling to take the job, thus everyone may think highly of yourself and the coaches are sure to offer you vital tasks to accomplish in every matches, which will in the end promote your success.
8.0	By contrast to this, however, what your parents want isn't what you have a gift for.
8.0	Consequently, you may find more difficult to continue the assignments your parents desire you to complete.
8.0	Finally, it's likely to be impossible for you to win your value.
2.0	Next, a dissimilar job are no doubt to enlarge your skills and experiences.
8.0	What your parents can instruct you is always limited, so why not to try something new?
8.0	We all know that Jordan is an famous basketball super star, while in the beginning he just would like to be a baseball player as his father predicted.
8.0	However he choosed the career of a basketball player.
8.0	By the means of this he gained his independent strategies after so many failure in the playoffs together with more talent teammate to help him to win the games.
7.0	The experience he got in his basketball life finally suppoted him to be the winner of 6 NBA Champions and first player of baeketball as
12.0	Recently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate: whether your job has more effect on your happiness than social life does.
11.0	Opinion varies from person to another.
11.0	Some claim that you job occupies most of your daily time, so that it could have more influence on your mood than other social life.
11.0	However, contrary to their view comes my perspective that there are various social life which are atrractive and could bring about much more happiness than your job.
12.0	My points are elaborated as follow.
5.0	Firstly, traveling could make a significant contribution of the happiness.
8.0	As we all know, if a person feels tired becasue of the heavy burdon from his work and family, he usually choose to travel the beautiful scene.
8.0	Under this situation, he could pay more attention to the beautiful scene, the interesting story shared by other travelers and the delicious foods with local freature.
8.0	Therefore, it is easy for him to forget the different problems, such as the arugements with classmates, the failure in an exam or the difficult Math problem.
8.0	By contrast, if he doesn't contain this traveling, he could be upset and tired all the time, which means the social life could have a considerable effect on people's happiness.
8.0	For example, last semester, after the final exam, I chose to take a trip in national forest park in Hunan province in order to release my stress.
8.0	On the way to there, I met a humerous visiter who had the same destination with me.
8.0	I saw many beautiful scenenary, such as the clear river, the relection of the sunlight, the very tall trees, which I never saw before.
8.0	Meanwile, the humenous man explain a lot of backgroud of this park.
8.0	Under this situation, I felt refreshed and was full of energy to another turn to work.
5.0	In addtition, attending a party could also play a vital role in keeping happy.
8.0	It is an effecitve way to extend your social network.
8.0	With more friends, seeking for a help is more easier when you are face to some difficulty.
8.0	It is also necessary for you to share your stress and upseting experience to them, which makes you keeping a positive attitude easily.
8.0	By contrast, if you seldom join the party, leading to a limited number of friends, you could not find even one person to share you stress and failure, which apparently causes a negetive condition to you.
2.0	In conslusion, I must repeat that although your job could be partly associated with your happiness, social life, such as traveling and attending a party, could play a more important role in the contribution of the happiness.
3.0	From my perspective, I disagree with the statement that stusents will learn much more effective when they are work together.
4.0	First, working alone on projects means I can use my time more flexible.
10.0	If i have to work a group project, group members will have to pick up a suitable time for everyone to discuss or cooperate, but when the time just can not suitable for everyone, someone may just have to compromise like miss some important meeting or just put off some private issues.
4.0	And when i work alone, i can finsh the job whenever i want without inerfering my own schdule.
4.0	Also, as for me, I can always be more concerntrate on projects when I am working alone.
8.0	When people are gathering, there must be some free chatting which has no connection with the project.
8.0	Moreover, it may be a mystery that how these free chatting would end and everybody can focus on the task seriously.
8.0	So, i would choose to work alone without question for the concerntration.
8.0	"Since there a saying goes"" attitude determines altitude"" , i believe i can work more effectively in the atomosphere of slience and focusing."
4.0	Adimttly, there are some advantages as a working-group.
8.0	When students work together they can solve problem together, but i can also make problems solved by searching on internet or just ask someone else to help.
8.0	For example, when i am facing a math problem, i obviously can discuss with a group for help, also i can search the relevant problem online as well as enhance myself.
8.0	And through this searching experience, i will may learn this question better than just discussing with others.
2.0	Finally, i still firmly choose to work project alone.
12.0	These days,people pay more attention to a tissue,which kind of education parents should give to their children.
11.0	More specifically,should parents let childen make mistakes and learn from their own mistakes.
11.0	In my view,it is important to do so  because I think going through mistakes and fault comtributes to children' growth.
5.0	First of all,making mistakes is inevitable in lifetime,and how to tackle the mistakes shows the ability of a person.
10.0	A man should gain enough experience and methods to copy with mistakes in the future.
5.0	Second,mistakes contribute to an optimistic attitude towards life,which is the most valuable thing.
8.0	After having experienced countless mistakes during the childhood,a person can be more prepared to the future and the whole world.
8.0	Take my experiences as example,when I was young,my parents encouraged me to try new things and face the problems alone,although that result in many failure and mistakes,it also build up my optimisium and courage.
8.0	I remember some day I was a child,my father take me to play roller blade,I was so excited as well as worried,I was affraid of falling down,but my father encourage me to do it myself,I tried hard but make so many mistakes,resulting to falling down many times,but gradually,I gained some techques to keep balance and move forwards,which allowed me making progress.
10.0	In a word,it is very importand
3.0	Success comes from mistakes.
12.0	In my opinion, it is more effective and memorable for children to learn from their own mistakes rather than parents' teaching or sayings.
6.0	Human have a natural ability to improve their skills.
8.0	Once we failed in a test, we would look back and find what caused our mistakes.
8.0	It is a self-driven behavior and can be done within several hours.
8.0	For example, a parent may keep a child from stairs for falling down by telling him/her several times even days.
8.0	However, the simplest way is letting him/her
11.0	i don't think it is a option to give kids money if they get a high grade.
12.0	Because we are still students now,if grades once connect with money,grades will be a kind of tool for kids to make money and then we will lose the pure heart of the study.
12.0	By doing so, not only will give kids a wrong sense of gaining money,but it also misleads kids towalk in a more diffcult road.
12.0	As the old saying goes There money in the books,which tells us that only if we can study without bad thoughs can we get what we want and be what we want to be.
5.0	As a student today,the most important task we meet is that how to get a good grade but not  how to get more money.
8.0	So we should clear our mind that money is not the thing that we pursuit during our growth.
8.0	There many things that are more beatiful in our daily life such as friends,family,and hope.
8.0	What we should persuit now is how to growth healthier without money and other things that may make our mind seperated.
5.0	As our parents,it's dangerous to give kids a concept that money is essential in their early age.
8.0	Once they know the importance of money,they will learn more directly and boring.
8.0	Then is easy to lose the passion of learning.
8.0	Therefore,it is necessary to give kids a right and clear concept about money plays what role in our life.
8.0	And how we can get money by our own effort.
8.0	By doing so,we kids can get a right sense about what they should do in their age and what they should learn in order to get more money.
1.0	However,it's good for parents to give reward to kids to praise what they do in their study.
1.0	But there are many other ways that can get the same result,so parents should be careful in what they give to their kids in their growth.
3.0	Nowadays,there are two study ways in the school.
11.0	Some teacher think there is more effective when studentsss work togerter.
12.0	But some students prefer to study alone because it is more effective.
11.0	However,I think students should work togerther so that thay can doing better in learning.
4.0	In the first,when the students work togeter,it is more convenient to slove the problem in many ways.
8.0	For example,if you joined a study group,and your group need to complete a report this week.
8.0	It is impossible to complete it by oneself.
8.0	May there have a people who is very good at take photo and there have someone in your group is very good at searching materials.
8.0	You can cooprate with them and share you think about the report with them.
8.0	It must be more effective than do it by yourself.
4.0	Secondly, you can help each other when you are working with someone else.
9.0	It is difficult to be a profect people,sometimes,you need to ask help from someone.
9.0	We can ignored our shortcoming because the other people who working with you can help you so that you canfinished the appoint more efffective.
4.0	Finally,if you work alone on project, you may be distinct by the things such as TV shows.
7.0	However,work with other people can maks you more concentrate on project because the other people will make you back to work quickly when you are not conc
12.0	Currently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate: which one is better for people, following their dreams even if the dream are ambitious or focusing on achieving realistic goals.
12.0	Opinions vary from people to people.
12.0	Some claims that people should follow their dreams even if the dream are ambitious, since such dreams means a unprecedented success which have not been exploited and it is more likely for people to success.
11.0	However, I hold an opposite view that people should concentrate on achieving realistic goals, because it is easier for us to success and perservance.
5.0	First off, the realistic goals means there are more experience and cases we can take to ensure our success.
8.0	To illustrate, when achieving realistic, even if we confront with some thorny problems, we can ask some predecessors for help, which can help us to overcome these problem more quickly and effciently.
8.0	In this case, our ultimate success can be guaranteed.
8.0	By contrast, when people persue the ambitious dream, there are usually no predeccessors.
8.0	When they face the unsettled problems, they have to struggle with it by their own and they even don't have people who understand their depression.
8.0	For instance, My professor MS. Zhang sparses no effort on resolving the problem of the technology of restoring electricity tremendously, which is thought to be extremely hard and ambitious.
8.0	Besides, he had no coworker or students who work in the same field as him, which made him feel very lonely and isolated from the society.
5.0	Additionally, the realistic goals is easier to perservance.
8.0	To elaborate, when we chase the realistic goal, we can perview the result of each section.
8.0	After complete each part of our schedule, we can get a great sense of satisfaction.
8.0	Under this circumstance, we are encouraged to complete the whole goal.
8.0	By contrast.
8.0	the ambious dreams means that the result is uncertain and unclear.
8.0	Therefore, in the long process of pursuing their dreams, time will gradually gnaw away their ambition.
8.0	For instance.
8.0	my cousin dreaming of earning 1 million dollors when he was 30 years old.
8.0	Such abitious goal make him live a hectic life.
8.0	Since this dream is far-touching, he suffers from a lots of failture which makes him lose their confidence and  long time failure make him overwhelmed by depression, anxiety and even insomnia.
8.0	Eventually he decided to give up.
2.0	To put it in a nutshell.
7.0	It is more beneficial for people to pursue the realistic goal step by step, since relistic goal can guarantee our final success and perser
12.0	As the social developing,now more and more presents hvave the ablity and willing to give more money to their children, some of present choose to give money according to the grade their child get in school.
11.0	For myself ,i think this way might have some benefits it is still not a good way for children's education.
12.0	there are some seasons.
5.0	First the young school-age children don't have the ability to control the money and us e them wisely.
8.0	according my experisence.
8.0	most of children who get money from them parents just use the money to buy toys or games on steam.
8.0	some of toy the brought even is dangerous for children like toy guns.
8.0	some of the game they buy also have bad influence for education like violent.
8.0	I think that in this sutlition a little gift like a book or a camera is a better choise for these parents,so that they can control this kind of bad  influence.
5.0	second for some older children who can control money instead of waste them,give money acccording the mark also not a good idea.
8.0	After all,study is for these childrens future development.
8.0	lt is a kind of behavior benefit themselves.
8.0	If give money for their marks they might think study is just for earn money.
8.0	in short time they may have stronger study willing, but what wii happen if they become satisfied?
8.0	my little cousin is a tur example,last year he want to have a computer very much.
8.0	so his parent told him if he can got a mark higher than 85  they wiil give him money,so he stuided very hard,and at last he achieved the goal and his parents also brought  the computer for him.
8.0	However after he achieve his dream he no longer have the willing to study hard and this year his mark reduced.
8.0	so use money as an encourage way of study is not wise for parents.
2.0	in my view that the better way parents give money to child is to according the thing the child help parents do like housework,this way can tell them the fact that only when you do something for others you can be paid ,and also the amount of money should be control to a reasonable limit to prevent student become wasteful.
3.0	As far as I'm concerned,it's a effective method for parents to let their children learn from their own mistakes.
3.0	When we were boys and girls ,it was unavoidable to make some kinds of mistakes.
3.0	"Everyone has a peroid of ""Black Memory"" in their lives."
11.0	What matters is rather making fewer mistakes ,but how much you can learn from your own mistakes.
5.0	"There is an old saying in my hometown ""once you failed you learned more""."
8.0	When I was still a naughty funny dirty boy ,I often went to my grandma's house .
8.0	And I have many friends there,Wu,Yu,He.
8.0	We four are always together,Wu and He and me were three boys,only Yu was a little girl.
8.0	There might not be something more anxious than three naughty boys' tricks for parents.
8.0	And so were us.
5.0	February is a good date, because the biggest anniversary of Chinese --Spring Festival is in this month.
9.0	In this ancient Chinese festival ,we kids can get pocket money from our parents and grandparents.
9.0	And we can use the money to buy various kinds of firecrackers.
7.0	Firecrackers might be a good but simple things for most kids
3.0	In this highly developing new world, the finance plays a crucial role in this society.
12.0	So the money is the most usual stuff in our daily life, which means people could use money every day, including children.
12.0	And now one problem that whether young children should learn how to manage their own money comes, to answer this undoubt question, most people will absolutely say ''yes''.
6.0	Few things could be more horrible than just let children spend money freely without any control.
8.0	Imagine what will happen if our children want to buy some thing, and we just buy what they want.
8.0	This could be dangerous for our children because they will come to a kind of thinking that ''all stuff in this world could be bought and I got my parents so I can gain anything I want'' in a young age if we don't teach our children how to manage money.
8.0	They will know the value of the money but not just coins or papers, they will learn that the money is not that easy to gain as snapping a finger, they will have a mind that they must cherish the fortune they have instead of buying without thinking.
8.0	For the sake of the formation of children in the future era, parents should and have the responsbility to encourage their children to learn how to manage their own money instead of letting them dafting.
1.0	Moreover, teaching children how to manage their own money enables them to be a person with many other areas of merits.
1.0	If one child knows how to use his money properly and reasonably in a young age, he will have more development in self-control.
7.0	This is because one he buy something that he liked
7.0	but he didn't really need
7.0	but hsi parents criticized him, then he would put what he has learned in mind and he will control himself next
12.0	People are busy with their work now, so they will use many ways to relax themselves during the holiday, such as doing sports, watching movies and going shopping.
12.0	Some people choose to travel and they think it is best to have a guide to accompany them on the trip.
12.0	However, I don't think it's the best way to travel with a tour guide.
12.0	That is because,traveling with a group of people, many operations will be limited.
6.0	First of all, join the tourist group is not free,because everyone have to listen to the tour guide for all the arrangements.
7.0	Secondly, we can save a lot of time by not joining the tour group, because the people in the package group are not familiar with each other, maybe you can arrive at the gathering place on time determined by the your guide, but some people are slow
3.0	Today,many parents pay highly attention to the grade of their childrens.
3.0	To make their kids concentrate on studying,some parents offer money to them if they get high grade.
11.0	I think it have both negative and positive influnce on their studying life.
6.0	Fistly,as we can kown, many kids actully get higher grades after their parents saying pay money for their hard-working.
8.0	Money can bring motivation for them if they pay little attention to study before.
8.0	when I was in primary school, I have a friend who was careless of his grades,but then had a rapidly increasement on studying,due to his parents using this way.
8.0	Thus,money have  efforts in reality.
0.0	What's more,we should kown that studying is a process to get more knowledge and gain a better future.
0.0	However,offering money can't give a correct attitude to studying.
0.0	If kids can't study well until offering them money,it means that they are not interested in studying itself    Then,I think parents could offer money in nessary
3.0	Currently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among public: in order to attract tourists, should government strengthen the safety by hiring more police or improve the apperance by improving the old building and streets.
3.0	Opinions vary from person to person.
3.0	Some claim that government should pay attention to the importance of safety like hiring more police to attract tourists.
3.0	However, i would hold an opposite view  that it is much more beneficial for government to improve the appearance by improving the old building and streets.
12.0	My points can be elaborated as follows.
5.0	First, improving appearance by improving the old buildings and streets can make the scence more beautiful, which can make tourists enjoy the nice enviornment.
8.0	Most tourists go out of home to have a good time with their friends or their family and they want to be in a nice city so that they can relieve themselves.
8.0	In China, there is rare violent accidents and rare people who are planning to travel to a new city wiil consider the safety in a  first position.
8.0	My parents really like to go to different cities, but they never consider that it will be dangerous duing a trip.
8.0	Last weekend, my parents heard that Qingdao city improved Qiming street which is very old before, they just decided to go there.
8.0	Therefore, it is crystal clear that it is of importance to improve the appearance of old builnding and streets.
5.0	Second, it will give the native civils a good emotion to study and work which may have a active help to improve the impression by tourists.
8.0	Many tourists go to a city just for one time because they think the people there are not hosptial enough.
8.0	So when government invest on the old building and street, native people may have a more active passion to talk and introduce their city to tourists.
8.0	Last year when i went to Suzhou, there is a old man talking with me in a really happy state because the government improve the streer infront of his house, which give him a big confidence of gonvernment and his onw city.
8.0	And by his words, i think i would go to Suzhou many times in the future,
2.0	In summary, from what has been discussed above, we can sfely draw a conclusion that in order to attract tourists, it is a good idea to improve the appearance by improving the old building and streets.
12.0	In modern society , if a young man has his own work , he can earn money to support his family .
11.0	And some people think the child should choose the work which is same to their parents,but the other people believe that childer should choose the different jobs .
11.0	Personally , I agree with the point that it is better for children to choose jobs which are different from  their parents .
5.0	First of all , every child has his own idea , which means that children are likely to do something they want to do .
10.0	If they donot like the jobs their parents do , they will not have ambition to work hard.
5.0	Besides ， the world is developping , and more and more jobs can be choosen .
9.0	The younng people will have a great deal of chooses to earn money .
9.0	If their parents' work is out fo date , and  the children choose to do jobs that are similar to them , they will not have ablity to support their families .
7.0	In constract , if they chooe the up to date jobs like computers and IT , they can
3.0	Do you do a lot kind of work in a workday？
3.0	Do you think the diversity of the work is very important to your work's efficient?
3.0	I think most of the people will do several things in one day rather than do only one work for whole day.
3.0	And do many different types of tasks will improve the speed that they finish the work and bring them lot of happy.
12.0	So I think workers are more satisfied when they have many different types of tasks to do.
6.0	Firstly, To do many different types of tasks will in order the worker to feel the happiness of the work rather than finish the work.
8.0	If a work do the similar tasks all day long, they will feel very boring and lose the fresh feeling to the work.
8.0	Just like a students study English, he will feel very anxious if he remember the words for whole day.
8.0	But involve some reading or listening even more speaking and let them use the knowledge that they learn.
8.0	As a result they will feel English is very interesting.
8.0	A work do several work and different work need he thinks on different way.
8.0	So when worker finish one and one work they will feel very successful and attain a kind of satisfied.
8.0	But only do one work like only write passage or have meeting for whole day.
8.0	The brain of the work is very faint and they will boring to see the same things.
8.0	Furthermore they will not like the job and depart from the job.
0.0	Second, to do many different types of takes will borden the outlook of the worker.
0.0	We all know that nowdays sociaty need a person who has a lot of different ability.
0.0	So do a same job for whole day will have bad influent to these workers' future.
9.0	This is because, they cannot cultivate the ability to do other job and gain other social skill.
9.0	For example, a worker just write passage for whole day so he is good at writing.
7.0	But because he only do the smae
12.0	Wether parents should give their kids money each time they get a excellent score on their tests has arosen debates among people.
12.0	Some people think that it is not a good idea to give kids money too early, in contrary, others think that rewards like money is totally benefitial for children.
11.0	From my perspective, I wholeheartedly agree with the latter for the following reasons.
4.0	Rewards can help the kids to find their intrests in study.
8.0	Kids usually cannot find study interesting because the classes are relatively long and seems to be boring for them.
8.0	That cause young people cannot concentrate on the class, and they won't find study interesting if they are not even focusing on the class.
8.0	By the way, it is a common phenomenone that kids doing something else other thatn studying during the class,such as chatting, sleeping and drawing.
8.0	So a reward seems to give the children a reason to listen to the class ,and then they will find learning interesting .
4.0	Second, giving youngsters money as a reward for good mark on test is a way to make them know rules about pay and gain.
9.0	To set up an example, my uncle give my cousin gifts each time he do something good like getting a good result on a test , doing houseworks.
9.0	Meanwhile ,my cousin seems to have a sense of only if he work-hard and achieve some good things ,he will get paybacks.
4.0	Hwever some may think that money for each time kids get a good grade shall be a burden to most of the families.
10.0	Since the requirements from kids are higher and higher each time.
2.0	To sum up , I think offering money for schhool-age children is necessary because is has money good censequenses on different aspects,like finding interests in studying and get a sense of pay and gain.
3.0	In such a highly competetive society, relationship is an important role in people's daily life, becasue you can ask them for questions or experiences.
3.0	these poeple are always your teacher or your leader.
3.0	Consequently,  we have to consider everything in our daily life in order to leave good impression to them.
12.0	So, think about the situation and solutions the question gives, I agree with the second solution, and I wil present three points proving my opinion.
5.0	First, interupting others will disturbing others rhythms of taking to others.
9.0	For example, when you are in a conference hall, and you guys are listening to your boss's speaking,when your boss are prepare going into a next topic, you have some different opinion about the last topic, no matter your boss want to unswer you or not, he or she has to give you a unswer, even though you have got your unswer, you had disturb the whole rhythm of the meeting and all you people will have a worse feeling about the next topic.
9.0	Howver, if you can wait until the meeting is over, then go to your boss's own office to get your answer, you are not only can solve your perfectly, but also leaves a good  impression to your boss that you are a man like to think things deeply, and if you do that, you are not far away from your promotion.
5.0	Second, don't solve your problem in time is a bad habit.
7.0	For instance, if you have a problem during the class, you don't watn to interrupt your teacher, however, after the class has ovee
3.0	The hot topic about the influence given by celebrities has aroused public attentoin and debates for a long time.
11.0	Some people think that famous person may have an further impact on teenagers far more than on older people.
11.0	Apart from that,some people hold them opinion determinedly that there is no gap between the influence on youngsters and the older people.
11.0	To my perspective,I prefer to the former opinion.
5.0	To some aspects,the elder may spend some leisure time on TV programms,radion programms,even moving their eyes on internet for the information to satisfy their demands,but the use of new technology and device is less frequently then the young people,leading to a small-sacle rate to catch the fashion about celebrities.
9.0	At the same time,teenagers have an easy access to the information published on the smart phones or internet.
9.0	Even when the play computer games,they have the possibilities to catch a sight on the advertisements spoken by the celebrities,which has an attandance to draw their attention and stimulate their desire to purchase the products.
5.0	In addition,youngsters have a sensible smell towards trendy.
9.0	They would like to follow the action or behavior given by the cecebrities,since their mentle and physical development is under mature.
9.0	They are more likey to simulate the famous people,leading them to an unhealthy life style.
2.0	To sum up,I obviously think that the influence given by famous people have more deep impact on the young people then the older people.
3.0	In these days, the using of Internet has become more and more general and we can get so much informations by surfing on it.
3.0	Meanwhile, these phenomenon caused lots of discusion.
3.0	Some people would think access too many information will create problems.
11.0	Instead，I belives that using Internet to gain information is useful and harmless.
4.0	Firstly, searching on the Internet is one of the most convenient and fastest way to obtain  informations.
8.0	As the development of all kinds of electricity, we can use computers, smart phones, even the smart watches to get the information.
8.0	Whenever we have some questions , even the five years old kids konw to use google to know the solutions.
8.0	Just click the botton, thousonds of information will pop up in one second.
8.0	This is a really profitble thing.
4.0	Whatsmore, thanks to the social media, now we can get to konw all kinds of information comprehensively in the first time.
8.0	In the past, maybe we could know some big news by newspapers.
8.0	But now, by using facebook or instagram we can know the dymanic information of friends and familes, the foremost stars' gossip, or the political news when they first come out.
8.0	These makes our life much more convenient and works in a more effciency way.
4.0	At last, although such number of information coud produce some negative infulence to small children.
8.0	But this can be reduced by the supervision of teachers and parents.
8.0	They can avoid child come into contact with bad information by controling the use of internet and smart phones.
8.0	Moreover, we can educate the kids in a direct way to avoid them from infulenced by bad informations.
2.0	In a word, the Internet can provides people so much informations and benefits that the small problems might be cause
8.0	I agree the following statements, some poeple believe that doing alots of things can help people work more effiency, so they wil do better.
8.0	However, other hold a dissimilar viewpoint that people will focus on few thing so they can do the work better.
8.0	As for me i agree the later one.
8.0	My reason and example are listed ass follows.
6.0	One reason why i am in favor of my perspective is that the work result wll be better.
9.0	This is because when people have few thing to do they will be more focus on the work  also makes worker easrier to know what they need to do, because they have clear purpose, they just need to follw the step and focus on one thing, which making the work result better than many works.
9.0	A good example of this is my little brother mike, he was worked in  the supermarket, once of time his boss let him
11.0	Being asked where to go traveling, many people think that it is better to travel in their own country.
11.0	They say that people learn more there because they can communicate easily with each other and get more information.
11.0	However, I think people benefit more when traveling out of their own country.
5.0	First, people learn foreign language and culture from their trip.
8.0	Staying in the foreign environment, hearing everyone saying foreign language, people use this language conciously or unconciously and fluently be familiar with it.
8.0	Also, affected by foreigners, people get used to the customs there, which really broaden their horizon.
8.0	For example, my sister went to Mexico last summer.
8.0	That she happened to go there during the Day of the Dead excited her a lot.
8.0	Like the native people, she drop the petals on the ground to build a road and put some food on the table for the ancestors.
8.0	This trip taught her daily expressions of Mexico and awared her of the interest to the culture of it.
5.0	Furthermore, people feel the sense belonging and love to their own country.
10.0	Away from hometwn and with all the strangers saying the words they cannot understand around, it is easy for people to miss their own country and the silings there.
2.0	In conclusion, though traveling in own country has some advantages, it is more beneficial to travel in foreign countries.
7.0	Thus, I advise people to travel out of their own
12.0	In recent years, as more children have the right of education, it's more commen for parents to reward children who get good grades with money.
11.0	Though money seems like the thing that unsuit for young people, in my opinion, parents offering money for high grades is a good idea which I think has two main reasons.
12.0	Belows are the detail of them.
4.0	On the one hand, there aren't any diferences between money and other things if they are used as rewards,because both of them can encarage children's spirit.
8.0	Some usual rewards like toys and books may be seen to have pratical use.
8.0	But if children use money to buy things that can be used pratically, the result is the same.
8.0	So as for the useing way, money is like other rewards.
4.0	On the other hand, money can help children have the concept of saving an earing at an early age,which is benificial for their later life.
8.0	There is a commen problem that plenty of freshmen in the society aren't able to use their money properly, always wasting a lot or saving too much.
8.0	So if children begin to think how to use money early, they will have more experience when they enter the work area.
8.0	Even if they make some mistakes about the usage,the hole can be make up.
4.0	However, it must be admitted that handling with money early has an unavoidable problem, which is that children have the possibility of holding a mistake concept of the power of it.
10.0	To be detailed, if young people not use money on the right things, for example, purchasing too many luxuries or spending on computer games, they will sink in the loop of using money inappreciatly.
7.0	After all, offering money for children's good grades is a good idea, but at the same time ,parents should help children have the corect concept
12.0	With the improvement of people's quality of the life, more and more people choose to travel in other cities or counties, I think public tranportation is also an important part of a city and the good traffic can promot the developmen of this city.
12.0	So I think the goverment should improve the tramsportation rather than internet.
6.0	First, a good transportation can improve the economic development of this city.
9.0	That is because people think in this city it is easy to get to the destination, which can promote the tourism development of this city and improve the economy.
9.0	For example, when a person comes to a city for a tour, as soo as he gets off the plane, he is able to catch a taxi and arrive to the hotel on time, without waiting for long lines or searching for a place to get a taxi.
3.0	Now, many parents want to help their children get good achievement at school.
12.0	So their use a idea that if children get good achievement at school, the parents will give money for them.
11.0	I think it is a bad idea.
11.0	Because I think we should make children like to study, then they could get good achievement.
11.0	This is a good idea.
6.0	First, studying is a very important skill, so kids mustget this skill.
8.0	It can help kids overcome many barriers at future.
8.0	Because this world is growing, and they get many important informations by study.
8.0	They wil not be left behind.
8.0	This is a fact, everyone could not escape.
1.0	Second, if parents use this idea that parents offer money when the children get good achievement at school to make kids get good grade, they will lose study power.
1.0	Because if you could not give children money, they will get bad grade.
3.0	When it comes to making mistakes, many people consider it as a terrible experience in their lives.
12.0	So do numerous parents who go out of their way to prevent their children from making mistakes.
11.0	However, as far as I can gather, I firmly contend that parents should allow children to make mistakes and let them to learn lessons from their own faults.
11.0	The reasons are manifold.
5.0	First and foremost, in some degree, mistakes can be considered as precious personal treasures.
8.0	What's more, if we can learn from them, we can make use of them to the fullest.
8.0	When we make mistakes, it apparently reveals our shortcomings and our inabilities in some fields.
8.0	Therefore, not only can we have a better understanding of what we are uncapable of, but also offer a guidance of how to improve ourselves.
8.0	Parents shoulder the responsibility to bring out the best in their children, so it is of great significance that they encourage their children not to be afraid of making mistakes and tutor them to gain from their own mistakes.
8.0	For examples, when I wanted to make a birthday cake for my best friend, my mom didn't make a cake herself for fear that I might make many terrible mistakes because it was the first time I made a cake myself.
8.0	Instead, she stood right beside me and only offered help when I asked.
8.0	During the process, I indeed made a lot of mistakes, but her smile encouraged me to adjust the proportion of the ingredients and explore my own flavour of chocolate cakes.
8.0	My DIY skills improved dramatically after this incredible experience.
5.0	Secondly, allowance for mistakes during parenting can relieve the stress on children.
8.0	Mistakes are unavoidable and they are sure to occur in children's life.
8.0	However if parents keep pushing on children and forbid them to make mistakes, their mental health is at stake.
8.0	Too much strain will come out of the fear of making mistakes.
8.0	And children may end up going to extremes to avoid making mistakes or rather prevent their parents from finding out that they are making mistakes.
1.0	All in all, I'm convinced if parents let children make mistakes and teach them how to learn from them, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.
1.0	And it will guarantee a promising future.
3.0	In now days, many people doubt on should every university student take history courses.
11.0	In my opinion, all university students should take history courses, regardless their acdemic interest.
5.0	Firstly, learning history can help people understand their own culture .
8.0	Cultures and civilizations has their own feature.
8.0	The history usually contain those feature.
8.0	Only by  learning  history, people can understand their culture better.
8.0	For example, if you learn the Chinese history and the story of Quyuan, you can know why people should have dragon boat competition and eat zongzi in the dragon boots festival.
8.0	If you do not learn the history of that priod of time, you are not able to find out what meaning of this festival and get the cannotion of this festival.
8.0	You will doubt on your culture and it is harmful to inherit your culture.
5.0	Second, learning history is benefitial to people to build their independent thinking.
9.0	History always has two side, people need to compare and contrast two side, then build their own perspective to the history events.
9.0	For example, the Europeans find the America and colonize this land.
7.0	The America bring amount of wealth to the European, so the European think colonize the America is a honour and
3.0	It's better to relax by doing exercise.
11.0	Doing physical exercise is better because it can do help to build  up one's body and live a longer life which might be very admirable to many youth.
12.0	A health body call for many things such as a health diet and a suitable scheduel,but physical exercise might be the main element if someone do want to build a strong body.
11.0	When doing exercise,one can help himself to explore his  body including various  physical abilities and how to stengthen it.
5.0	Besides,peope who have the habit of regularly doing physical exercise have more posibility to make new friends and get into new groups.
8.0	It is helpful to people who initially don't have much friends with the trend to felling isolated.
8.0	For example,exercise like voleyball or basketball need to cooperation with teammates.
8.0	A person in a ball game team may have more chances to get rid of communicating，sharing or some other skills of making friends with people.
5.0	Of course watching a movie or reading a book can also do the jod of learning yourself and make new friends ,but these ways might have less effect than doing exercise.
9.0	Because exercise need enough space ,the best place for exercise is a gym which is offten with a lot of user.
9.0	At this situation, doing exercise brings people relaxation and connetion with others because you have to share the space with others even if you don't have to talk with them.
2.0	So for those who don't do exercise often relax should be something new such as going outdoors and learn new friends.
7.0	And in the ineternet-conenncted society, we may all have more ways to read or watch a movie and enjoy ourselves,but I do think physical exercise and connection with
3.0	It is been said that young people know how to make life choices wisely better than those in the past.
11.0	I agree with the statement for the following reasons.
4.0	To begin with, young people nowdays have better access to education.
8.0	The amount of people that have post-graduation degree has increased significantly.
8.0	While in the past, many young people did not have high school education.
8.0	Some even had no chance to go to school.
8.0	When people are equiped with knowledge, they tend to make decisions effectively and efficiently.
8.0	They are more clear about what they actually need in their typical stage of life.
4.0	What's more, technology has been developed dramatically over the past decades.
8.0	Young people are now living in the environment surrounded by new inventions.
8.0	Internet and electronic devices provides enormous amount of oppornuties for young people to boraden their eyes.
8.0	By looking at more, they know how to make choices for their own.
8.0	However, young people in the past posed limited resources.
8.0	Their perspectives were restricted.
8.0	In this case, they would ask other people, like their parents, for adive in their live paths.
4.0	"Lastly, as the term ""global village"" is spread out, countries become boundless."
8.0	Yound people can easily go travel around the world, and exprience all kinds of culture and religions.
8.0	With rich expriences, they see what they like and what do not like.
8.0	When they make decisions in their own lives, which direction to go becomes quite clear.
8.0	In contrast, yound people in the past could not go abroad so easily.
8.0	They did not have the chances to explore and experience.
2.0	Above all, young people today know how to make wise decisions in their own lives becasue they are better education, access to technology easily, as well as increasing travelling opportunities.
3.0	In this fast developing society, people usually won't pay much attention to what happened in the past.
11.0	And when asked about the attitude towards whether all the students in the university should be asked to take history classes without concerning what their field of study is, people always exist an air of uncertainty.
11.0	However, when the question comes to me, I wholeheartedly agree that all university students should take history classes.
4.0	First, taking history courses can give chances to university students to gain more friends.
8.0	Since university students may have a lot of pressure, they would like to have friends with who are interesting while they are also helpful.
8.0	And people who know a lot about history may be more interesting to communicate with.
8.0	Moreover, people who take history courses will know many history events, so when their friends have some trouble, they can give their friends many constructive suggestions.
8.0	In this way, students who take history classes can be helpful and interesting.
8.0	So they will have more opportunities to make friends.
4.0	Then, many history events and historical heros should be remembered.
8.0	People today have happy lives because of their ancestors who devoted themselves to their countries.
8.0	Their ancestors did a lot and even sacrificed themselves to gain happiness for their offsprings.
8.0	How can people forget about them and forget how they fight to defend their countries with gratefulness?
8.0	So, no matter what field the university students study in, they are always a member of the country.
8.0	In this way, they have the responsibilities to remember their ancestors and pass on the events that their ancestors went through to the next generation.
4.0	Last but not the least, taking history classes can make people love their country more.
8.0	In the history classes, people will get to know what was their origin, how they developed, and what their ancestors went through.
8.0	Take my own experience as an example.
8.0	When I was in junior high shool, I took a history class.
8.0	And during the class I got to know a lot of tragic events that happened in the past right on the earth where we are now.
8.0	And I know that our nation paid a lot to win the battle.
8.0	Although it was tragic, we have a happy life now.
8.0	So I thought that I should love my country just like my ancestors did, and devote myself to the country in order to make it better.
2.0	To conclude, I personally think that it is necessay for all the university students to take history courses no matter what field they are study in now.
12.0	As a rookie in teaching, i strongly believed that doing the same or similar tasks all day long would be much easier and more satisfied than having many different types of tasks.
11.0	Because you don't have to be trained with so many different complicated  tasks, especially when  you are a rookie.
12.0	However, after experiencing the same job for 3 years with the similar tasks all day long, i think totally differently from before.
12.0	I think workers are more contented when they have different kinds of tasks to do than when do the same tasks all day long.
5.0	First, doing the same tasks in a day is very tedious and quite boring.
8.0	And you can imagine that you will be pretty frastrated after you lose interest in the cliche work.
8.0	But having different tasks would be very interesting and your interest and curiosity would last for long.
8.0	For example, i was asked to the only task by washing dishes in a  restaurant.
8.0	After i finished the job, i felt bored and wanted to quit.
8.0	So i was asked to do more tasks like cleaning the teables, sweeping the floors, offering menus to customers.
8.0	Finally i persited in it and got a promotion and i was very satisfied about the job.
5.0	Second, having different types of tasks to do will increase the job effectiveness.
8.0	Your brain will be cleared when shifting from one task to another.
8.0	Moreover,  in this way, your all kinds of marketing skills are trained and improved.
8.0	Hence, you will be a well-rounded talent for the job maket.
8.0	If you do the same task, you don't have a chance to strengthen  other skills other jobs required.
8.0	For example, if your job just requries you to be an assistant in teaching, your public speech skills would not be developed as a teacher.
8.0	Your knowledge on academic aspect also can not be improved so quickly as an assistant doing the same thing.
8.0	Consequently, you would not improve yourself and get promoted so quickly that you will not so satisfied.
2.0	To sum up,  workers would be more satisfied when they have many different types of tasks to do during the workday than they do similar tasks all day long.
3.0	With the rapid development of socialty, there are more and more advanced technologies for peopel to use, and people become more and more richer than before.
11.0	Thus, I think there are a great numbers of teachers will occur, who are more talented and have more time to teach students than few decades before.
12.0	Later, I will illustrate my points in the paragraph below.
4.0	To begin with, the country is becoming more wealthy than before, so many peopel can study in other country, then backing to import the knowledge.
8.0	As we know, the teachers who can go aboard are better than the normal teachers.
8.0	For example, my biology teacher is a old man, about 67 years old, just can tell us some knowledge about the Chinese animals.
8.0	However, other class' s teacher is a young teenager, who once went to America.
8.0	He not only can import some knowledge about Chinese creature, but also some USA;s animals.
8.0	Thus, everyone loves to listento his class, and we all appreciate him.
4.0	In addition, young teachers are good at using new technologies to teach class, which is more convenient and attactive for students.
8.0	Compared to the old teachers, nowadays professors can use the PPT to import knowledge without writing by hand.
8.0	In this way it can save much time in the class and let students to focus on you.
8.0	Hence, more and more students will like the young teachers, and they will admire him in order to learn some thing new from them.
4.0	Although soem say that old teacher are more experienced than the young teachers.
9.0	Nevertheless, I assert that olders are more likely to get diseases or other things, so that they usually need to miss the class.
9.0	Therefore, these behavior will influence the student's studying, and students will not like these teachers because they always disappointed them.
2.0	All in all, Ithink that young teachers arebetter than the tehachers in the past.
11.0	I agree with the statement that the question mades is that in the past, young people depended too much on their parents to make decisions for them; but in the today's life, the young people are made the decisions by theirselves more.
4.0	First, in the past, the society is different from the today's life, because the life in the past is around the families.
8.0	But the life in today's is actually different from the past.
8.0	For example, in the past, the young people had to married with the person who is selected by the oldest person in the family, although the person who had to marry did not like the each other.
8.0	And if you want to marry with the person who you liked but the family did not agree, they will not agree that you are one member of the family.
4.0	Second, in the past, in some villiges, the parents who had two kids and one is a boy but the another one is the girl, they will let the boy to study in the school and they will let the girl to do the house works and do some farming on the farm of them.
8.0	Why the parents do this of their kids?
8.0	Because they think the boy is better for the girl.
8.0	And if there was a family wants to keep a girl and send she to the school, the people who lived in the villages will not think that family will success.
4.0	Third, in the past, the parents of the young people thinks that there was only one way to success , the way is that to go into the university.
8.0	And if you didn't go into the university, although you have a good life, they won't think you are a successful person.
8.0	But in today's life, there is more ways to reach the success, for example, goes into the school which is not a university but is a school which is good at one techology, like the engineering school, the car fixing school and so on.
8.0	Because of this, you could study in the thing which you liked.
2.0	That's why I agree with the statement the question gives.
12.0	Admittedly, workers are more satisfied when they are doing different kinds of tasks in during the workday than diong the similar tasks all day long.
5.0	Firstly, workers would finish their tasks more efficiently and effectively when they get accostomed to the pattern of multi-tasking, and this would result in the improvement of their working efficiency and acceleration of the daily schedule.
8.0	Take my work as interpreter for example, a qualified interpreter should be able to finish varied tasks and difficulties at the same time, including reading, listening, taking notes, tranlating and speaking simultaneously, it is actually more fulfilling than doing the single task one by one.
8.0	During the process of decoding and encoding, the interpreters feel satisfied when tackling these probelms simultaneously.
8.0	It is hard to say whether finishing the similar task all day would be much more fulfilled, but doing different types of tasks can definitely enhace the sense of happiness.
5.0	What' s more, getting satistied and work effeciently are not the same thing after all.
8.0	Saticfaction means the enjoyment when altering the working pattens and thinking patterns, one can get totally relaxed and relieved, this would in turn, make themselves feeling more easy, thus boosting the speed of their working and enable the employees to finish the tasks efficiently and feeling satisfied.
8.0	A worker who are diong the similar tasks all day long can certainly not feel the sense of fulfillment of taking breaks when altering different types and patterns of tasks.
8.0	In all, diong multi-tasking enable workers to enjoy themselves than doing the same kinds of task all the day.
2.0	Whether the worker would feel much more satistied when doing the same tasks or doing differnt kinds of jobs can be a controversial question, the only undeniable point is that the more efficient and perfect they finish their tasks, the more satisfied and fulfilled they would feel during the work.
8.0	Both changing different means of work and altering the thinking patterns can make the workers get relieved and relaxed down.
8.0	Though, finishing the same kind of work may seems more boring and tired, it can enhance employees' working skills and learning ability after all.
8.0	Everything is two-side sword, regardless of multi-tasking or doing the single task.
3.0	People are influenced by their families a lot.
3.0	Especially for young people, they usually make decisions depending on their parents' opinion.
11.0	Some people think that young people depend less on their parents and are better able to make their own decisions nowadays.
11.0	I agree on this idea.
4.0	First of all, parents today are more liberal and intefere less about young people's decisions.
8.0	For me and most of my friends, our parents give us much freedom deciding what we want to do.
8.0	They even ask for our opinions when they are making decisions.
8.0	We grow up in an environment leading us to make decisions by ourselves, so it gradually becomes a habit to decide independently.
4.0	Besides, the society today is changing rapidly, making parents' experience less useful.
8.0	In the past, parents can teach their kids what major they should choose when they get into a university, what job to do in the future, etc.
8.0	However, today's society changes a lot.
8.0	The
4.0	At last, young people have more resources to help them make decisions besides their parents.
8.0	Nowadays, people can communicate with others easily, leading to an expansion of their social circles.
8.0	They have more friends than before, and they can easily contact with them.
8.0	Young people today can also access to more information easily using the internet.
8.0	In this case, they have various way to get help instead of merely depend on their parents, asking what to do.
2.0	To sum up, I think young people taday are more independent when making decisions about their own life, since parents give them more freedom, parents' experience loses their value in a new society, and young people have more resources to help them make decisions.
3.0	Recently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among the public: whether the paid for the teacher should equal to the paid for doctors, lawyers or business leaders at least.
3.0	Opinion vary from person to person.
3.0	Some people claims that the paid for teachers should not be increased.
11.0	However, I would stand on their opposite side and I believe that the salary for teacher should at least as much as doctors, lawyers or business leaders.
5.0	First of all, increasing the paid for teacher is conducive to improve the quality of education.
8.0	It is primarily because the teachers will do their best to teach the students with a high salary.
8.0	If they do not make progress on education, they would feel sorry about a increased paid.
8.0	Thus they will try to improve their teaching skills and the quality of presetation for class.
8.0	The quality of education will rise.
8.0	For example, my math teacher used to teaching class only by obelity and his class is tedious.
8.0	When the government decided that the paid for teacher would be improved.
8.0	My math teacher began to teach us with more energy and the quality of class was improved.
5.0	Further, a rising salary for teacher is helpful for increasing the number of excellent teachers.
8.0	This is largely since the high paid attracts more people to become teacher.
8.0	So the competition for the occupation will grows.
8.0	And the winners who the position by defeating other rivals are more excellent.
8.0	For instance, when our city decided to increase the salary for teachers.
8.0	A lot of people from different fields tried to seize the chance becasue if they succeed they would got a profitable paid.
8.0	So some professors gave up their research and choosed to be teachers.
1.0	To put it in a nutshell, I firmly believe that the teachers should be paid at least as much as other high-paid jobs.
1.0	This is not only increasing the quality of education but also attracting more excellent people to become a teacher.
3.0	For a long time, television as a public medium for human beings, has entertained people with various programs.
3.0	Without any shadow of doubt, whether or not we accept it.
3.0	Television, specially advertising , change the principal of human kind's contemplation.
3.0	With this in mind, some believe that it stands to reason that television advertising directed toward children aged from two to five need to be banned due to its negative effect, while others hold the opposite view.
11.0	As far as i am concerned, the first attitude three of the most substantial are discussed below.
4.0	The most compelling point is that advertising companies often prosent their products in an exaggerated manner, which leads to mislead kids due to the fact that children under the age five lack the ability to inderstand what is good and what is bad.
8.0	They believe everything they see around them; hence, they think whatever they watch on television advertising is true.
8.0	For instance, i had a cousin who is four year old, one day when he watched a television advertisin in which a small child managed to fly thanks th wearing a coat.
8.0	He, immediately put on his coat and started to try that stunt on his room window.
8.0	As a result, promotions have a dirct effect on children owing to the fact that kids are not able to extract the gist of advertisements, they believe what they just believe what they say.
4.0	Another interpretation why i do not concur with the latter perspective in the introductory paragraph is that promotions may cause waste money and emotional torture for parants when they fail to fulfil their irrational demands of their children.
8.0	Regardless of what is children's true needs, commercial companies aim to only sell their products, which are mostly useless or unsuitable for children.
8.0	They use colorful and fantasy promotions so as to attract children to demand those items from their parents.
8.0	If parents consider the products and find them kind of meaningless junk, they cry and insist on purchasing that things, which can make parants crazy.
8.0	Consequently, commercial messages may not only be unsuitable for children, but also bother their parents.
4.0	Last but not least, television advertising promulgates bad habits among children.
9.0	For example.
9.0	in order to promote junk food products, advertising companies often exhibit a fat child who starts eagerly devouring unhealthy food such as burger and pizza, which inclines children to unhealthy food rather than healthy one, changing their eating pattern, thus endangering their health.
1.0	To put it in a nutshell, having considered all of the aforementioned ingredients discussed above, i do endorse my point of view that the demerits of commercial messages directed toward students are more than its merits.
1.0	Therefore, i think that there is an essential need to revolutionize the legs regarding advertising and parents sjould keep their eyes watching what their kids seeing.
11.0	As far as I am concerned,doing physical exercise is a better way to relax instead of watching movies or reading a book.
11.0	Firstly,it is cheaper and more comvenient to do physical exercise than the other two alternates.
12.0	If we study or work for along time and need to relax we can just do some simple exercise right there without paying tickets to go to the ceremony or going to a store to buy a book.
11.0	Doing several exercise can be very relax and we don't need to pay for anything or go somewhere else.
9.0	Beacuse physical exercise can be as simple as possibal.
9.0	Such as SquatFu,push-up,head-rolling,waist-rolling and so on.
6.0	Secondly,doing physics is much more healthy than watching a movie or reading a book.
8.0	As we all known,after a long-pirod study or work,our eyes are very tired and need to relax just like our mind,surely as far as our body.
8.0	While watching a movie or reading a book is undoubtly harmful to our eyes.
8.0	On the country,doing physical exercise not only can relax our eyes bu also toughen up our body and free our mind.
8.0	Can you image how it is enjoyable  to do some exercise with listening you favorite music.
8.0	While if you still ues eyes ,they will get drier and you will feel less comfortbal.
8.0	Inaddition,as the physical expert said,phycisical exercise is necessary after mental work.
8.0	Because most of our work or study need us to sit on our chairs for a long time,which dose harm to our hip and spine.
10.0	ISummary
3.0	As the development of the society, celebrities are exposed to the public more completely than ever before.
11.0	Some people thinks that those famous people have to be so because it is an essential part of their work--- they choose this path and they must sacrifice something for the wealth they get.
10.0	However, as for me, I strongly believe that famous entertainers and athletes deserve to have more privacy for following reasons:
5.0	First of all, being too exposed may make the celebrities go astray.
8.0	It is true that they can gain much money, but they cannot be content because they are always worried about being followed by others.
8.0	They need to be very suspicious and care about everything around them--Are there any reporters?
8.0	Am I Peeped?
8.0	Everyone has his or her own secrets, if they are all known, the person must be anxious, uneasy, and gradually will develop some mental illnesses.
8.0	More than everything, they may take the drug or do other illegal things to release the preesure.
8.0	For example, there was a very famous actress in China.
8.0	She was brilliant and should have won the oscar.
8.0	Unluckily, because she could not bear the little privacy she had, she drank tons of wine, took drugs and did many things that broke the law.
8.0	At last, she became a prisoner which was totally a tragedy.
8.0	If her privacy was well-protected, she would have be a winner of life.
5.0	Admittedly, their work makes them to have less privacy than common people.
8.0	However, they are also a person, they still have feelings like common people.
8.0	They also should be somewhat protected.
8.0	Only then will they devote themselves more into acting and bring more joy to the audience.
2.0	In a word, famous entertainers and athletes deserve to have more privacy than they have now considering the bad influence on their lifepath and the basic feelings they have like the common people.
3.0	Most of the parents  think it's nesscary to keep a goal for their child to reach.
11.0	Some people hold the view that money may do harm to their school-age children as they have few possessiveness,while others believe that an acceptable amount of financial support should be given to the teens .
11.0	From my perspective, it's reasonable to offer money to school-age children as a regard for each high grade they get in school.
4.0	First of all,as a courage-meaning regard, you cannot predict your children's favor very well ar once, then money will be a good choice.
9.0	You can be easily solve the regard problem without waste your time to think about how to choose a gift while no one could blame you for you didn't know his own favor.
9.0	Both kids and you will be happy and satisfied.
4.0	Second,it will be a good chance to exercise the school-age children's financial management if you give them money.
8.0	You could ask him the plan of using this money.
8.0	If the budget is quite well,then you can both know he is getting on well on both his study and money management.
8.0	That what exactly they need,plan for their futhur money and life.
4.0	Last but not the least,money is very necessary in school-age children's daily life.
7.0	They can use money as a support of their i
11.0	Many peopel will say that it's not very important to know the big events which are irrelevent to you because they don't influence your daily life.
11.0	I agree that you don't have to learn much about them and be a expert if you don't major in them.
12.0	After all, whether Trump will be the next president or not does not influence my life directly.
11.0	However, I still agree that we should art least know about it.
4.0	Primarily cause, we all live on the planet, earth.
8.0	When the Internet and technology develop more and more advanced, it's unlikely that things happening on the other side of the world don't have impact on our life.
8.0	However, the flap of a butterfly in Brasil can cause a tornado in the U.S.
8.0	Therefore, those international big events cannot totally be irrelevent to us.
8.0	For example, ISIS, the most evil organization nowadays, is a big danger for people in mideast.
8.0	It looks like whether it's been destroyed or not don't have direct link with my life in China.
8.0	But if the ISIS finally rule all of the mideast, it's obvious that the internation oil price will skyrockets.
8.0	We drive cars to work or school.
8.0	Thus, our cost on the petro will increase sigificantly.
8.0	If we learn about the international news, we can easily figure out what is happening now.
8.0	Even if the ISIS concurs the mideast region, we can prevent unnecessary cost properly.
4.0	Secondly, we all want to communicate with others.
8.0	If you care about everything and know what the big events now, you can talk happily with all kinds of people and become a magnet to all people.
8.0	For example, if you care about basketball, you will konw that the Cleveland Cavliers is the champion of this season, which was 1-3 left behind the Golden-state Warriors .
8.0	You can talk with those who love basketball, those die hard fans just lke me.
8.0	And if you care about the movies, you can talk with movies fans about the recent best sellers like the War and Warcaft and X-men.
8.0	Those materials can help you to become the shinest one in the parties.
4.0	Admittedly, there are too much information nowadays.
8.0	We can't deal with the overload information even with all of our time.
8.0	Hence, it's significant to filter the useful information for you.
8.0	You can only concentrate on a few limited fields which may be relevent to your life or increase your range of experience.
8.0	Though the news are too much and distrubing.
8.0	You will still benefit from it and spend the least time.
8.0	You have more time to deal with personal things and live a better life.
2.0	To sum up, whereas the big events happening around the world can be not relevent to your daily life, the advantages of saving unnecessary money, coupled with more material for chatting, makes a strong case that we should care about the great events happening on the other side of the world.
3.0	Currently, a conterversial topic has aroused a heated debate among students: Add more police to ensure safety and build more old buildings which one can attract tourists.
3.0	Opinions vary from person to person.
3.0	Some claim that improving the old building and streets is the perfect solution.
3.0	However, contrary to their view comes my perspective that improving the safety by hiring more police is the best solution.
11.0	My point can be elaborate as follows.
5.0	Firstly, hiring more police can stabilize people's emotions and give them a sense of security.
8.0	To be more specific, people's will choose the safety place to travel.
8.0	Because the trip is use to make people be relax and let them to see the beauty things.
8.0	On the cntrary, if government improving the old buildings and streets, it is tantamount to cheating tourists,  because these things are all fake, and the government cannot guarantee that these places are safe.
8.0	For example, when i was young, i went to Yunnan to travel, so our government hiring many police to Maintain orderand keep visitors safe, so we can safety to travel in this place, so after this trip, my family and i all feel good emotion, because we relax ourselves and have a good feeling to this place.
5.0	Secondly, hiring more police can protect scenic spots form tourists and protect tourist from accidental injury.
8.0	To be more specific, Now some tourists have poor quality and like to destroy scenic spots, such as scratches and paintings, also the building of some scenic spots will hurt the tourists because they are not strong enough for a long time.
8.0	On the contrary, if government do not hiring more police, there will be a lot of accidents.
8.0	For example, i went to a high mountain call Wudangshan, because the mountain is too high, so the road is very steep.
8.0	So our government hiring many police and volunteers to protect the tourists do not stoned or otherwise accidental, but this trip still exciting.
8.0	So after this trip i get a lot of experience.
3.0	Nowadays, more and more people prefer traveling to relax themselves.
11.0	Some people hold the view that we can benefit more from traveling in our own country than from traveling to foreign countries.
11.0	From my perspective, I agree that we can benefit more from traveling in our own country beacuse it is cheap.
11.0	On the other hand, it will be more convient since we don't have communicate in foreign lauguage.
4.0	First, we can save a lot from traveling in our own country because it cost less money.
8.0	As we all know, finance budget  should be considerated when we plan to travel to some place.
8.0	If we choose to travel in our own country, we can definitely save a lot of money.
8.0	For example, I traveled to Beijing last summer for several days and I went to many places of interests.
8.0	The most transportation I used was bus so it was really cheap.
8.0	Besides, the price of the hotel in our own country was also low.
8.0	If I travel to a foreign country, I will need to take a airport so it will be very expensive.
4.0	Second, it is very convient if we travel in our own country because there is not the barrier of lauguage.
8.0	When we travel to foreign country, we must learn the foreign lauguge to communicate with the people there.
8.0	My brother onced traveled to the United States and he told me that it confused him when he traveled since he did not speak English fluently.
8.0	He often misunderstood the travel information since his poor English.
4.0	Admittedly, if we travel to a foreign country, we can get to know their culture and custom and broaden our horizons.
9.0	However, it will cost a lot and we may meet with lauguage problems.
9.0	Therefore, we can benefit more from traveling in our own country since it saves lot of money, and it it convient for us.
2.0	For the reasons I mentioned above, I strongly think we can benifit more from travel in oure
12.0	With age advance, people be more busy and tired.
11.0	The most of people feel one thing that they need to relax.
11.0	Now a part of people think the most relax thing is doing physical exercise  .
11.0	But other people believe that watching a movie or reading a book is  the more relax thing than doing physical exercise.
11.0	I think so.
6.0	To begin with, watching a movie or reading a book will spend less vigor.
8.0	Undeniable , doing some physical exercise must take you more energy.
8.0	Because you have to thinking and trying in this process.
8.0	It will take your remian energy.
8.0	You are going to feel tired after free time.
8.0	But watching a movie or reading a book is different to doing physical.
8.0	watching a movie or reading a book don't make you think more thing.
8.0	It give you happness and relaxed.
8.0	You can take yourself.
0.0	Secongly, doing some physical exercise will effect you next thing .
0.0	No matter what you make or brake, you will thinking it in next time .
0.0	This state will be keeping a long time.
8.0	It must effect your do others thing.
8.0	In fact, in the free time, you don't relax.
8.0	Maybe you think you relax .
7.0	But you not , you breat i
3.0	Young people are always passionate and have the ability to overcome all the difficulities.
3.0	Some assert that young people nowadays start to spend more attention in improving the world with their abilities.
11.0	I agree with this idea and I think several reasons lead to this situation.
5.0	To begin with, young people have more chances to know about the outside world.
8.0	In the past, young people were confined in a small area because they didn't have the ability to travel and get informations.
8.0	However, with the development of Internet and transportation, it becmoes much easier for young people to get to know the outside world.
8.0	In the process of getting to know the outside world, it is not surprise that many young people want to step out their cramped area and make efforts to improve the whole world.
8.0	For example, my parents grew up in countryside, they didn't even know the existance of outside world until they started to work in the city.
8.0	However, I have learned a lot about the world since I was young and want to improve the world with my hand.
5.0	In addition, young people have more availiable ways to improve the world.
8.0	It was certainly impossible for young people to have chance to help the others or state their opinion in the public.
8.0	Even though young people in the past also wanted to improve the world, they didn't have the chance to use their ability.
8.0	However, young people today have many avaliable ways to improve the world, including volunteers, writing articles, and donating moneys.
8.0	For example, many college students become teachers of the students in poor area.
8.0	This is impossible in the past.
10.0	To sum up, it is much easier
3.0	In modern society, young people are playing vital roles in the social development.
3.0	Some people thinks that the young have no influence on any important decisions which will have a strong effect to the future of society, while others hold the opposing attitudes.
11.0	As for me, I disagree with that opinion, too.
11.0	In fact, young people is an essential part during the time when people make decisions.
5.0	First, when making decisions, the elder would like to listen to the young people's ideas, which are objective and beneficial.
8.0	It is the young group in the society that is really active and energetic.
8.0	There are many good ideas in their brains becausef they are exposed the the new environment and new technologies.
8.0	When government make some important ideas, they like to listen to the young people and ask for more advice.
8.0	Last summer, I attended a meeting of local government and was asked to give some advice about how to develop the sevice for the public.
8.0	I gave my opinion and realized that young people are being paid so much attention to.
5.0	Secind, young people using Internet to influence the decisions.
8.0	Nowadays, Internet is more and more important for people and the society.
8.0	When there are some serious problems, people will discuss about them and give some information and advice through  the Internet.
8.0	In this period, young people try to give their opinions and help to make some decisions, although some of them are not old enough to attend the vote or some other meetings, they would like to help and paly their parts well.
7.0	Although some people may think young people are less exprienced and not get  comprehensive development
3.0	Nowadays, more and more people pay attention to the governments' invest.
12.0	Some of them think governments need to spend more money to support the development of arts while others may think more money should be used in support of athletics such as state-sponsored Olympic teams.
12.0	As for me, I agree with the first opinion.
12.0	The reasons are as following.
10.0	First, the arts could help
11.0	Yes i agree that the young children should be make decision about their own lives.
8.0	At first i think that parents even that she or he was fully known by her child.
8.0	They also can't feeling what their child really want.
8.0	Because sometimes young children can't be understand by their parents.
8.0	Like my parents.
8.0	I like to read the history book and politics book,But my parents do not think i like it, so they buy some of the novel book to me.
8.0	In this passage we can know that our parents cant felling weel and know what we really want!
8.0	If they choice we dont want things ,it's not only make children feel bored,also it's a waste of our parents.
5.0	Secondly,your parents always help you to choose so while one day you need to choice by yourself,how could you to do?
8.0	"Call to your parents to ask them""hey mom i get a troble in the company,i didnt know what should i do!"""
8.0	So i think the children should to development their independence ability while their young.
8.0	I was reading in a newspaper story.
8.0	This story talk about that the young boy need to their mothet to help them,Buy in the university,he doesn't need what should to do because his parents is leave him very long.
8.0	He even doesn konw how to use ICcard!
8.0	So while he was using out all of the money,he stolen a women's money but was find out by the police.
8.0	This story also told us the important of the one personal independent to his whole life.
5.0	At last i want to talk something about myelf.
8.0	When i was young boy,my parent was a business,always not go home.
8.0	So w\i learnd how to cook and how to wash clothes,i feeling i like a little adults.
8.0	And i also believe while i go to the social life,i can be better than any others students,because this road is not follow for my parents,it's walk for my personal!
3.0	With the development of the society and the economy parents pay more attention on their children's eduction than before.
11.0	This is because nowadays our life become better and better so parents will have more time and ability to involved in their children's education.
11.0	Moreover, education of the children in nowdays become more important than before.
10.0	So I think nowadays parents are involved in their children's education than were parents  in the past.
5.0	Firstly, with the develpoment of the commmunity, parents have more time and vigor to involve in their children's education.
8.0	In before, for example, my grandparents did not have enought time to involve in my parents' education.
8.0	This is because, the life during this time was very hard; they should spend more time to feed this family; and provided enought school fee to their children.
8.0	But this situation was not similar to nowadays because the development of the economy and the life of us became better and better.
8.0	So my parents, for instance, always helped me to solve some academic problem and they always communicated with my teacher to know the representation of mine in the school.
8.0	Moreover, nowadays parents gained very well education so they were more capable than parents in the past.
8.0	My parents were all colleage students but by the contrary my grandparents were just gained high school education.
8.0	Clearly, my parents were more ability to provide some useful advice and involve in my study than my grandparents.
8.0	So parents today are more involved in their children's education than before.
5.0	Secondly, the education of the children become more important than before.
9.0	In the past, people in our country did not need too much level of education and if one person have very clever mind and good opportunity, he will be successful.
9.0	But nowadays people must went to a colleage only by that we could have the opportunity to find a very satisfying job and gain a very brillian future.
3.0	I disagree with the following statement.
3.0	When students work together to make a project, it might be less effectively than they work on their own.
3.0	They could spend a lot of time on chatting things that are not relative to the topic and waste their time unconsciously.
12.0	In the contrast, working alone will raise their spirit and ambition to finish their job and gives them a sense of satisfaction.
4.0	First and foremost, the conception of time will fade in team work.
8.0	The efficiency is about time-saving.
8.0	But when we are talking with our friends or teammates, we just enjoy the time we spend together and ignore its running off.
8.0	For instance, when we are discussing about where we are going to have lunch, as a team, we will have lots of fresh ideas to think about.
8.0	Then we need to conclude them into one conclusion, which will consume a lot of time and we do not seem to be aware of it.
4.0	By the way, the union of the team may be unstable.
8.0	We can not suit everyone's need and favor, so there must be some disputes and even fights.
8.0	Then we need to deal with these things and waste the time which we could have used to complete and embellish our work.
8.0	The difficulty to find everyone in our team kind and cute is too serious.
4.0	In addition, the responsibility assignment.
8.0	It is usual that you will not want to devote that as much as you do in personal work than in team work because there are someone else who will share your responsibility.
8.0	And it turns out that only a few of the partners in the team are working while others are just slipping their mind.
8.0	It is not only unfair to the burden but also to individual development.
0.0	According to what is set above, I am strongly against the statement that team work will have more efficiency.
0.0	Actually it is the sense of responsibility that matters and determines the efficiency.
0.0	Either team work or individual work, we just all need to shoulder our own responsibility.
3.0	it is difficlut for parents to sit back and allow their child to make mistakes , so there is a heated discussion about should parents let the children make mistakes and let they learn from the mistakes .
11.0	some people believes that parents should .
11.0	however , others hold a  dissimilar viewpoint that they should not as for me , i agree whith the former.
12.0	my reasons and examples are listed as follows.
5.0	most parents go out of their way to protect their cildren from everythigs from bumps and bruises to emotional hurts.
8.0	iy is reasonable for parents to do that because their are definitely love their own child and they do not want to see their child be hurted by their stupied mistake , while some mistake can be extremly dangerous.
8.0	however , no matter how much they wants to help their child , children need to have the freedom to make mistakes and learn from  them one reason why i am in favor of my perspective is that errors and mistakes can be the  greatest lessons for the cildren.
8.0	this is because children can experience what  it feels like to do the silly things so they learn that making poor decisions  leads to things that are not going to have positive influence to them and these mistakes can leave a lasting impression on children , so they will never make that mistake again . a good example odf this is when i was studiying  in the middle school  i always forgot to bring the key of  my home , but my mom was always staying at home so i never worried about it .
8.0	but one day when i came back home , found tha t nobody is there and i did not brought my key either.
8.0	so i waited nearly 3 hours in the cold wind until my mom came back .
8.0	since that i learn a lesson that always remember to bring your key with you.
5.0	in adiition the mistake can be the best way to free the creativity of the child .
8.0	anyone who ahs never made a mistake has never tried to make anything new .
8.0	albert einstein said so.
8.0	indeed the mistakes offer us the opportunity to explore the new stuffs , they will introduce the chance to our life .
2.0	to sum up , if we wnt children to develop a sense odf resonsibility , make good choice and become more daring , we have to let them go and make mistakes.
3.0	Perhaps nothing in this world is as important to our life as the environment.
3.0	Some people aclaim that one of the main issues for the government is to protect wild animals and the wilderness areas for our offsprings.
3.0	However, I disagree with them.
3.0	I advovate we needn't pay too much time and resources on the protection of the wild animals' habitat and the wilderness areas.
4.0	Firstly I want to say that the protection of the wilderness areas are really a heavy cost for the governments in the world.
8.0	Most of the wilderness areas are covered by the asian, african and latin american countries.
8.0	And we all know that there are hardly any deproved countires in those areas.
8.0	So the people in those poor countries really need to use those resources,.
8.0	Controversely, the protection of those areas are conflicted to the use of them.
8.0	So, it's a hard choice for those governments choose not to use or sell those resources.
8.0	Use them can get those governments much money, but the protection needs them to cost money.
8.0	For example, an latin american country have a tropic rainforest.
8.0	The government couldn't afford enough food for their people incase it cust the wood and uses the area for agriculture, but if the government choose to protect the rainforest, that means it not only can't get a coin form the resources, but they need to pay a lot to employ forest keepers.
8.0	I believe that none of the governments would make such decision when their people are  hungry.
4.0	Secondly I don't think we need to keep such large area for our off springs.
8.0	The mainly reason fo the endanger animals' protection is they are endangered.
8.0	But every wild animals can be feed at the zoo.
8.0	So we needn't to leave huge such habitats for them at all.
8.0	We only need to catch them and keep them artificialy.
4.0	Some people may argue that our offsprings may complain about us when they could only appreciate those glorious and mysterious scene by videos and photos.
9.0	However, I advocate that the human's life is more important than the enjoyment.
9.0	I can't accceptounterless people will die for the hunger if some of our offsprings
2.0	All in All, for the reason above, we can safely conclude that it's not so important for the governmant to protect the wild animals and wilderness areas.
3.0	The rapid life pace tends to make people hard to breath now that they are faced with diverse choices and potential challenge.
3.0	People gradually feel stressed in their daily life.
3.0	So they now are less content with their lives than people were in the past?
3.0	I totally disagree with the opinion mentioned above.
11.0	From my point of view, our life is more brilliant and hopful than what it used to be.
10.0	There are some reasons in the following.
5.0	Fristly,the living conditions of people have been greatly improved than any other times.
8.0	Noadays, people live a life provided sufficent food, elaborate clothing, convenient transportation and a safe and sound house to live in.
8.0	There is no need to for people to worry about the starvation, coldness, long distance and tired journey to travel and homeless problem.
8.0	What's more, with the high pace development and gradual improvement of the Internet, it becomes easier and easier for people to get the information they need.
8.0	Maybe what troubles usis that the vast amount of useless and ingenuine information will confuse us.
8.0	But the automatical intellectal vcan help people to sort out the infromation people want.
8.0	In this way, people will be far pleased because of the convenience of life.
5.0	Seconly, people is likely to have the chance to choose their own lifestyle and interests.
8.0	In such a rushed society, the  world works in a more efficient way, which thus makes it possible that people have more leisure time for themselves to explore.
8.0	in this condition, people will apply their private time to develop their potential.
8.0	people can only go to sleep because they don't have light or amusing events to do  in the past.
8.0	But now there are enough equipments  that helps people to develop their own interests.
8.0	And they also can earn more money to support their hobbies and interests.
8.0	By developing their interests, they can attain more happieness and fulfillment from the process.
10.0	Thirldly, people
12.0	Well,when referring to this kinds of problems whether watching a movie or reading a book is better than physical exercise.
11.0	The opinions are individual to individual.
11.0	As for me,I agree the former is better than latter.
11.0	The following are my reasons.
6.0	The first one is that we can lead a different kinds of life by movies or books.
8.0	As it is known to all,the books and movies are crystals of human's wisdom so we are able to use imaginary to put ourselves in a special position.
8.0	By envisioning we are the indispensible person in books or movies,we can experience a series of adventures or have many total diffrent personalities.
8.0	Then,we can forget what we are and what difiiculties we are facing.
8.0	Gradually,we start to experience other's intersting life.
8.0	So that we can relive our pressure in an unaware way that physical exercise cannot achieve at all.
0.0	The other reason is that movies and books can let us relax in a mental way not physical and exercise may lead to get hurt.
0.0	It is universally acknowledged that too much severe exercise will consume many energy and we will eat many things to acquire it.
0.0	As the amount of the things we eat increased,we will get fat and it is easier to get hurt when we exercise.
10.0	Of course,mental health are more prodominant than phsical .
7.0	Our body is controled by brains ,only when we relax mentally ca
3.0	Currently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among parents, should children be rewarded money after getting high grade?
3.0	Opinions vary from person to person.
11.0	Some claims that children may waste money on  some bad things.
11.0	However, contrary to their view comes my perspective that children should be offered money for each high mark, which can be fully elaborated by the following reasons.
4.0	Firstly, rewarding money enables children to study better.
8.0	As we all know, we are more likely to be encouraged by the things we are longing for, which is the same to children.
8.0	If they have some money, they can buy whatever they want without permission.
8.0	This happiness will urge them to make more efforts to study and win the reward next time.
8.0	Take my own experience to illustrate it.
8.0	When I was in the middle school, I was so eager to buy a newest pencilcase.
8.0	I told my mother about my little wish, and she promise me if I can obtain high marks in the coming math test, she would give me money to buy that pencilcase.
8.0	Thus, I was so hard-working that I won the money.
4.0	Moreover, having money could develope children's confidence.
8.0	As many psychologists says, childhood could determine one's personality and innership.
8.0	Imagine the students in school all have lots of pocket-money, but a child have no money.
8.0	He may be laughted by his classmates, and become low desplined.
8.0	On the contrary, if he owned a sum of money he earned, the boy is less likely to admire others, but form a healthy personailty.
4.0	Admittedly, children have not form mature values, so they may spend money on viedio games, or junk foods, which would make bad effects to them.
9.0	Nontheless, parents can adujust the quentities  of money they give to children.
9.0	Maybe ten yuan a week is suitable, and children cannot use this buy the bad things.
0.0	To put it into a nutshell, children should be rewared money.
0.0	On the one hand, money is a good incentive to children's study.
0.0	On the other hand, having money is an essential part to constitue children's personality.
3.0	Whether group works can help students to learn more efficiently is a purely personal questions.
3.0	Some people like to work in a group while others like to work in individuals.
12.0	In my opnion, I disagree work in a group cna help us leanr mroe efiicient because when are learning in a group, we will have a lots of distractions from others or sometimes we are trying to get a free-ride from others and then we can learn nothng.
5.0	Firstly, in a group projects, we are going to get a lots of distractions from others.
8.0	There are people who like to keep talking to their friends in the group or there are someone that lways force others to accept his or her opinion even he or she is wrong.
8.0	However, if we are working in indiviuals, there will be no distractons from other people.
8.0	For example, once I was doing a group project in my middle school, at that time we were asked to analyze a Chinese poem.
8.0	At the beginning there were two people that kept talking loud which freuqently disturb my from my own work, and even if we asked them to stop, they did not stop and talked even louder.
8.0	It took a long time for us to complete because of their loud conversation.
8.0	Later on, when we were sharing our ideas, there was one person kept talking about his own opinion and used stupid reasons to dismiss others opinion even his point was wrong and that mislead all of us and we submitted a very bad projects and I barely learned anything about the poem.
8.0	Therefore, group study cannot always outweight individual studying.
5.0	Furthermore, sometime when we feel lazy when we are participting in a group project, we just want to get a free ride from others and then we cannot learn anything.
8.0	On the other hand, when we are doing things by ourselves, we are forcing to finish the work individually and there is no way for us to depend on others to finish te work.
8.0	For instance, one of my friends was working with me and two other group member to do a research about of an article.
8.0	He was really reluctant to work on this project at first so he just letting the resting of our group to finish the job.
8.0	On the other day there is a test about this research, because my friend did not work on this research at all, so he eventually failed the test because he did nt learn anything from these group work.
8.0	So, group project are not always the best choice for students to learn effectively because when we are just depend on others to finish the project, we cannot learn anything from it.
2.0	Comparing the disadvantages that study in group have to the advantages that individual work has, group project are not always the bet choice to help students learn effectively.
3.0	Nowadays,some parents offer their school-age children money based on they get the grade in school.
12.0	some people think it's not a good way to encounge children to get grade because children may be make some mistake to cheat parents but others think it's very useful to increase power for children because childrencan get more money to do something what they want.
12.0	but i think it's posetive for us,which can not noly meaningful and interseting,but also making us have interest in studying.
6.0	When we talk about the grade the first thing come into my mind is that it's very important for us to have a brilliant future.
8.0	so parents also compare my grades with others,but i don't have any power to improve my grade.
8.0	but  i can get more money if i improve my grades ,l will have enough power to do something then i think according this way children will have a think that i can get what i want though my effort ,let's have a positive attitude to do everything which can not only useful for us to built confidence ,but also improve ourselves besides l think parents offer children more money according their high grade when they get in examation .
8.0	it's a good way for parents wo increase attention to their children.
8.0	there have more conversation between parents and children so that it will have a better relationship last but not least in this way the society will have more and more postive effective.
8.0	people will have sense of competition which is useful for our country to improve the economy and society power so that our country will have more power to competitive in internation world  As far as i an concern ,it's a positive way for children and parents even our country,l think this is a good idea.
3.0	In this demanding society, it is not easy to make friends because of the fast pace that people socialize.
3.0	Whenever asked whether the ability to maintain friendships with a few friends over a long time is more important than the ability to make new friends easily considering happiness, people usually exhibit an air of unertainty.
12.0	However, I totally disagree with this statement.
4.0	To begin with, people do change, so they need new friends from time to time.
8.0	During the process of working and studying, people can change a lot that their old friends may not remain the same as they were.
8.0	So when people are exposed to different environment for a long time, they may have totally different opinions toward one thing.
8.0	Apparently, this will cause awkwardness or even conflicts.
8.0	Then, when they stay together, they may not be as happy as before.
8.0	In this situation, people need to make some new friends who they can talk with without misunderstanding easily.
8.0	In this way, they will still have some friends that can make them happy in time.
8.0	Isn't this a good thing?
4.0	Then, people need to socialize with different kinds of people instead of staying in their comfort zones connecting with just a few old friends.
8.0	As people grow older, they will meet a lot of different people, they have to make friends with these people may be because their daily life or their career.
8.0	Anyway, if people can make new friends easily, then people around them may consider them very friendly and are more willing to help them when they are in need.
8.0	In this way, people who can make new friends easily can go more smoothly when they enter the society.
4.0	Last but not the least, making new friends easily can also give people a sense of happiness, which is not less than the happiness they gain from maintaining old friendships.
8.0	When people explore for new friends, they can always meet some interesting people they never expected to meet.
8.0	If they can make friends with these people, it can be very surprising and can also give people a different sense of happiness because they don't have this kind of friends before.
8.0	Because a feeling of freshness always can bring a feeling of happiness.
2.0	To conclude, I admit that the ability to maintain friendships with some old friends can be important, but the ability to make new friends easily can never be less important.
3.0	There're plenty of methods that parents encourage children to study harder, such as oral praise, sending presents, taking out to have a fun and so on.
3.0	Many people think offering money can be a good choice for its convenience and feasibility——chiledren can buy whaterver they want and parents needn't to waste time in picking presents.
12.0	However, in the ultimate analysis, I contend that we parents shoulden't offer children money for high grades, from the consideration of children's healthy frowth.
4.0	In the first place, the main aim of students is study, and its thier natural suty to get high grades.
9.0	If behavior well in school can get concrete material rewards, students' purpose will lack purity and the complexity will decrease their motivation on study.
9.0	What's worse, when one gets used to being praised by money, once withdraw the rewards, students will not work as hard as before.
4.0	Second, giving too many rights to student and letting them dominate thier money randomly may forster some bad habits such as extravagance, waste, being wilful and arrogant, which do harm to childen's growth.
10.0	And since the habits developed, it's hard for parents to correct.
4.0	Last but not least, indeed, student can gain sense of money from taking charge of thier own property, however barely had students have abilities to control themselves properly.
10.0	And gaining money from parents may dim the original function of thier parents——they may treat parents like bank rather than kinsfolk, and it's not benificial for a whole family's unity.
1.0	There's a popular proverb in America that says: A boy lured by candy won't be grateful.
1.0	To encourage children, there are many methods better than giving money directly.
10.0	Using more wisdom and being careful can contribute the growth of one's kid a lot.
3.0	Currently, there is a widespread view that success is the most important.
11.0	However, from my perspective, it is more important to remain happy and optimistic when you fail.
5.0	At first, remaining optimistic increases the possibility that you could succeed in the next time.
8.0	To be specific, you will be upset and frustrated when you fail in something.
8.0	If you are eager to solve that problem, you need to have a positive attitude.
8.0	That is to say,  having an optimistic attitude, you are calm enough to analyze the mistakes made in the past so that you could come up with some practical methods.
8.0	In this way, you are able to try again with experience and confidence, leading to success.
8.0	On the contrary, if you get confused and sad when you fail.
8.0	Without doubt, you could not come through it and make it worse.
8.0	Set myself as an example, Once I failed in my math test which others think it is too easy to pass.
8.0	I decided to keep happy and optimistic and find out solutions myself.
8.0	Quickly, I found that I just did not understand some math equations.
8.0	I learnt them again and again.
8.0	As a result, I passed the test.
5.0	Secondly, a happy mood prevents you from dealing with the mental issue.
8.0	As we know, modern people are stressed out and nervous all the time, leading to an unhealthy mental condition.
8.0	And you may fail many times when you try to do something difficult.
8.0	If you cannot get yourself relaxed under the overwhelmed pressure, you doubt yourself whether you could finish your job in time.
8.0	That may cause further concern.
8.0	Finally, when you cannot stand that level of pressure, you have to stop all your work and go to see a doctor.
8.0	That is not worthwhile.
8.0	Set my friend as an example, he is the most understanding person in my generation.
8.0	But he is afraid of failure to an incredible extent.
8.0	When he doesn't win the championship in a competition, he even cries in his bedroom.
8.0	Now, he is in the hospital and cannot work with his colleges anymore.
2.0	All in all, keeping happy and optimistic when you fail is more important.
7.0	In this way, you can not only get prepared for next trail but also be happy
3.0	Associatall with the development of necessary for high-degree human resources, parents are thinking more about which is the best choise for the whole family.
11.0	As a result, parents wonder weather or not is better to give their children which need to go to school for each high grade (mark) they go to school.
11.0	I believe that both side have sound foundations.
12.0	People assume different attitudes towards this issue.
5.0	Advocates of residing in view that is better to only offer their school-age children money for each high grade (mark) they get in school hold the belief that there are numerous benifits of it.
8.0	First, it an avoid the resources wasted.
8.0	By this i mean some of children are really bad at studing, so it is also a good idear that parents encourage them to do what they want.
8.0	And then, they can get a job,and have their own life.
8.0	Secondly, children which already get high grade (mark) is easier to graduat successfully.
5.0	On the other hand, there also are lots of reason that tell us it is not good actually.
8.0	Firstly, it is unfare for the children who just havelow grade (mark) but still want to go th school.
8.0	This situation that parents only give their children which need to go to school for each high grade (mark) they go to school is a croul.
8.0	As wo can image, children have to give up going to school because of low grade (mark).
10.0	I
7.0	n general, I
3.0	At present, with the development of education, an increasing number of people focus on student's courses.
3.0	They all want to student to study some useful subjects.
11.0	Some people contend that University students should not take hisroty courses.
11.0	Others are in favor of the viewpoint that no matter what students studying is, they all should take history courses.
12.0	Nonetheless, I prefer the latter view.
12.0	My reasons and examples arelisted as follows.
5.0	Initially, studying history courses, university students will acquire a large number of motivations.
8.0	This is because in the human history, a great number of people contribute their life for their society and their belief.
8.0	Thus this examples will motivate unversity students to be hard working in their field.
8.0	For instance, when I was a university student, I fall in love with art history.
8.0	This is owing to the fact that in the art history, I can find some tallent artists who use their whole life to finish their art works.
8.0	T
5.0	An equally significant fact is that gaining history courses, students would understant their targets.
8.0	This is due to the fact that in the history, a huge amount of people will dedicate their time to one thing, which is very important for them.
8.0	Therfore, they can be successful in their fields because they are very persisting in one thing.
8.0	Supposing that a student study history, they will study this character incloud persisting, tough, and virtuous.
8.0	This student would also success in the future.
8.0	For example, my Chinese teacher like to read history book when he is a unversity student.
8.0	additionally, he insterested in Chinese history about Congfusion who is a very famous teacher in ancient China.
8.0	Hence, he also want to be a teacher when he was a university.
8.0	Now he thinks he make a right choice and he very enjoy his job.
2.0	Undoubtedlly, taking history courses would spend some time.
7.0	This is because student wil
11.0	In my opinion, I believe it is a good idea that parents give their school-age children money for great performance on study.
12.0	This is a good method to encourage students to work hard at school and also save money for parents.
5.0	At first, young age students mostly do not understand why they need to work hard to get good grades.
8.0	They feel like parents are force them to study and I blieve most of them would like to play instead of study.
8.0	Money reward is a good reason for them to set goals for themselves and tell them what they can get if they achieve good grades on exams.
8.0	Once students have goals, it is easier for themselves to understand the importance of study; although is for money at that time, it still help them improve their grades.
8.0	At least they are studying for themselves instead of their parents.
8.0	And they are able to buy the things they want.
5.0	Secondly, I think this is a good way for parents to save money.
8.0	I usually ask my parents to buy toys for me when I was young; there were a lot of toys that I like, so I begged them to buy it everytime I saw a new toy.
8.0	My mother relaize that it was too expensive to buy so many toys, so she decided to let me buy it for myselve.
8.0	She told me that she would give me 5 dollars if I get 90 out of 100 on a exam and I can save those money to buy toys.
8.0	I tried hard to achieve the goal, so I can buy my favorite things.
8.0	Also, I started to think about save money, so I can buy the one toy I like the most.
8.0	I understood how difficult I got those money, I should think carfully about which toy I want most instead of buy them all.
8.0	In this way, my mother did not need to spend a large amount of money for me to buy toys.
8.0	I improved my grades and also got the toys I want.
8.0	It is a  win-win situation.
8.0	Money reward provides parents a good way to give out spend money to their children.
8.0	Children need to use their effort to earn money instead  of ask for money without doing anything.
8.0	Also, parents will have excuse to say no when their children ask for something becuase now their children have the ability to buy it by themselves.
0.0	Overall, Money reward to school-age children based on their grades is a good idea.
0.0	This method helps student to know that they are studying for themselves and they have to work hard if they want to achieve the goal.
0.0	Also, parents can gain advantages from this method by let their children to use the money reward to buy things they like.
3.0	If I meet a mistake made by my teacher and the meeting leader in a classroom or a meeting, I will choose to stand to interrupt and correct it.
12.0	Because some meeting, such as a acadmy or a meeting in the company before the new products getting into the market or even an ordinary class, are so important that we cannot just let the mitake continue.
11.0	We may not have enough time to correct it or the mistakes may just become a truth in some people's brain.
5.0	First, some people argue that we can just wait until the meeting is over.
8.0	But in some conditions, time won't permit us to do this.
8.0	For example, before Apple announced it products, the Mactonish to the market, it held a meeting in the company, in the meeting the manager repeated the most important things of the products.
8.0	But a technical employee found a mistake in tyoe of the product but he didn't choose to metnion that right away.
8.0	Then, when the meeting was over, everyone was busy with announcing the products to the market tomorrow and the manager almost had no time to listen the suggestions of the worker.
8.0	So the products sold very badly and this became a disaster to the Apple.
8.0	The time was so important that  we must say this mistakes to the meeting leader.
5.0	Secondly, some meeting are held once a year or even longer.
8.0	If you missed the chance to mention the mistake, the mistake will be a truth for others.
8.0	Take Newton for an instance, when he entered a meeting of all physical scientists around the world.
8.0	He found a mistake in the calcultion of a famous scientist.
8.0	But he thought this is not that important so he chose to say nothing.
8.0	But when Newton returned to his lab and continued his own research.
8.0	He found out that the calcultion mistake existed in all embassy wrote by other physical scientists because they didn't find the mistake and they just seemed the mistake as something right.
8.0	And it took Newton much time in the next meeting which is held three years later to explain it to other scientists.
0.0	Lastly, we must noticed that class and the meeting are places that we learn knowledge.
0.0	We cannot just let the mistake go because this is disrespect to knowledge.
0.0	In some university, students can talk and discuss as a group, and if you don't mentions the mistake which is made by another teammate, they will think this is your fault, because you don't respect knowledgeand your team
3.0	Nowdays，many contury attch important to education to child.
3.0	when child is a baby, his parents has begun to educate him.
3.0	They could tell him his mistakes and ask him to correct his mistakes.
3.0	they could tell child it is wrong, child can learn something.
3.0	He could not do it again.
3.0	However, some peoples think it is stupid.
11.0	I believe that we should teach child,tell him his mistakes.
5.0	first, if child takes a mistake, we do not tell him in time.
8.0	He may think he is correct.
8.0	So, he could take mistakes again and again.
8.0	In thie way, the child can accumulate experence preventing him or her from committing mistake when facing the same problem alone in the future.
8.0	The parents should tell him what should be dane or not.
8.0	The child can remanber this is not.
5.0	Second, a little mistake could may child's life.
7.0	Because child
3.0	I disagree with the statement that it is better to get relaxed by staying at home watching TV or reading  books than by doing exercise.
3.0	First of all,doning exercise can make us stronger,which is essential for us to be relaxed.
3.0	A strong body is to our happiness what sunshine is to flowers.
3.0	Doing exercise is indispensable when we are in a high pressure situation.
3.0	For example,one time when I got a mission to play dulcimer at an openning performance in a nationwide competition,the anxciety overwhelming me.
3.0	Time was limitted and it was a nightmare.
3.0	To relaxed myself,I just went outside and took exercise,it turned out that I felt better almost immediantly.
6.0	In the second place,nowadys a scientific research shows that doing exercise  can help people to secrete a thing that can asist  people with releasing their pressures.
10.0	The majority of people attend the experiment with a computer to analysing the level of their pressure before and after they doing exercise,the consequence shows that people always feel more relaxed and comfortable after they take a certain exercise.
2.0	Admittedly,staying at home watching TV or reading books does make contribution for people to relax themselves,but thing not always goes like that.
10.0	In most situation when people are confronted with high pressure,they always feel anxious or nervous or even mad,which results that they cannot just sit down calmly to concentrate on TV or books,it is more possible for them to become more and more anxious when they are in a limited room alne,when this happens,the best way for them to relaese their pressuer is to go out of the door and to see the beautiful blue sky.
7.0	that will help them
11.0	With the provement of the society, people are eager to pay more attention on the education.
12.0	Concerning to the situation mentioned above, some people hold the view that parents should not offer their children money for high grade, while others in favor of it.
12.0	As for me, I side with the former.
5.0	At First, there is no doubt that to get high grade is the children' responsbility from which the students benefit.
8.0	what is more, parent just like hire their children to finish their study, which is harmful to their growing.
8.0	Take me sa the example, once my parent give my money to get high grade in school, I lost mself in the award.
8.0	With the time going by, I totally forget the intesion of the study.
8.0	Moreover, I have no idea to layout my future for I just study for money in the past.
8.0	That is to say, I lost interset in studying and forget to be a outstanding man.
8.0	Therefore, we can know that the money can only get high grade in a while.
8.0	However, you can not get high grade in your life.
5.0	In addition, the children are too young to have the money.
10.0	In other words, they may lost thenmselves in the comoputer game even drugs.
12.0	From parents' perspectives,giving money is a most convenient way to tell their children they have done a really good job at school,and the children who receive this kind of encouragement would work hard and do better next time.
12.0	So I believe it's a good idea for parents to offer money for their children's high mark.
6.0	First thing I want to mention is that money,as many other objectives,has a real impact on children's minds.
8.0	They can know how well they can do according to how much money they get.
8.0	The more they get,the better they have done.
8.0	Money sometimes can be regarded as a measurement that
3.0	With the development of the society and the goverment, the government pay more attention to make their city more comfrotable for people to live and they pay a lot of  revenue in public transportation and environment protection.
3.0	Moreover they also pay some money to some new field like the Internet because they have very huge benefits to the finacial income of the goverment.
12.0	So I think these two fields have same importance.
6.0	Firstly, to improve the public transportation will make the life of the citizen become more comfortable and convinened.
8.0	Nowadays, the city have too much people and the traffic jungle is very common and it bring very huge uncomfortable to people's life.
8.0	For example, in our city I always meet the traffic jungle and that always let me late at school.
8.0	Fortunatelly,  the goverment pay a lot money to built the city subway system so I can go to school by subway; it not only save me a lot of time but also give me a very enjoyable time when I in the subway.
8.0	So it is truly very necessary for the goverment to spend money on the public transportation.
8.0	Moreover to improve the city public transportation will also improve the environment quality of the city.
8.0	In the past the city did not have very development public transportation so people choosed the family cars to go out.
8.0	These private cars will release aboundant damage things to the air and these damage things will pollute the atmosphere.
8.0	Thus, the air quality in our city is very bad but when the public transportation is development, people all chose the subway and the bus.
8.0	So the number of the private cars is decrease and our sky become more blue than before.
8.0	All of us think that we live a more comfortable city than before and we thanks to goverment a lot.
1.0	Second, the internet will bring a lot of financial benefits to the government because nowadays the statue of the internet become higher and higher.
1.0	We cannot imagine to live without the internet; we pay by internet and buy things by internet.
7.0	In our country, because most of us choose the Taoba In
11.0	As far as I am concerned,this may not be a good way to educate children.
12.0	If parents do this all the time,the children will recieve an impression that marking high grades equals to getting money paid.
12.0	But in the real life it is obviously not like that.
12.0	Children must know that getting good grades is their goal but not their work,they must fight for it but not get paid from it.
12.0	Children can benifit from learning but it dosen't mean they can get money only through studying hard and mark high grades.
6.0	Parents have to tell their children that learning and studying is for themselves but not anything else.
8.0	Only in that way can children try to learn willingly but not for the profits.
8.0	Parents can teach their sons and daughters that knowledges represent for wealth while good grades don't.
8.0	I remember a friend of mine who was given money when he get good grades at school,he didn't want to learn after his parents stop giving him any money.
8.0	I think that is ridiculous.
8.0	Studying is not for money,not for your parents but for ourselves.
8.0	When you get good grades,you can feel happy and proud,but it just means you are good enough during a short period.
8.0	Everybody wants a good life but not a good short period.
8.0	Life is long,and of course life is much more than just studying.
8.0	So parents can give their children encouragements when they do well at school or take them to play to recognize thier hardwork,but not through money.
0.0	So let the children know the importance of studying is the main task parents have to do,but giving money is not a brilliant idea.
0.0	School-age children don't have a correct impression on money,and parents shouldn't reward their children is such an adult way.
0.0	Rewarding is needed,but how to reward is a question.
0.0	So just stop giving your children money for thier good appearence and change a new way.
11.0	It is generally acknowlaged that children do need incentive to study more diligently.
12.0	And some people offer money as reward for high grade to propel their children to study hard.
11.0	As far as I am concerned, it is a good way to motivate children.
6.0	First of all, it is efficient to encourage children in this way.
8.0	Children always have something that they want to buy, while it is general that they have far less desire in studying.
8.0	Therefore, you can converse their desire for the toy to the desire to study.
8.0	Instead buy it for them instantly, if you determind to give them money for their grade, they will be more eager to study.
8.0	However someone may argue that children is studying for money but not for the improvement of their capibility.
8.0	But in my opinion, the purpose does not matter, for the improvement does exist no matter what are them studying for.
2.0	What is more, we give our children an opportunity to manage their money.
9.0	The only way for our children to get their toy is to win the reward and it may be not enough for the toy, so they must learn how to save money and burget.
9.0	By this way, they can not only learn what is essential for their future life, but also it saves parents' money.
12.0	when parents want to encorange their children to behavior better in class ,more and more money and other prizes will be offered .
12.0	i hold a critical thinking about it ,and i would like to share it with you .
6.0	the reason why parents do this is that grades and points are becomimg the  only way to evaluate students.
8.0	this is resulted from the focus and pressure from the whole scoiety .
8.0	besides,it's necessary for students to manage their own financial area.
8.0	on the one hand ,it may be a good way to response to their efforts positively and instantly.
8.0	in this way ,they will be more and more hardworking.
8.0	however, i am also afraid of the consequence.
8.0	if we concentrate too much on grades ,other talents and development will be ignored ,so that they will face difficulty in fitting in the real life and career.
8.0	at the same time ,money shouldn't be the only criterion for praise.
8.0	maybe you can provide them with something to do with their minds.
8.0	for instance,you can spend more time in accompanying them .
8.0	in my opinoin,this is more educational and wonderful.
11.0	With the development of society, the pressure of our life is becoming more and more heavy.
12.0	Hence, a controversial debate has been raised, which is that it is important or not for us to know the events around the world even it ls not incfluencing to our lifes.
12.0	When it comes to this topic, differernt individuals hold different view.
12.0	As to me, I believe that the evens happening around world derserve our attentions, not matter they affects our lifes or not.
4.0	To begin with, knowing the worldwide events helps us to keep in touch with the world.
8.0	Imagine that one does not care what is happening in the world everyday, as a result of which he does not understand the world well.
8.0	Nowadays, our society changes every mintue, once he neglect the events what is happening, he will lose touch with the world.
8.0	As for me, a undergraduate student, read newspapers every morning in different aspects, like science & technology and sports, in different regions, like North America and Asian.
8.0	I am so small when compared with the big world , but reading newspapers let me in touch with the world.
4.0	Additionally, knowing about what is happening helps us to adjust and adapt to the changing world.
8.0	Everything nowadays develops and updates so fast in the Information Age.
8.0	Seriously speaking, ignoring the events one day may impact our life.
8.0	I will take my self as an example.
8.0	The no-cash payment (Ali Pay) develops swift in China.
8.0	Because of out touch of the event, I bought a cup of tea by cash.
8.0	But there were no cash in the counter to give the change.
4.0	Admittedly, keeping in touch with the worldwide events may takes some time.
8.0	But is easy to solve this problem.
8.0	We have many leisure time with nothing to do.
8.0	Why not do something like reading the news instead of killing the time.
8.0	For example, when we stand in the bus stops waiting for the bus, we can read the news on the smartphone.
1.0	To sum up, it is obvious that it is vital to know about the events happening aroud the word.
1.0	Not only for keeping touch with the world, but also adapt to the changing world, Even though the events is not influential
11.0	As far as I am concerned, it isn't a wise measure to offer school-age children money for each high grade.
12.0	It goes without thinking that if you punished your children when they get a bad grade, they would gradully get tired and even hate studing.
12.0	The reson why the money reward is not efficient is that it change the value of studing into a kind of material profits.
6.0	Seemingly, offering chidren with money or something they want is a encouragement and stimulant to their better performance, but there are some disadvantages of it.
8.0	First, since they are not so mature in mental, it is easy for them to misunderstand the value of learning.
8.0	It can't be avoided that they will simply equal learning to an approach to gain material benefits.
8.0	Second, it is also a burden to parents that because of children's dependence on this kind of rewards which they take for granted.
8.0	You will find it possible that children ask for more rewards when they get a little advance in grade.
8.0	Third, they may be interested in learing and try their best in learning out of the reason that they prefer it sincerely.
8.0	It is the reward that change their motivation from inside reason into outside reason.
2.0	There is no doubt that children will get more real benefits from learning if they are learning out of their interests and love.
7.0	Also, not everyone having a high grade is definiteli
3.0	I disagree with the statement.
3.0	It is a consensus that human beings today are losing their convictions as well as their humanity.
12.0	Individuals attach more and more importance to themselves than anything else which unfortunately isolate each other from being united.
11.0	People are no longer willing to help the struggling strangers as they would do before.
6.0	When I was in high school, I once read on the newspaper that a baby girl named Xiao Yueyue were somehow left on the street where cars as well as other transportations ran on.
8.0	The baby was there for several hours before someone came to aid.
8.0	And at that time, she was breathing weakly, almost dead.
8.0	Indeed, there were a few of people passing by, about 18 in total.
8.0	Nevertheless, none of them stopped by and checked whether the baby was okay.
8.0	They just walked straight on as if they hadn't seen the baby at all.
8.0	What struck me most was that the newspaper said that some of the cars just run over on the baby girl without feeling anything unproper.
8.0	Cars are heavy, especially for a baby like Xiao Yueyue.
8.0	Those drivers shouldn't have passed over her like nothing happened whether in an ethical point or in a legal perspective.
8.0	Those passers-by just cared about themselves and didn't want to get involved in other people's life even if it's just a few minutes for them to call an ambulance.
8.0	I couldn't help signing when I read this news.
8.0	People are getting colder to others.
0.0	Admittedly, with the rapid development of science and technology, we human beings seem to live a better life than any other period in the history.
0.0	But that is just for the material life, what about the spirital life.
0.0	Considering the spirital life, we seem to be poorer even compared to the ancient people.
8.0	They didn't own much in materials, but they created civilization as they passed through generations.
8.0	They knew how to respect the old as well as care for the young, they also knew to offer food to the weak.
8.0	Look back into ourselves, we are not willing to help the struggling strangers anymore since we focus on our own interests.
8.0	If that is not sad, I don't know what is.
3.0	Nowadays, many parents offer money as a way of acceletating their children to get good grades.
11.0	Here I would like to say something about my own opinion towards this phenomenon.
5.0	First, the benefits are obvious that children will study harder in order to attain good grades which also means more money.
8.0	One the one hand, the enthusiasm of students are inspired which is beyond doubt, on the other hand, children get money will realize their small hopes using the money from parents.
8.0	It seems to be a proper cycle that children will always try hard to get high marks to get money thus buying something they want.
8.0	However, not all children are willing to sacrifice the time to play for studying, and in fact a large number of children can usually get what he wants making the way not so attractive.
8.0	Children themself might form the idea that they just do not want to get money when they are supposed to study as usual.
8.0	That apparently lead to the wrong road.
5.0	From my own perspective, I am not favour of the idea to use money to force children to study harder.
8.0	As a matther of fact, children should know the significance and necessity of studying instead of being passive.
8.0	"Just as the old saying goes ""interest is the best teacher"", what parents should do is gradually leading children to realize the beauty behind the knowledge which will constantly attracts them to know more and learn more."
8.0	At that time, good grades are for sure when the children are not forced to do the thing he dislikes, even without the money for good maks.
1.0	Giving money to make children study may come into effect in a short time, but it will actually confuse the children what study means to them.
1.0	For children, they are supposed to understand that getting good grades is secondary and knowing the seneries behind the grades is much more fasinating.
3.0	Nowadays, the world is improving rapidly.
3.0	The people gradually update their transportations from horses to cars, planes or trains.
11.0	I agree with the statement which states that there will be fewer cars in the furture for several reasons.
4.0	First of all, in the past, the car will never be thought by our ancestors because it is impossible for them to bulit one.
8.0	Little by little, they know how to ride a horse, how to make a wheel, then we have the coach.
8.0	After that, our technology are develpoing extremely fast at that time and then, someone invented the car which was a miracle.
8.0	But now, cars are everywhere.
8.0	It shows that we will have more advanced technique to make some new transportation which is more efficient than the car right now.
8.0	So, in the future, cars will be abandoned by people because we may have small air crafts for our transportations.
8.0	The car will be just like the horse in the people who live in the furture.
4.0	In addition, cars need to use the gasoline to start their enginees and work which can produce plenty of pollution like CO2 which can impact the enovironment so hard.
10.0	In the future, we may have already run out all of our resource including fossil fuel, so although you have a car, you can't use it, so why people have to buy it?
4.0	Moreover, the government may spend a lot in the expenditure of the public transportations which means that we can take bus, subway or other public transports anywhere.
9.0	So people wuld not take the private cars because it is more easier and cheaper for them to take a bus to work than driving cars by themselves.
9.0	If you can take bus to anywhere, why do you bother to drive by yourself?
2.0	In conclusion, I agree with the idea which says that people will use less cars in the future
11.0	I think children must make mistake.
11.0	Fist,In my opinion, the parents should give children a chance konw which thing is right and which is wrong rather than directle tell them what to do.
12.0	Mistakes are the part of life.
11.0	The things we learn from mistakes have more effect on us than only konwing it is wrong.
11.0	Everyone should be given a time to tell right from wrong,especially in their young age.,When children were born to this world, they had no sence of right or wrong.
8.0	They only do the things which they think can make them feel stisfied.
8.0	So we should let them know what they are doing will do harm,rather than telling them not to do so.
8.0	For example,children will hit their parents to hve fun,if we tell them not to do so,they will think we are only joking.
8.0	We must show them it can hurt people after they doing this.
8.0	Only Mistakes can rise the awareness of right and wrong.
5.0	Also ,as far as I am concerned, mistakes are the best teacher.
8.0	Only mistakes can make children know not everything is this world go well all the time , there can be mistakes and rough time.
8.0	If children never make mistakes ,they will never learn anything ,and there will be no improvement.
8.0	They should know it is okay to make mistakes or failed,and one shoule be forgiven after knowing what they are doing is wrong and correct the mistakes.
5.0	Third, mistakes can make one more independent.
9.0	After making a mistakes ,the one could fix it is the one who made it.
9.0	From making up from themselves ,thet will know how to over com dificulties.
0.0	So,i think ,parents should let their children make mistakes and learn from them.
0.0	Because mistakes is one of the most important procceses in every human beings' life.
0.0	Not alowing make mistakes will not only make a silly kid but also make a kid dependent.
11.0	I agree with this opinion.
12.0	For an instance, when I meet beggars during my vacation togather with my parents, I always show more sympathy than my parents.
12.0	What interesting as well as inspiring, many of my friends share the same feeling and the fact makes me believe that people today are more willing to help the struggling strangers.
5.0	From my perspactive, one main reason is that as we developed fast during the past few years, the majority of china citizen's life quality grown with leaps and bounds.
8.0	As is popularly accepted by philosophers, men are always more willing to give others a hand when they lead a happy life without worrying whether he has anything to eat tomorrow.
8.0	Taking this into acount, it would be more easier to understand why peoople are more willing to show their mercy towards truggling strangers than they used to be five or ten years ago.
8.0	Just imagine, when a beggar appear in front of your door and you only have a small piece of bread but a large family to raise, would you share your bread with that beggar?
8.0	But what if you are a billionare living in a huge warm house together with piles of servants?
5.0	Another reason why I believe that people now are more willing to help the struggling strangers is that while the developement of education and civilization carrying forward, people become more and more well-behaved as well as kind-hearted.
9.0	After being well educated by school and family, webecome easier to understand others' feeling, more willing to help others, and are more probable to get help from others.
9.0	And Istrongly believe, as long as we keep on helping others from the bottom of our hearts, a highly-civilized warm socirty shall be biult one day.
12.0	As we know, the courses is very flexible in the univerity, but some universities let all the students take the history courses.
11.0	Some people think that it is  opprotunity for the student to learn history about the country, because history can let us know how the country created or what happed in the country before.
11.0	However, some people think that it is unuseful for the student to learn, because the student needn't to know these knowledge.
11.0	Personally, I believe that students can not take the history courses, because it is unfair for all the students.
4.0	To begin with, let student who is not in that field, which is waste their time.
8.0	For example, if the student is science field, but he need to learn the history, which is hlepless for his study field and it will waste his time to learn his major study field.
8.0	He can use this time to learn some his major, and maybe can find some new science theories.
8.0	Therefore, the student shouldn't take the history courses whether or not their study field.
4.0	Secondly, some students are not good at history.
8.0	If force them to learn history, it will influence their GPA.
8.0	For instance, the student is not good at history courses, so he chose other courses to improve his grade, but if the university said he must take history, he have no choice.
8.0	Maybe the end of semeste, his grade will very low, even fail this course.
4.0	Lastly, administry, History is very important, which can let us know a lot of informantion that we don't know before.
9.0	It is helpful for the student to learn about own courtry.
9.0	However, I think if let all the university student to take history course, it is very unfail, because is not everyone are good at history.
10.0	All in all, I thinl
3.0	It is not a uncommon phenomenon that whenever we gang out on the highway or walk in the suburbs, there are always countless chaotic vehicles.
3.0	The numerous volume of traffic that will prodece a lot of carbon dioxide emissions and exhaust fumes, enabling people breath poisonous polluted air.
3.0	Consequently, people have to wear masks in order to aviod the dilemma.
12.0	Faced with the awkard situation, I have the prolong conviction that in twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today..
5.0	First of all, with the improvement of living standard, people's awareness of sustainable development and ecologucal equilibrium will become strong.
8.0	Therefore, there is no doubt that individuals will bear in mind that participate in eco-friendly campaign.
8.0	For instance, many organized offical instituations in my neighbourhood implement the activity called Sustainable Development.
8.0	The organation is aimed to appeal more local inhabitants and environmentalists to call upon that using fewer cars and walking more.
8.0	Thanks to walking is a favarable avenue to save sources and protect our enviromnent, more and more people are willing to response to the call.
8.0	Therefore, it will make a chain reaction that people use fewer cars on account of protecting ecology.
5.0	On top of that, finding a suitable parking place is always inconvinent for a lot of people, so if we take subway or bus, we can easily tackle the tricky condition.
8.0	Thereby, using fewer cars can help us live convinently and  handly.
8.0	To illustrate, when my mother and I went shopping, my mother always felt annoyed because that we could not find a parking place.
8.0	And we have no alternative to put our cars, can finding parking costed our much valubale time and energy.
8.0	So, people will use fewer cars due to convience.
7.0	To put all into a nutshell, I strongly believe that peole will use fewers cars in the future because
11.0	Have you ever been in a classroom and there is a teacher who made an incorrect point while teaching in front of everyone.
12.0	Last month, I face this situation.
11.0	There are three ways to deal with this situation.
9.0	Interrupt and correct the mistake right away, tell the person who is talking after the class or meeting is over, and say nothing to them.
9.0	For me, I chose the first one without a doubt.
4.0	Firstly, I think the speaker who makes public speaking have to make sure the information he/she serves is accurate.
8.0	Otherwise, the audience may be misleading.
8.0	In my situation, I found out a mistake that my teacher made.
8.0	I know the thing she said must be wrong.
8.0	And this incorrect point may not be realized by others in the classroom.
8.0	So I just called out and point out the mistake.
8.0	By doing this, the whole class will know this is wrong.
8.0	In another aspect, what if everyone can point out the incorrect point that teacher made.
8.0	In this way, the possibility of acquiring incorrect information could be dramatically decreased.
4.0	In addition, I think to call out and correct the mistake right away is a way to make the teacher or the meeting leaders less likely to make mistakes next time.
8.0	Consider this, during a meeting, the leader made a big mistake and no one reacts.
8.0	This mistake may happen again next time.
8.0	Even though some people might tell him/her after the meeting, the impression degree is different.
8.0	Pointing out by others is obviously more impressive.
8.0	So this mistake may be aware next time.
4.0	Admittedly, everyone will get shamed if someone points out an incorrect point he/she said in front of the public.
8.0	Most people do not want someone to say I'm wrong in front of the whole class or meeting.
8.0	However, I think if someone makes mistake.
8.0	They have to take the responsibility of that mistake he/she makes.
8.0	If no one says anything during the situation.
8.0	I think others in that situation may not know the teacher or team leader is wrong.
8.0	Even though someone tells them after that.
8.0	I think they won't mention this mistake in the future meeting or class.
2.0	All in all, I think to interrupt right away and correct that mistake is the best approach to solve this problem because it helps others aware that and it helps the teacher or meeting leader aware that.
11.0	Yes,I am agree with the following statement.
11.0	Firstly,I think everyones parents are caring about themselves.
11.0	They don not want you to make mistakes and pay for it.
11.0	So parents should let childern make mistakes and they can talk to their child not to do it after.
12.0	If shome one do something wrong but his or her parents do not punish them,maybe they would have a bad habit and also not good for the future.
5.0	Secondly,I think the child can learn something when he or she make a mistake.
8.0	If they can find someting themselves,they may realise they were wrong.
8.0	For me,when I was a child,I used to est food without clean my hand.
8.0	My parents mention to me many times but I did not pay attention on it.
8.0	One day,I did this as usually,something bad happended to me.
8.0	I felt uncomfortable with my stomach and my parents took me to a hospital and find I have a bad stomachache.
8.0	Fortunally,It is not that bad.
8.0	I should not do this,I thought after that day.
8.0	And I never did it after.
8.0	When we grow up,we can have some right judgment and do the right things.
8.0	We can learn from the  mistakes what we done.
5.0	Thirdly,This statement is also a way that parents teach their child.
8.0	They want their child to be a better man.
8.0	They want to give more to their child.
8.0	Children can gain more experience from mistakes and remember them.
8.0	It also can point their body to remember it.
8.0	These mistakes are full of happiness and sadness,it can let them grow up.
8.0	This way maybe better than that childern study from school.
8.0	They can find the problem themselves and not do it anymore.
0.0	If one day I have a child,I may teach him like it.
0.0	It is good for his or hers future and be a man who are responsible and honest.
0.0	Everyone make mistakes,It is important that you can realize it.
3.0	There are some viewpoints argues that if workers are more satisfied when they have many different types of tasks to do during the workday than when they do similar tasks all day long.
3.0	Some people suggest that doing the similar mission is beneficial for working efficiency, because when we finished the same thin, we would be familar with the tasks, we can finish the tasks without thinking too much time.
3.0	For example, students practice the same kind of problems can improve their rapid and tasks's score in a short time.
3.0	Conversely, as far as i am concerned, i really believe that taking different types of tasks to do can not only improve the efficiency of working but also promote the workers' passion of working and give them a better motion.
11.0	There are some reasons.
4.0	First of all, the latest researchs show that working at the same tasks in a long time must lead to the feeling of tired.
8.0	About more than eighty percent people of the survey indicate that they could not focus on the same thing more than three hours in one day.
8.0	In addition, an experiment comparing two kinds of people, one group were required to work at the same task without stop, another were admitted to have a rest or doing other work.
8.0	The finally result indicates that on the same long time the work effects of the latter group is better than the former.
8.0	We can draw the conclusion that doing the same task in long time cannot improve the working efficiency, on the contrary, workers are more suitable and willing to work in different types during the workday.
4.0	Moreover, works would feel unhappy and dissatisfied if they were required to work the same tasks all day long.
9.0	For example, in my laboratory, the same simple tasks always have different pesons to do so no one have the intention to finish the same thing to many times in a day.
9.0	That because we feel down if no fresh thing to do, also we do not have the feeling of achievement.
4.0	Last but not the least, doing different tasks can help people obtain the ability to resolve different problem.
9.0	Tht is very important to the confidence of the workers.
9.0	What's more, more confidence can promote workers working motivation and make workers satisfy their work and themselves.
2.0	To sum up, i think working in different tasks is better for workers.
3.0	Nowdays,people's life styles have changed because of the development of the transportation and technology.
3.0	People paid more attention to changing their lives into a more comfortable way.
3.0	While some people still have a job where you have to work five days for a short hoilday,other people are living a life which they can work just three days for long hours.
4.0	Well,if you have a chance to choose how you live,do you prefer to work in a short time and have a long vacation rather than work in a long time having a short vacation even without vacation?
4.0	Of course, we will choose the former.
10.0	The benefits of working only three days can be explained by analyzing how it can help us to relax ourselves and encourage affection with friends and families.
4.0	First of all,having a three-day job spare more time to relax ourselves.
8.0	As we know,most people are suffering great pressure from heavy work especially who live in big cities.
8.0	It is good chance for us to slow down our lives and find the beauty around us which we ignored in the past.
8.0	Not only can it benfit our health mentally and physically,but also can cultivate our interested that we spent no time on before.
0.0	What's more,we can spare more time to be with our families and friends.
0.0	For me,when I was a high school student,My parents were very busy with their work.
0.0	I still remembered I rarely had chance to talk with them that made me sad.
3.0	Nowadays, parents are looking forward to seeing their children's perfect acdemic performance by rewarding them in different method, one of which is money.
11.0	I do not think it is an appropriate way to induce student to make progress in their study life.
4.0	Initially, using money to illure students to study the class that they are not interested with only lead to the misleading that parent thinks the young boy or girl really like the major, and thinks that they should stick with the project through their study life.
9.0	As a result, the student who is captured by the money lose the oppotunity to find the subject  they really favor of.
9.0	What a pity it is to lose the interst in the subject you are work on, and the tragedy derives from the rewarding system making by the parents who reward their children's high mark with money.
4.0	What's more, the abnormal rewarding system can lead to students' desperate pursuit for marks instead of attatching importance on practice.
8.0	What practice is to theority, what water is to fish.
8.0	It can be harmful if student put too focus on mark rather than appliance.
8.0	For example, there was a time when my mom use the money to reward my high point test result.
8.0	I was hooked by the great mount of money, sinking all myself in studing the theory not going into the labouratory.
8.0	High point as I obtained, I find I did not learn anything useful.
4.0	Lastly, the money is not a suitble substance for rewarding children.
8.0	When the children develope the desire for the money too early in the life.
8.0	They will lose their innocent before other same-age friends.
8.0	Subsequently, it will let them feel a feeling of out of the peers.
8.0	Take my brother Tom as an example.
8.0	Tom has an very strong love for money since a very early age.
8.0	Though he is not much older than me, he represents an abnormal social trait.
8.0	It is the disgusting quality that makes him unpopular.
8.0	All the kids do not make friends with him.
0.0	Money rewarding system applying to the academic performance of a kid is definately an wrong choice.
0.0	We should be more wise when we chose the award to give the school-age child.
0.0	As long as we make the best choice, the children's best academic performances are around the corner.
3.0	Though some people think it is a good for parents to give their children money as the reward of getting a great score.
11.0	However , i do not agree on it.
11.0	It may creat more negative effect on teenagers than the positive effect.
5.0	First, offering the children money can make them put more attention on the scores of the exams instead of gaining useful knowledge or practical skills in the class.
8.0	Take one of my friends as an example, he works very hard to get a high mark in school to please his parents.
8.0	But, once his parents stopped to reward him with pocket money, he lost his interest in studying.
8.0	What is worse, his marks fell a lot since that.
5.0	What is more, such school-age children usually have little experience on how to deal with the money given by the adults.
9.0	Most of them may spend the money on buying junk food like candy or some comic books which both of them may to a negative result on their study.
9.0	Teenagers are too young to handle with not only the money but also such bad effects.
7.0	Last but not least, it is important to praise children after trying diligently to have a nice
3.0	As the passion of fans of celebrities is becoming more and more nowadays, a larger number of people are curious about the lives of celebrities they like.
12.0	Nevertheless, some opponents would argue that famous entertainers or athletes should obtain their own privacy.
11.0	From my perspective, I agree with this idea.
5.0	To begin with, sufficient privacy could be protective to celebrities and their families.
8.0	If the privacy of singers or a movie stars is exposed to the public too much, they may become more dangerous and easy to be hurt, because more people will know their accomodations and it is easy for those people who hate them due to the jealousy of reputation, high salary, or something else to find their locations and hurt them.
8.0	Although the fans of Justin Bieber, a well-known singer from Canada, are not likely to hurt him, some people who have learned about his some bad and negative history may hate him.
8.0	I read a news that when Justin was relatively young, he became famous and earned a high salary.
8.0	However, he was influenced by someone and used his money to have drugs, and although he admitted that thing and apologized to the public after he grew up, some people still could not forgive him and foud his house and destroyed it.
8.0	The exposure of Justin's house did a harmful impact on him.
5.0	Additionally, the lives of celebrities may be full of intervention without enough privacy.
8.0	Since fans can know about their daily schedules, there are always people following them whatever they do, and this influences their lives much.
8.0	Imagine that you are a famous singer and are ready to date with your lover, but this information has been exposed to your fans.
8.0	Ad a result, many people will come to the restaurant where you have dinner and you cannot have a tranquil environment with  your lover.
7.0	In conclusion, I would say that it is an disadvantageous idea of exposing the privacy of celebri
3.0	Nowadays, there is a heated topic: whether young people today have infuence on crital decisions which determine the whole society's future.
12.0	Answers vary from person to person.
11.0	Some people believes that the young affect the decisions which are essential to the future of society.
11.0	Contrary to their perspective comes my opinion that young people today do not influence the vital decisions making about the forward of societ.
5.0	Firstly, young people's decisions cannot be adopted by society.
8.0	It is acknowledged that the decisions determining the society's future are made by the government and companies.
8.0	It is because they have the authority to make compelling decisions which people would like to follow.
8.0	Besides, the professional knowledge and longer experience of dealing with serious issues makes them make correct desicions possible.
8.0	By contrast, most of young people are still attending schools, so they do not have enough work experience and social experience.
8.0	Their world values have not established, which means many of them can easily make wrong desions or be mislead by other people, thus the decisions made by young people always cannot be adopted by the society.
5.0	Secondly, few young people is willing to make decisions for the society.
10.0	To be specific, the young are busy in accomplishing their education, establishing friendships and dreaming their future career.
11.0	While many people may have the idea that it is a good way to relax oneself by waching a movie or reading a book, I find doing physical exercise can relax me better than doing the former two things.
5.0	As a college student, I have a big burden of studying, which means I have to read a lot of books and to watch a lot of teaching videos during my schooltime.
8.0	If I continue to do the samething for relaxation, I will fell it boring to watch and read again.
8.0	Besides, modern people spend more time sitting in desks inside the room and this is also needed for watching a movie or reading a book.
8.0	Lacking physical practices could bring some serious health problems,but it can be eliminated by going outside and do physical exercise instead of staying inside the house.
5.0	If we keep practice regularly, we can relax ourselves by sweeping in the field.
8.0	When I was in my last summer holiday, I started took yoga class everyday to kill time and relax myself.
8.0	After two month latter, I lost two kilograms in weight and have a better figure with more energetic.
8.0	Besides, Doing physical exercise can not only build your body, but also it can strenthen your sychology health.
8.0	I made a few friends in my yoga class and one of them become my best friend.
8.0	We often stay together to exchange the skills and opinions of yoga, and we organized a trip to do yoga at outdoors in different places including platus.
8.0	After one-year yoga exercise, I become more enthusiastic about my life and I can make myself fully concentrated on my academy project.
8.0	So physical exercise can bring one the inner peace and  relaxation both in body and mind.
1.0	However, doing physical exercise can be a tough job because it needs to be taken regularly.
1.0	But if you keep the habit of doing phsical exercise to relax yourself, you definitely will benefit from doing it.
12.0	People are keeping thinking that how can a man became a successful  man.
11.0	Tere are some people think a good ability to conmunicate well to others is more usaful than studying hard in school.
11.0	I do not agree with this idea.
11.0	Because a great knowledge of people's major can take a good begining of people's career and can also hlep a man do a  great job.
5.0	First, a great marks can make people find a satisfied job.
8.0	If people study hard in school, they will get good    marks at final exam.
8.0	And when they are looking for a job, the interviwee will judge their by the marks.
8.0	That means a great mark is usaful for people when they are looking for a job.
8.0	For instance, my brother was a very popular man in his school, but he never studied hard  in school.
5.0	Second, Two years ago, he made a friend with a company's chairman, and the chairman gave a good job to him.
8.0	We all felt happy for him.
8.0	But not long before, he losed his job because he often  did not know how to accomplish his task in company.
8.0	So studying hard is very important.
3.0	Celebtities, such as entertainers, actors and athlets' news have bnecome an important part of average people's daily life.
3.0	As the increasingly sufficient matirial condition, poeple have more leisure time to chat celebrities' gossip, spending considerable money on listening singer's concert, or just buy biographies of idols.
3.0	In this way, celebrities are far more exposed to the public than us common people, which arises a debate, whether famous people's provacy should be better protected?
11.0	As far as I am concerned, celebrities should have rights to have their own privacy, and deserve more privacy than now.
5.0	First, it is universally acknowledge that every citizen deserves privacy, especially in the information era.
8.0	No one would like their daily chat with friends and photos contain sensitive imformation being exposed to public.
8.0	In China, paparazzis often dog celebrities in order to acquire a signature or taking a photo with idol.
8.0	However some people across the line, they candid famous people and later upload photos to internet, which cause reputation loss for celebrities.
5.0	Further more, poeple should focus more on celebrities' achievements instead of their personal life.
9.0	For an entertainer, he or her job is to make good televplay and bring laughter to audiances; for athlets, they are dedecated to put all their strength in sports and gain award for their countries.
9.0	If people pay more attention to their privacy rather than their job, this may have bad effect on their performance, even influence their careers.
2.0	Admittedly, poeple regard celebrities as their life model, any mistakes they make may break beautiful illusion in people's mind.
7.0	However, it is important for people to realize, celebrities in some aspects are as normal as us, and we should give them their own space and do not
12.0	nowadays, it is a trendency to be high educated.
11.0	Because, in the future, it means a high salary job, a better living circumustance and a better life, which is cannot be realized under a poor education.
12.0	Thus, many parents are enger to let their chilren get good educate and get a good grades in school.
11.0	And parents want to reach that goal, they tried a lot of methods to inspire their children's study will.
10.0	Some of them offer thheir kids money if they get good grades in school.
11.0	And I agree with it in three parts.
5.0	First of all, giving them money will stimulate their study will, and they will study harder.
8.0	They will think that money is a present for their good grade.
8.0	For example, I used to be bored in studying in primary school.
8.0	And no matter how my parents told me the benefits of study, it did not work.
8.0	Nevertheless, one day, may father told me that if I got 10 point improve in my next math exam, he would give me 10 yuan.
8.0	It could buy a lot of snacks in 10 yuan.
8.0	And as 10 yuan for my goal.
8.0	A month later, I got 11 point improve.
8.0	So I think give money is a great way to stimulate children to study.
5.0	Second, it will train children to have a financial thinking.
8.0	Financial thinking is an essential ability when they grow up.
8.0	I can vividly remember that my father told me that when he was young, he would get reward by helping parents doing housework.
8.0	And because of these rewards, he got a chance to manage his assets.
8.0	He also appreciated that because of the experience of manage money when he was young.
8.0	Now, he can earn and save money for this family.
10.0	Third,
12.0	I THINK IT'S A BAD IDAE .
6.0	ABOVE ALL THE KIDS IS TOO YOUNG TO CONTORL THEMSELVES .
8.0	THEREFORE,IF MANY STUDENTS WILL BE ANGERY ,THEY WOULD BE VERY MISSED ,IT'S UNHEATHY FOR CHILREN TO GROW UP.
8.0	IN THE RECENT YEARS ,MORE AND MORE KIDS ARE BE TROUBLEIN THIS WAY.
8.0	IN ORODER TO AVOIDE THIS WAY HAPPENED AGAIN ,PARENTS MUST BE REALIZE THIS PROBLEM.
8.0	AS A CHILD WE SHOUBE BE RELIZE THIS SERIOUSLY .
8.0	AS A MATT ER OF FACT ,WE NEED TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.
7.0	LET'S GET TOGETHER
3.0	Nowadays, many people thinks that it is teachers but not friends that influence students more.
11.0	There ae many reasons why they think so: Teachers are more professional and know more then those kids.
12.0	And also teachers impart students knowledge and other skills and students will have gratitude to them, which they may not have to their friends.
12.0	However, in my opinion, friends affect students more.
4.0	First, it is possible that children dislike teachers and do not listen to them or follow them.
8.0	The young are always longing for freedom and liberty.
8.0	But it is true that teachers often make rules for them to obey and ask them to do what they are unwilling to do.
8.0	It is children's instinct to play, but teachers always let them seat quietly and take notes of the lessons.
8.0	Kids like watch films, however, remembering the poets and literatures is what the teachers let them do.
8.0	If the youths dnot listen to teachers, how can they be influence?
4.0	In addition, students have more time contacting with friends.
8.0	For example, I can ride to school, have classes, have meals, and go back nome with friends.
8.0	I surprisedly find that my friends are always with me.
8.0	Even before sleeping I will chat with them on QQ.
8.0	And they really affect my daily life.
4.0	Furthermore, people of similar ages may have more things in commom.
10.0	People are more likely to cha
1.0	In conclusion, although teachers can influence students, friends affects them more.
1.0	Thus, spend more time with a good friend can make you better.
3.0	People always work hard to earn money to support their family .
12.0	If we don't have a job , we will not make a living in the society .
3.0	With the development of the world , people become busier and busier on their work , and they have to concentrate more on it .
12.0	And there is a discussion that worker are more satisfied when they have many different types of tasks to do during the workday than when they do similai tasks all day long.
12.0	In my opinion , I am in favor of the point that workers are more willing to do similar work during the workday.
6.0	Pay more attention to the same thing is more effective .
9.0	If workers do one thing all day , they will have enormous time to consider how to accomplish the work quikly , and when they have finished it , in the same time , they have enough time to check wheather there are error they have ignored before  .
9.0	For example ,
12.0	Some people think offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get it school is not idea, but I have another thinking, i have another ways to give you:good school have good teacher and other is their school has good education with the student., so this is my thinking.
4.0	Some parents think the school get the high grade is mistake, but i think this ways is good too, because some poor familary  doesn't have any money,so they can't accept some school get the high grade, i can feel it, For example some good students if they want go to good school they need much money ,but if their family doesn't have much money ,they can't go to this school, so some parents think some schoool get high grade get it in school is mistake.
10.0	However i have another ways can evident instead things.
4.0	First, some school get the high grade I think is great, because some good school have good teachers, their may is famers teacher, so the school have high grade.
9.0	For instance, if some famers mathematician in this school teach to student, then the school must to get the high grade in school.
9.0	so some school must high the grade.
4.0	Second, some school have high grade and must have some cause, like their school has good education with the student.
10.0	To illustrat, if give some bad students to this school, but this school doesn't have good teacher to teach the students, and after 2years ago, this students have good performance, than we know this school have good education to teach this student, so their school have high grade.
2.0	Finally, in this passage i have 2 ways give you, first is good school have good teacher to teach the student, and the other is some school have good educate with the student, so this is my reasons.
12.0	I agress with the point that relaxing by watching a movie or reading a book is better than by doing physical exercise.
11.0	And I will give two reason in the following text.
5.0	First, I suggests that watching a movie or reading a book can boarden our eyesight and lead a happier life.
8.0	As we all know, students now are living under a heavier stress than before, not only in study but also in life.
8.0	Most of them can only consider what is beneficial for thier workship.
8.0	They gave up developing their interest and their personal quaitilies, which also play an important role in thier life.
8.0	And watching a movie or reading a book for relax can help them!
8.0	Watching <Superman> can arise your heroship and think the relationship between blame and abilities.
8.0	Reading <Olds and Sea> can let you konw what is real tough man.
8.0	That's what nowadays students lack!
5.0	Secondly, going for a movie or reading can let us make more friends.
8.0	Just as my roommate Wang.
8.0	When we frist arrived at the university, we did not know a person.
8.0	Wang is a out-going person, and he often ask others going for a movie.
8.0	Thus he has made many friends, including his girlfriend which surprised me and my other roommates.
8.0	By doing these activities, we can learn how to get along with whom we acounter first.
8.0	Besides, we can find those people who have the same interest with us.
2.0	In summary, I suppose that it is better to relax bt watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise for these two reasons, personal development and making friends.
3.0	As parents, they do have right to admire their children after they have a high grade in school with money.
3.0	Offer money not the only way to admire, but it is the most effective one.
3.0	When I was a  school-age child, I always enjoy the money which parents offered me.
3.0	Beacuse it seem like I was working for my parents.
3.0	The simple empolement between my parents and me, is a reflect of this society: hard work will bring wealth.
12.0	And offer money for my hard-working is also an acception from my parents.
5.0	To instead, if parents didn't offer money after their children have a high grades, just make a encouragable comment on it, children do gain a great valume.
9.0	"However, they would more confused in their school-age, ""what's my propose, why I was studing when my friends were playing video games""."
9.0	This unfair emotion could ruin thier long term life stratage.
5.0	In the other hands, though offered children with money sounds a great idea, it do have some specific work to encourage their children.
8.0	Their chilren would found the meaning for studing.
8.0	For instant, their parents made a deal with children,the more grade they get in the exam, they will offer children more money.
8.0	Compare with no pay for children, money would be their motivate to hard-work.
1.0	In addition, offer money would also created a better relationship between parents and children.
1.0	In many families, children are not easy to control, expecially in the school-age.
7.0	They will do many harmful
11.0	Currently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people: what is the better ability about making friend for people's happiness.
11.0	Some claims that the ability to make new friends easily is more important.
11.0	However, contrary to their view comes my perspective that it is the ability to maintain good relationship with a small group that influence people more.
12.0	My point is well elaborated as follows.
5.0	To begin with, only when people devote their whole heart to others can they obtain a long-term friendship, which plays an important role in people's mood.
8.0	To be specific, in oder to make better friends, people need to show thier good faith to others and run out of their energy, which means offering help when others in emergency, share happiness when others feel sad and encouraging each other when faced with difficulty.
8.0	Under such efforts, even though it needs more time and sacrafice opportunity to make new friends, people might establish stable friendship with real friends and these friends can also help us in need and make people feel happy.
8.0	On the contrary, if people just busy in knowing new friends' name and hobbies instead of learning about them deeply, how could these people have real friends?
5.0	In addition, the most important thing to make people happy about friends is not the number of friends making but rather what is the quality of the friends.
8.0	To elaborated, it is not doubt that a people with good qulity can make it easier for other people feel at ease.
8.0	As we all know, with good quailty, such as honesty, integraty and genuenie, people might be kind to the person around them and less likely to make conflit.
8.0	However, such people still need time and energy to find so those who make a lot of friends usually have no patient to cultvate their relationship with better people.
7.0	In conclusion, it is better for people to maintian fren
12.0	As far as we all know, if one person wants to success, he or she will needs to have the social net work and studying hard at high school and get into a better univerisity.
11.0	As for myself, i think the studying hard in school is more important, because only by study hard will you have the opporunity to get a better job.
4.0	Firstly, studying hard can give us the chance to have the experience that we will use in our job.
8.0	For example, my teacher used to be a math teacher, he taught me how to study the math and get a better grade in math.
8.0	I asked him why he can teach so interesting and not make me feel bored, he told me when he at high school he favorite subject was math, he always get the best grade in class, so when he got into univerisity, he chose the math as he major and get his own special experiwnce in study math.
8.0	That's the reaon why he can get the teache's job and teach me how to study math.
4.0	Second,learing well is a good way to get close to the best person in what major they are studying.
8.0	Thy can talk with the professor in their major and team up with the other people in this major.
8.0	So when get a job in the future,if he or she faced with some prolems, they can asked their professor or partners they used to be work together to address the problems.
8.0	This is the other reason why i beliene that studying hard is more important than the ability to relate to people.
4.0	Third, even though the ability to relate to people will give the better chance to get the job, but you can't do well in you job, you still will get fire by you boss.
9.0	As we all know, if you want to develop in your job and get the chance to get a higher salary, only by studying hard can you get the salary.
9.0	Moreover, if you can't do well in your job, your colluage will not talk to you and even though you try your best to relate to them, they still will leave you,because you don't have the ability to let them totrust your work ability and work with you.
0.0	Above what has been discussed, it's not hard to find that studing hard is more important to relate to people.
0.0	Not only studying hard give the better chance to get the job but also can help you relate to the professionals in your major.
0.0	From hard studying  in school you still can get the experience maybe you will use in your future job which will give you a better salary and the enjoyable of the mental.
11.0	i agree with the it.
11.0	Inmorden society,there are many people who wouldn't give a hand to the strangers who is struggling.
11.0	Maybe someone will say.
11.0	people are becoming more and more cool to a man who they are not familiar with.
11.0	But  in my opinion,people are more prone tohelp others,My arguments for this point are listed as follows.
4.0	First,currently people are more wealthy so they can help strangers easily.
8.0	In the past,many people can just feed themselves by thier salary because the economy war in a worse condition than nowadays.
8.0	If they help others,maybe it will add to their own burden,they can not help others even if they would liketo do that.
8.0	But now,more and more people can afford a car,they can make more money and even save some money for entertament,it is not difficult for they to help strangers.
4.0	Besides,they can get return from the people who they used to help.
8.0	There are more examples that a man was helped when he was in trouble,and when he solve it and finally success,he gives a great money as a return to the people who used to help him.
8.0	I have a classmate named Lily,when her father was just a worker,he used to help a man who just lose all his money because his fail in his investment,her father tried to give him some aid on his money and bring him to have a good meal,and when the man finally attained success,he bought a car for her family and helped his father get promoted.
8.0	Sometimes it is also an investment to help others.
4.0	Addition,people with a good education now are more warm hearted.
9.0	With the development of the education,peolple become good manners and they are likely to help the man in trouble.
9.0	When i was a little boy,my teather told me to help each others,and if effects through all my life,now I also give a hand to the people whoever need help,so I can believe nowadays people are fond of help struggling stangers,beacuse they are worth helping.
2.0	All in all,I think with the development of economy and the promote of education,people are more likely to help someone who is struggling even if then dont know about them.
3.0	Education is always a hot and important topic because everyone's growth is accompanied with education.
12.0	When it comes to how to educate children, some people will say parents should edify their children for everything and put the way for children.
11.0	However, from my perspective I think parents should let children learn from their own mistakes.
12.0	In this way, children can have a long time impression and they will know they have some defects so that keeping a honest attitude.
5.0	First of all, learning from their own mistakes can make a deep impression in children's lives so that they will avoid making the same mistakes forever.
8.0	If children improve themselves in this way, the experience of correcting the mistakes will have a profound effect.
8.0	For example, when I was a kid, I used to lick my fingers if I have nothing to do.
8.0	Then I was ill when I take an important examination.
8.0	I was diagnosed with chronic enteritis.
8.0	There were so many bacteria in my stomach because of my bad habit.
8.0	From then on, I never licked my fingers.
8.0	I think it is an important role for my healthy body.
8.0	I learn from my own mistake so that I can remember it in my whole life.
5.0	Besides, the children can keep a honest attitude if they know they are not prefect.
8.0	Everyone can make mistake, even the saint.
8.0	Like one of my roommates is very honest, He always note the mistake problems in a notebook and check himself everyday.
8.0	He is a very good student and friend with everyone.
1.0	Addimittedly, teaching their children directly form their examples can work, too.
1.0	I think learn from themselves can be more efficient.
3.0	With the quickly development of education, parents need to speed more attention on their children's education.
11.0	I believe  that offer the prizes to the children who get high marks in school is a good way to make children get higher marks.
5.0	Firstly, parents give money to their children can make them get more passion in study.
8.0	When parents give their children prizes so that after children first time get the prizes they will work harder next time because they want to get the przes again.
8.0	For example, Amy does not like either study or review a test because she think that she has no passion on the test because she does not realize the importance of a test and the benifits from a test.
8.0	However, everything change after her parents decide give her 20 dollars of money for each test if she could get the marks higher than 86; Amy suddenly get the passion to tests and everytime must review a test.
8.0	In this example, Amy's situation is appeared in many other children, children need passion to do a thing instead of just the results, Futhermore, give the money to children can make them more careful to the test.
8.0	Usually, the children know how to do most of the questions, they just always very careless.
8.0	For instance, I used to be a pretty careless child and I was not only careless in lifetime, but also in test time.
8.0	My mom came up with a idea that  can let me aviod these careless in the test time and that was giving the extra money to become a prize so that I will own a goal for getting high mark.
8.0	While, I really got high marks in tests after mom gave me this prize.
8.0	In my opinion, children need an extra thing to check themselves so that they can pay more attention on it.
5.0	Finally.
8.0	parents give children money can improve their relationships.
8.0	In nowadays a lot of parents have a bad relationship with their children.
8.0	In fact, my best friend Jacky got a bad relationship with his parents because they did not have too much communication opportunities.
8.0	If his parents can give him prizes, they will probably get more communication between each other.
8.0	Actually, in children's hearts they are expecting have more communication with their parents.
8.0	They want to parents become their friends instead only parents.
2.0	In conclusion, parents could offer more passion and less careless to students if they give the prize to them .
3.0	Issues ralated to studying have never failed to attract people's attention.
12.0	When it comes to taking courses, recently a hotly debated topic has arouse among the public: whether students should take history courses even they are not major in it.
11.0	Some may indicates that every students need to know the history and take the courses.
12.0	However, as far as I am concerned, I trongly agree with that not every students should take the history class.
11.0	My point of views will be illustrated as follow.
5.0	First of all, students whose major is totally different from history need more time to focus on their own major.
8.0	To be specific, history, a kind of lierature courses as we all know, needs people spend a lot of time memorying, which means that if students want to learn it well or get a good grades, much time will be occupied.
8.0	However, some other kinds of subject such as physics or chemistry which nearly have no connection with history also need much time to trailing and exploiting.
8.0	To a great extent, such kind of experimental disciplings require more time from students.
8.0	For instance, I am major in chemistry.
8.0	One of my classmates chose history as elective course last term.
8.0	However, the period of our important experiment is also the time of history course final, which the both part need him to take great efforts on time.
8.0	As a result, he did either do well in the experiment nor the history exam.
8.0	Consequently, if students' field is not relative to history, they do not have to take history courses.
5.0	On top of that, it is useless to take the course for those students who are not interested in history.
9.0	In details, if the students are not interested in history, even they go to the class they will not concentrate on the teacher, which is a waste of time for them.
9.0	Additionally, it is better for they need to use these time to take some courses they like or do some entertainment.
2.0	All in all, juding from all above, I strongly insist that not all university students have to take history courses even they are not major in it.
3.0	It is common for most of students to spend the majority of their life time with their  teachers and friends.
3.0	especially when their enter the school.
3.0	School or campus life provides the students and students with  a great opportunity to know each other.
12.0	Though friends do take  very important roles in students' life, I still hold the opinion that students can be more influenced by their teachers than by their friends.
5.0	on one hand, students get their academic knowledge from their teachers who are mostly selected by the government with higher authority, which means that most teachers have not only professional knowledge but also reliable on moral aspect.
10.0	students can learn a lot from them, even when the students meet some trouble, most teachers would also like to help them, most importantly, the teachers are usually older in tha age, so they can help the students in more useful way.
5.0	on the other hand, teachers, especially teachers for younger students living in boarding schools who go back home only a few times, they would be more pacience and are able to provide help for students' living ability.
8.0	In outher words, those teachers even play the role of the students' parents.
8.0	therefore, it is really easy for the students to be influenced by the teachers.
8.0	Finally, most students spend at least 20 years in school.
8.0	it is really a long time for the teachers and students to get along with.
8.0	I believe that the period in the school would be unforgetable for most students.
1.0	As I said before, friends are important for most people, but many people spend most of their life without friends, and they still live a normal life.
1.0	someoen even can achieve greatness in some area, because they do not need to spend their time with their friends and have more time to learn, so I  believe that students are more inflenced by their teachers.
11.0	I certainly agree with the statement that the people in this age are more likely to help the strangers who need help.
5.0	Firstly, people have more ways to help the strangers easily through the techonology.
8.0	For example,  Tencent, one of the biggest internet company in China, established a big internet platform which called Tencent public warefare.
8.0	This plateform is aim to help the people who need help from the whole country.
8.0	And the website of the Tencent public warefare is really popular, people know those poor people's stories from the websit and to donate the money for those people who need.
8.0	And it is said this website can rais almost 2,000,000 in one day, and those money will be sended to those people by the organization.
5.0	Secondly, people live a better life, more and more people have enough time, enough money to help others.
8.0	Contribute to the developement of economic and techonology, more people do not need to worry about food, clothing.
8.0	They can pay more attention on the spirit life.
8.0	And helping others can be one part of it, bring the happiness to others also can make ourself satisfied.
10.0	Over all
12.0	Recently, a controversial topic has raised a heated debate: whether an ambitious dream is better for people.
11.0	Some people claim that people with ambitious dreams are more likely to gain great achivement.
11.0	However, from my perspective, people will benefit more when they focus on realistic goals.
12.0	My reasons and examples are given below to illustrate my standpoint.
5.0	First and foremost, people can eaily set daily tasks, which will help them be closer to their goals step by step and achieve their goals in the end.
8.0	For realsitic goals, every step to the goal can be predicted, so people can make plans at the beginning to decide what they should do at first and what to do next.
8.0	But the ambitious dreams are always too far from the reality that people even do not know how to make their first step.
8.0	So the dreams remain the dreams even many years later juat because it is unrealistic to be closer to them.
8.0	For example, one of my classmates in high school always dreamed of earning one billion dollars in the future without thinking of how to achieve it.
8.0	Then he found studying in school cannot help him earn money, so he just applied himself to computer games, through which he did not need to think that he cannot achieve his dream.
8.0	But then the teachers talked to him that he can set simple goals such as going to a good university or finding a good job first.
8.0	And from then on, he began to work hard to be closer to his favorite university gradually.
5.0	Furthermore, because realistic goals are easier to achieve, people can gain confidence and happiness from them.
10.0	People who always set realistic goals for themselves are more likely to feel satisfication from simple achivements like getting good grades in an an exam or learning a new skill.
7.0	But people with ambitious dreams will think although they have achieved a lot, they are still far away from their dreams, so they gain simple happiness from
11.0	I think it is better to relax by doing physical exercise than relax by watching a movie or reading.
12.0	Frist, when we feel tired, we want to relax our brains more, watching a movie or reading may make us more tired.
11.0	Second, doing physical exercise can improve our spirit and get more vividfy, we could be physical even though it is tired when doing that.
11.0	Third, doing physical exercise is interesting and we can do that with our friends, we can not only do exercise but can talk during that.
6.0	When I was fifteen years old, tired with study and relaxed by reading.
8.0	But my friend called me playing pingpang.
8.0	We played very happy that day and I never felt so excited before.
8.0	When we got a rest during playing, we talked about some interesting things, that made us laughing.
8.0	After that, I felt enery to do my study.
2.0	So I think it is better to relax by doing physical exercise.
3.0	Every one have different feeling form the happniess when they work.
12.0	But Iam argue with this statement beacause I think the workers would do more statisfaction work when they doing different types of takes while others.
12.0	Do the same types can let people more focus on the one question  If peopele just constanly do the one thing and coninution impovement that thing were let pople felt happy because Focus on one thing is more fulfilling.
12.0	Everyone is good at different things .
12.0	If constanly try something different there is frustration to sick to things these are often depends on the rational,is need to pay hard and lot of peopel are hard to do, is to do after can bring many benefits is delay to meet.
6.0	I used to practice vocal music every day .
8.0	when I saw a little increasein  my vocal music level., Ifelt vert fulfilled and satisfield  Presistence shows that you are already on the road to success.
8.0	the concepr of persistence always reminds peoplr of many heros.
8.0	when we constanly to do one thing we will feel the satisfiled and feel proud of walking with heroes
3.0	Finding jobs is always a hotly debated topic.
3.0	People are all considering about many factors of job, like salary, holiday, and security.
12.0	Some insist that they just want a secure job to assure that they can have a healthier body and blissful life.
11.0	Others reckon that they would like to find a more satisfying job so that they can not only have a relaxing life, but a better quality of life.
12.0	I agree the latter standpoint.
11.0	I think a more fulfilling job is beneficial to people.
6.0	First of all, a job contented can make person have a better mental health.
8.0	For example, My uncle is an office worker who is always sit in the chair and just writing the article from 8:00 am. to 10:00 pm.
8.0	His job may be the most secure job.
8.0	So it's difficult for him to have a spare time to release himself, which leads him to get a mental sickness.
8.0	However, my mom is a saler who sale the child's courses.
8.0	It's not a secure job for her.
8.0	Because some parents have a bad temper that may have a quarrel with may mom even beat my mom.
8.0	But most of time, my mom always chat with many children so she has a young heart and a good temper.
8.0	She is contented with her job.
8.0	Hence, the secure job can not assure people's mental health.
1.0	Second, a satisfying job can guarantee people's quality of life.
1.0	For example, my classmates' dad is a engineer who  All in all, a satisfying job haves more advantages than secure job.
3.0	Our country become more and more powerful, and our economy  increasing very fast, so there are have some things will change in the future.
12.0	Such as our transportation, transportation is very important in our life.
12.0	Some people think that the car will increase in the future, because people become rich and rich, they have ability to buy more and expensive cars, but some people claim that the car will decrease in the future, because the techonology graduately stronger than before.
11.0	Personally, I believe that the car will less than today, because the techonology will be more advanced.
5.0	Firtly, a majority of people advocate the green travel, so less and less car will appear in the future.
9.0	For example, at the begin many people will drive their car to go outside, but in the furture, the time is change, many people advocate we need to take the bus and subway to reduce environmental pollution, because it is good for our mental and physical health.
9.0	People will start this health way go outside, so the car will decreased.
5.0	secondly, our country become more and more powerful, so the techonoloy also become very advanced than before.
8.0	It is opportunity for us to change our life, when techonology become more advanced, it will have more high level transportantion let us use.
8.0	we can no londer just take the car to arrival what place we want to go.
8.0	Maybe we can take the airway to go to school or other place in the future.
10.0	Finally,  the car will de
3.0	"""Hey, do you have a free-style?"" which almost becomes a greeting sentence among most young people in China, for this came out from a very cool and popular singer star."
3.0	Meanwhile, Chairman Mao's name can be heard very frequently among elderly people, the reason which even does not need to explain, can be clearly seen that Mao's exploits about the construction of New China had a deeply impact on our Chinese people, especially the elders.
3.0	Therefore, i do not agree with the opoinin mentioned in the Qestion.
12.0	As far as i am conerned, only if the celebrites have positive energy, they are able to play a significant role in both the yougers and the elders.
4.0	First and foremost, celebrities can be compared as a summer's day, positive energy, just like the indispensible sunshine can be found on them.
10.0	Through them, every person, not just the children or the old people, can cultivate a well behaviour, or learn something useful from them.
4.0	Secondly, celebrities are the deep srpings of dreams.
8.0	For instance, Deng Yaping, the famous Chinses Ping-pong player who doesn't have much talents, but in the end, after endless practices, she was the Champion of that generation.
8.0	It is the reason why there are so many people like her, both the young people and the elder people.
8.0	For the reason of Deng Yaping, they know the meaning of sticking on one thing, then their dreams may be come true.
8.0	After all, where there is a will, there is a way.
4.0	Last but not least, there will be common interest among both young and elder people if the celebrities they like are the same.
10.0	Through this common issue, the commuicational gap between these two generations may disappear.
2.0	In conclusion, Celebrities play a key role in both young and elder people.
3.0	Nowadays, people pay more attention to the teaching methods or ways .
3.0	Students can get mor eknowledges and form their personality in their schools.
3.0	An interesting disscussion has arisen among people: whether the strdents are influenced  more by their teacher or by their friends?
3.0	As far as I am concerned, I completely support the ideal that the teachers caused more effects to their students.
12.0	This is not only because that the teachers will broad the student's horizons, but also because that the teachers can teaches them more kowledges than the friends.
5.0	Teachers can broad the students horizons.
8.0	In that way, the teachers can teach the students to have onther perspectives when thinking about the things, the students will think for things in a different kind of view, which will benefit them in their lifelong journey.
8.0	Also, since the teachers are more experied than the students, they can tell them about some situations tey have never seen before, so their students can be calm and self confident when they meet the same situation.
8.0	Take my friend Take as an example.
8.0	When he was in primary school, his English teacher has already been to America for years, so his teacher told him a lot of things about American culture.
8.0	When he go abroad to USA recently, he told me that he can easily get used to the American life, and he makes a lot of friends with foreign people, this is all due to his ehlish teacher has already told him about lifes and syles in America.
5.0	Teacher can teach the students more knowleges than the same ages.
8.0	Since many teachers may graduate form a university, yhey get a better diploma tham their students, therefore, they may know more knoleges than teirs students, so their students can learn something form them.
8.0	However as for friends, they are almost in same age, so they can't do such things.
8.0	Take me as an example.
8.0	As a high school student, the teachers really teachs me a lot of things about some basic knowledge and skills, as the history, the art and so on.
8.0	However, my friends can't teach me such things, so the teachers makes more influences on me.
7.0	To put it into a nutshell,  students are more influenced by their teachers rater than their f
3.0	When it comes to the task concerning cooperation, I surely attend that working collaborately is much more conducive to students' projects.
3.0	Teaming with others enables us to learn something available from partners and exposes us to more demanding and challenging jobs,  which indisputably contributes to our enhancement.
3.0	Working with others also stimulates us to develop original and novel thinking.
12.0	However, it's arduous for us to achive our accomplishment if we work alone.
5.0	In the first place, woking with others provides us a golden opportunity to exchange ideas and messages with teammates.
8.0	The way how people analyse and deal with an issue varies  from person to person.
8.0	Each approach repersents one way to tackle one prblem.
8.0	Analysis and comparison will be valuable when all kinds of approaches mixed,  people can absorb new thinking way from others and shape dissimilar solutions, which helps the comprehensive and creative development of the project.
5.0	Second, people have the tendency to strive for more demanding and risky projects if they possess  abundant energy.
8.0	Everyone in the group will commit himself or herself to the project, considering it tremendously holy.
8.0	Nothing is impossible when everyone utlizes whatever he can to promote the development of the project.
8.0	Everyone works together to render it more specific, practical and complete once an idea comes out.
7.0	From what has been discussed above, I assert the belief that co
11.0	Parents like their child to be successful in school.
11.0	They know that doing well in school can have many future benifits for the child.
12.0	That's why they give their chidren financial award when they get good grades to spark their passion for studying.
4.0	However,from my perspective,giving money as an award is not so good.
8.0	It may have some short-term results,but ies destructive effects on the child's life are enormous.
8.0	First and foremost ,giving money as  an reward probably make kids mamminish.
8.0	Money is just a kind of reward of hard work or good grade.
8.0	Knowledge and other things you could get from school are actually more significant.
8.0	Many students of mine now are showing off their clothes,sneaker,bagsand so on but pay little attention to study.
8.0	This may be the result of giving money to child.
4.0	Secondly,a soon reward after getting a high score may make children relaxed.
9.0	Every time I get a good grade ,I want to relax myself such as playing computer games or others.
9.0	Giving money may lead to a more serious consequence.
4.0	Instead of giving money ,taking your children to travel or giving them reward like books are better choices.
10.0	Not only can they relax themselves in a healthier way ,but also be aware of the ahcievement og high score.
2.0	By and large ,giving money to a child for high grades have many negetive consequences on his life.
12.0	I agree with the statement mentioned in the question.
4.0	Someone may argue that doing physical exercise appears much better for our health than watching a movie or reading a book.
8.0	This is indeed the case.
8.0	However,the key word in the statement is 'relax',not 'fit'.
8.0	In regard to 'relax',I will reason the topic in two aspects.
4.0	The first aspect of 'relax' is to relax our body.
9.0	Obviously,watching a movie or reading a book while seated in an armchair beats perfectly doing physical exercise while straining our muscles and being exhausted.
9.0	The former hits the goal of relaxing,whereas the latter rushes to the contrary.
4.0	The second aspect,and the more abstrat one,is to relax our mind.
8.0	In this realm the former also wins the competition.
8.0	By watching a movie or reading a book,we delve into a wonderful world of stories where we hand our mind completely out to the author,and need not think harshly on ourselves (we could not have books of hieroglyphs or difficult maths descriptions to relax!).
8.0	The former method will have our sight and mind led by the ongoing process of the story without losing too much of  our brain cells.
8.0	Doing physical exercise,however,drags us into a challenge.
8.0	Even if we avoid fierce,competitive sports which George Orwell once stated as 'provoking hatred',we are faced with the battle of our mind and our sore muscles in jogging,consistent requirement of willpower in yoga,etc..
8.0	In that case,the former also performs much better in relaxing our mind than the latter.
2.0	In summary,watching a movie or reading a book is indeed a better choice instead of doing physical exercise when it comes to the key word 'relax',and in both flesh and spirit aspects I agree with the statement.
3.0	What is you impression toward university professors?
3.0	"nowadays, when we mentioned professor, the first word in our mind is "" rich""."
11.0	As a matter of fact, most of the professors nowadays own their private corportion, and they gain most of their money from their business.
12.0	so, there is no need to improve the professor's salaries.
5.0	To begin with, more money should be spended on improving equipments of the university.
8.0	In fact, the more fund are spend on epuipments, the high quality the education would be.
8.0	For instance, if universities spend a weath of money on renew the study facility on the chemical lab, all the chemistry major students chould get benefit from it.
8.0	For the students, they have more access to do the experiment, so they will get more accurent data from the new facility.
8.0	Then, the quality of education are improved.
5.0	On the top of that, as I have said, improving the salaries for professors is helpless for profeesor's income.
9.0	In order to improve the quility of education, collage should put more attention on the access of the lab.
9.0	In fact,
3.0	With the rising of people's living standard, people will pay more attention on other respects such as education.
12.0	And there are many approaches to improve the quality of educaion, so take university professors' salaries into consideration, a lot of individuals have an assertion that a favourable avenue to enhance the standard of education is to spend more money on salaries for university profeeeors becasue it can enable professors to be occupied with teaching and improving their teaching skills.
11.0	However, I strongly disagree with the statement, and my reasons and exmaples are as follows.
5.0	First of all, there are various methods to raise the standard of education, such like upgrade diverse advanced facilities.
8.0	Faced with the development of teachnique rapidly, the universities are supposed to update some Mul-ti media equippments and applicance.
8.0	For instace,I can clearly remember that ten years ago, there were no up-to-date facilities in my primary school.
8.0	So during the class, my English teacher had to write every important details on the blackboard in order to make sure that the whole class can understand the knowledge.
8.0	And there is no doubt that the method was extrememly time-wasting and also made low efficiency.
8.0	Finally, in the end of the sememter, a number of students in our class could not get ideal grades due to the outdate facilities, though my teachers had tried her best to teach us.
8.0	However, the school upgraded many advaced facilities these years, and it is convenient for teachers to teach.
8.0	Therefore, the quality of education was improved exceedingly.
5.0	Admittedly, it is true that is the university proferssor gain more salaries in eaching career, they will spend more time and energy on teaching.
8.0	Undoubtedly, their teahcing skills will be improved, so the students can learn more information and gain more important knowlege from the teachers.
8.0	What is more, the teachers will have a positive mood due to the rise of their salaries, so they will convey the happy and ethumisiatic to whole class, which will improve the efficency of teaching and learning.
8.0	However, many people can keep a balance between wokring and chaing more money.
8.0	Thereby, it is really dangerous that these university professor pay more concentrate on pusuing money instead of teaching.
1.0	To put all into a nutshel, from my perspecitve, I certainly refute the explaination that the university should spend more money on salaries for university professors.
1.0	For two reasons, there are more various ways to improve education quality and the professors will be disturbed by moeny
12.0	Many people would say that they have the ability to become friends with a person who they even just met, and that make them really happy.
12.0	After all, make a lot new friends can make someone's life more abandence.
11.0	However, from my point of view, I am more likely to have the ability to connect with several old friends.
4.0	In the first place, I have to say that making many new friends can make you know a lot knowledge in many different areas that told by these friends.
8.0	However, in my opinion, these knowledge do not always good for people.
8.0	If you meet a guy who usually steal others' things, and he usually tells you the skills in stealing and how he can become rich easily.
8.0	You can truly wide your version, but can you promise you will never think about using these skills to stole other people?
4.0	In addition, the small number of people know you better.
8.0	When you connect with them ,they will make you feel comfortable and feel like home.
8.0	Take myself for example, last time when I finished my final exam, I dicided to hang out with Lily, who has been my friend for thirteen years.
8.0	But because the teachers have to talk to us after the exam, I got late.
8.0	When I got to the restaurant that we dicided to meet each other, she had already ordered my favorate food, and Iwas hungry because of the whole day long exam!
8.0	And if I went out with some new friends, they may not concern about me, which can make me feel a little unhappy.
4.0	What is the most important that these old friends are reliable.
8.0	For instance, once I was buying some pens which I needed in a store, I do not bought enough money.
8.0	And there I met some new friends, I tried to ask them for help, but they just said sorry because they do not have much money and they may need to use them.
8.0	Finally, I have to call Alice, who is also one of my best friends and is not far from me, ask for her help.
8.0	When she heard my problem, she hurried to the store, and lend the money that she would use for her lunch.
10.0	On the basis of the
12.0	AS FAR AS I CAN SEE,PARENTS OFFERING THEIR SCHOOL-AGE CHILDEN MONEY TO MOTIVATE THEM TO LEARN IS A VERY COMMON THING.
12.0	I, HOWEVER, DON'T AGREE WITH THEM.
12.0	IN MY OWN EXPERIENCE,MY PARENTS ONCE REWARDED ME FOR MY GOOD PERFORMANCE IN AN EXAM.
3.0	TELLING THE TRUTH,I WERE REALLY INSPIRED BY THIS ACT.
8.0	AFTER ALL, CHILDEN ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE TEMPTED.
8.0	I USUALLY USE THIS MONEY TO BUT SOME CANDIES, CHOCOLATES, SPICY STRIP AND SO ON.
8.0	HOWEVER, AS TIME GOES BY, I AM ALSO GROWING UP ,AND MY THOUGHT, WERE NOT BEEN CONTORLED BY MY PARENTS, I WANT TO WHAT I WANT, LEARING SOMETHING I REALLY INTERESTED IN.
8.0	SO MORE MATURE THOUGHT MAKE ME NO LONGER RESTRICT.
8.0	AND THEN, SUCH A LITTLE MONEY CAN NOT CATCH MY ATTENTION,PASSION FOR LEARNING NATUARLLY DIMINISHES.
8.0	IN ONE WORDS,ONE THING YOU MUST DO IS NOT OFFERING MONEY BUT TO CHANGE YOUR CHILDEN MIND.
8.0	ONLY YOU THINK THAT HAVING BETTER COURESE IS THE ONE WAY TO GET SUCCESS, ONLY YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS FOR YOUR PARENTS TO AFFORD YOUR EDUCATION .
8.0	MAYBE, YOUR CHILD WILL BE TOUCHED, AND THEY WOULD KNOW STUDYING IS A RIGHT THING TO DO.
10.0	MONEY REPRESENTS SNOBERY,
3.0	Without doubt, Internet can provide plenty of information about almost everything.
3.0	However, now whether acessing so much information creates problems is controversial.
11.0	As for me, I think Internet indeed provide us many valuable information.
4.0	Firstly, the information Internet can provides is about varities of aspects and almost about everything, which is richer than books or newspapers or other printed things can provide.
8.0	As we know, because of the limited length, we can hardly see a book can contain much knowledge, however, this problem is easy to be settled by Internet.
8.0	If we use Internet to learn things, we can find many websites have almost everything we may be would like to know.
8.0	That's because Internet has unlimited capacity.
8.0	For example, if we want to know something about the whole history of humans, there are two methods we can choose.
8.0	The first way is to read books and other literature, which means we have to try to find as many books as we can and also only we go to mnay libraries can we find enough books we need.
8.0	Sounds we need to pay lot attention.
8.0	However, if we can choose the other way, using the Internet, we can easily get many information we want.
4.0	Secondly, using Internet means easier way to learn knowledge.
8.0	It's widely acknowledged that Internet made our lives more infficient, rapider and more convenient.
8.0	Nowadays, people don't have many free time to do what they want.
8.0	Most of us just have some break time, and because these time short and limited, it seems hard to make it useful by reading.
8.0	If we read during these time, we may even cannot find what we want when we need to go back to work or study again.
8.0	However, using Internet is a fascinating way to use these time.
8.0	By using the search engines, we can find the information we need faster.
8.0	Then we can receive those information everytime and everywhere if we want, just like when we wait for the bus.
8.0	It seems better to learn a little instead of doing nothing.
4.0	Internet indeed provide us many different information consists of valuable, practicle information or some boring and useless things.
9.0	However, it's our duty to indentify what we need and choose the best things to absorb.
9.0	Though there are so much information on the Internet that someone may feel confused and puzzled, it is not hard to learn to only learn what is beneficial.
2.0	All in all, though the Internet provides so many information may makes someone worried about it, I really believed that what we get whether valuable is up to ouselves, and most of us can get practicle information on the Internet.
12.0	According to the question ,my view is doing sports is more effective than blocking ourselves in the rooms watching TV or movies or reading books.
8.0	it is broadly acknowledged that doing sports does good to both physical and mental health, contributing to our all-around fitness.
8.0	Let me make up an example,when we feel angry or overstressed ,joging on the pavements in a park would be not more pleasant .
8.0	Or after a whole day beng stone in front of the screen,it is a present for you to free yourself on the bicycle ,wandering through the gentle night and the trees and bushes hugging flowers standing along the roads.
8.0	It is so relaxing to imagine ,not to mention put it int practice.
8.0	The warmness and the fraguents are cannot be obtained in lines or in seats.
8.0	Second to it ,its a double-win stragegy,while throwing off your buries,you also get the opportunity to win a pair of perfect body.
8.0	But think about our friends in the armchairs all day , they can only receive a pair of tiring eyes and a pair of painful legs ,which is just transfer our mental tirness to the physical one ,in which I beg for a differ.
8.0	Someone may says doing physical exercise is more difficult to access or to stick to ,nevertheless,its all-exercise time!
8.0	Everybody now can see the importance of exercising ,we can see the grandmathers dancing on the square,little children swimming in the long pool,ladies and gentlements sweating  on the heated competition on the summery playground.
8.0	While we enjoy ourselves in the sports ,we can absolutely free ourselves.
8.0	In our school ,teachers encourage us to spend more time on the tennis playground .
8.0	So, from my own angle,its beeter
3.0	Nowadays some parents offer their school-age children for each high grade they get in school.
11.0	I do not think it woukd be a good idea for the following reasons.
12.0	First and foremost, using money to stimulate child to learn might do harm to his learning habits.
9.0	As is generally acknowledged, learning is one of the elementary thing for every school-age child, and thus it is of vital importance to for a child to develop a good learning habit.
9.0	If learing is strongly connected with money, they may not be able to concentrate on learning and may focus on the monely solely, which means that the purpose of their learning may be directed to a wrong direction.
4.0	Second, money may lead to envy among the children.
8.0	For some children with poor grades and strong desire for money, it may finally result in their cheating in the exam.
8.0	And for those with good grades, they may be isolated and hated by others for the envy for the money they have.
8.0	It also increases the chance that they are bullied for money.
4.0	Last but not the least, the effect of encouragement to children may soon wear out after several times of , and the children may desire for more.
9.0	And once such desire is developed, it would be hard to wipe the influence off from a child.
9.0	It is dangerous to make a child too desirable for something that is normally used in the world of adults.
4.0	Some supporting the method may argue that money is a good encouragement to children with good grades, however we should recognize that exposing children to money too early may not be such a good thing.
10.0	Doing so might contribute develop their money persuing characteristic at a early age, which is definitely bad for their future development.
1.0	Over all, I do not think it woukd be a good idea.
1.0	Parents should think up better ways to help their children to learn better instead of simply giving money to encourage children.
3.0	The issue of whether the ability to relate well to people is more important than studying hard in school in order to succeed in a future job is highly debatable.
3.0	On one hand, studying well in school can help students get good grades which will lead them to a good university in the future.
11.0	Then, they can have a satisfactory job that means they are successful.
12.0	On the other hand, if a person has a great ability to relate well to people, they can have wonderful relationships with their friends which is benificial for them both for their job and now.
10.0	In the ultimate analysis, I contend that it is good for people' s future jobs if they pay more attention to their study in school.
6.0	Undeniably, it is very important for people to have great relationships with others.
8.0	Since when they are in school, they will meet many people.
8.0	Students need to spend lots of time studying at school that means they spend plenty of time staying with their classmates.
8.0	They can communicate about study, eat and play together.
8.0	By getting well with each other, they can gain a lot of benifits like knowledge and joy.
8.0	If students have problems, they have to ask their teachers for help.
8.0	So, they also need to be polite to their teachers which is also a way to relate well to others.
8.0	Therefore, relating well to people is significant to students.
1.0	However, studying well is more important than relating well to people.
1.0	If we do not study  well at present.
8.0	It is hard for us to have a good job in the future.
8.0	Now, our country has developed very quickly and there are many great people.
8.0	So, the competitions are very fierce.
8.0	We can not find a  great job in the future unless we have a beautiful graduate which needs high grades.
8.0	Take my elder brother as an example, he has a good ability to relate with others, so he has many friends.
8.0	However, he did not study hard in high school.
8.0	So he studied in a bad university.
8.0	He worked in a company which has low salary.
8.0	His friends can not help him because he do not know many skill.
3.0	In our daily lifes include different things, such as works, relaxing and so on.
3.0	At the same time, our has many choices can relax our body and mood.
3.0	For example watching a movie or reading a book, and doing physical exercise.
3.0	Different people wii have different methods.
11.0	In my opinion, watching a movies or reading a book better than doing physical exercise to makes me relaxing.
5.0	When I'm tired, I always watch a movies, also read a book, because it can relax my mood.
8.0	I can forgot bad things through watching a movies or reading a book.
8.0	In other aspect, I also relax my body , my brain, It is a good method, also a well- know method, because many young people always choose this method to relax them on weekend.
8.0	For exanple, I have many wokrs on today, and my work already use my many powers.
8.0	On this time, I watch a great movies, it can makes me happy, makes me full of power.
8.0	For reading a book to  realx our body also is this principle.
5.0	Many people said doning physical exercise also can relax ours.
8.0	It is truth, but it makes our body still tired, when we ready to study, I also feel very tired, because I cost my power on it.
8.0	On other aspect, watching a movie or reading a book can makes our mind to get more knowledge and idea.
8.0	When we ready to study, we can use the movie and book' knowledge.
8.0	It is good for our work and daiy life.
1.0	So in my opinion, watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.
1.0	Now, has many young people like watching movie, and their can get many knowledge on book.
7.0	It can helps them work
8.0	Nowadays, modern peopel are living under a lot of pressures,which result in little time for parens to accompany their children since they are so busy with their work.
8.0	Overwhelmed as parents are, they are desperate to leave some time for their kids.
8.0	However, there are lots of debate related to how to make use of this precious time.
8.0	Some individuals thinks that parents should spend time doing ativities relevant to schoolwork with their children, while others emphasize the signicance of fun games or sports.
8.0	From my perspective, I prefer the latter for the following reasons.
7.0	First and foremost, although study plays an important role in children's lives, playing
3.0	In current, many parents offer school-age money for each high grade .
3.0	I thnk this is a good ideal,by that I have two reason about this tropic , first if you offer money , that can reduce children pressure .
11.0	second they will konw thy must study effctive and work hard,so I think ths is a good ideals.
6.0	Offer money can make children to confetable syudy.
8.0	if doesn't  offer money .
8.0	The children will offer moner by them-self maybe they will feel pressure and can't  spent a lot time to study .
8.0	For example if one children can't offer their school-age money and he has a lot of homework , Maybe he can't fell live easy and have not a good grade ,then he can't  have confidence and feel a lot of pressure ,even he will do some exterm things .
8.0	so I think parens should offer their childern money.
2.0	this ideal will make childen study very hard .
10.0	because if they can't get a good grade ,  they can't get monny .
7.0	By that I mean children konw what they  should do , so they can have a puepose
7.0	and they wil
12.0	now there are many parents who give money  rewords to their children when they get good grades.
11.0	I think it is a good idea.
11.0	but after give money,they should also teach them how to use it.
5.0	i‘ve always advocated money rewards for children,especially for chinese children who're only children,because the chinese tradition of parents is to spend money on their children.
9.0	but if the parents just spend money on theit kids for no reason,it can lead to a bad future for them,if the money become a part of reward when the child get high grade, the child will realizes that it takes his efforts to get everything.
9.0	at the same time,let children learn how to control money.
5.0	for example，my sister's child was still in elemantary school.
8.0	While practicing the piano,my sister adopted the method of rewarding 1 yuan per hour,and if she did well in the competition,my sister would reward her 10 yuan or more.
8.0	In about three months,the little guy saved about two hundred or three hundred yuan.
8.0	but she didn't spend the money to buy toys or things that she only enjoyed herself.
8.0	she used her money to invite her father and mother to have a meal in her favorite restaurant,they all very happy.
7.0	so i do not think there is any bad influence in giving children money ,as long as parents can teach them how to use the
11.0	I strongly recommend that children need to learn from their mistakes.
11.0	Because in children's mind, there is no such thing is good or bad, when they facing a problem, they will make the decision by their own without any other's opinions, and they will compare their decision with others, and they will learn what is right.
11.0	In the circumstances we are talking about, I will list two different circumstances.
5.0	Firstly, making mistakes are the best way for children to learn.
8.0	For example, when I was a little boy, I was fasinating to play viedo games, there is no doubt that everyone will choose playing instead of studying, for me, the best thing is play video games.
8.0	And I can play it hole night even stay up late till the midnight.
8.0	But by the time you play more, you will forget every thing you have to do like homework, assignments from school and challenging exams.
8.0	Of course, I failed every things except playing games, I was really regret for the time I wasted, after all this things, I decided to make a difference.
8.0	And I learnt a lot about the mistake I was made.
5.0	Secondly, if my parents told me that I have to do those things that school required, I would argue with them because young students are very aggressive when someone say the words they don't like.
10.0	So apparently, there will cost more time for parents to persuade their children to do the things they think are right.
10.0	Additionally, learning is a prossing for every peo
3.0	In this day and age, with the advancement of science and thecnology, the world has greatly changed.
3.0	The inventions of Internent, smart phones and so on make our lives much more convinent, but in the meantime, they bring us many troubles.
3.0	This phenomenon has aroused a heated debate on whether our grandparents' suggestions are useful or not.
11.0	Somebady says that since they are too old to get in touch with the electronic devices, they do not know the world as much as we do, so we should not follow  their advices.
11.0	As far as I am concerned, I strongly disagree with the this kind of statement due to the following reasons.
5.0	First and foremost, grandparents have many life experiences, we can still learn from them.
8.0	Our grandparents do have experenced lots of historical moments, and they have already faced many essenal choices in their lives, it is needed for us to learn from them.
8.0	Just take my grandparents for example.
8.0	when I was still a freshman in my university, I lost my direction, did not know whether I should go abroad for further study or just find a job after my graduation.
8.0	I turned to my grandpa, who was already eighty and went to university at his time.
8.0	He told me since I was still young , I needed to broaden my horizons first.
8.0	That helped me to determined my mind.
5.0	Furthermore, grandparents are our closest relatives who know us well, they know what we really need.
8.0	Many of us were brought up by our grandparents, they spent lots of time in breeding us, we all had enjoyable memories.
8.0	They can put forward the suggestions which we really want.
8.0	One of my roommates  once broke up with his girlfriend and fell into great sorrow.
8.0	No matter how hard we tried to comfort him, it didn't work.
8.0	At last we called his grandparents since he was brought up by them.
8.0	His grandparents soon visited our dorm and told him to cheer up.
8.0	My roommate cameover  it in the end.
0.0	Admittedly, I am not denying that it will be difficult for our grandparents to catch up with this era.
0.0	However, they still have their own wisdoms we can learn from.
0.0	Their suggestions are still valuable for all of us.
3.0	How to identify a good job plays a crucial role in our daily life.
3.0	But whether it was easier to find what kind of vocation would lead to a successful future can be still a controversial topic.
12.0	Some people reckon that we can search a good job easily before because there were less fake news or wrong information in our daily life, while ,as for me , I do believe that it is easier to identify that kind of great job now.
5.0	Firstly, as we all know, with the development of technique , there are more and more ways for us to search what we want to know nowaday.
8.0	In this way, it is more convinent  for us to get the information about the ideal jobs.
8.0	For example,  at about 20 years ago, when my father graduated and wanted to own a secure and successful future, all the information about the jobs came from the student center in his college.
8.0	It was because there was no other way for him to get more ideas that he could only search his jobs in an limited number, which can not provide his favorite one.
8.0	But when my brother graduated last year, he can surf the Internet and gain what he want to know.
8.0	So situation became better than before.
5.0	Secondly, as far as I remember, we have great amount of new types of jobs so that it is more possible for us to choose an ideal one.
8.0	In other words , you have more choices.
8.0	My uncle's experience can be a good example.
8.0	After finishing all his schoolwork in his university,  he got a  job as a teacher.
8.0	But actually his major was math , which was not needed by any companys at that period of time.
8.0	So it was really a hard time for him.
8.0	"But luckily, as the time goes by, there is a new type of job named ""math modeling engnieer""  becoming popluar."
8.0	My uncle then learned some computer science by himself and finally got  secure and successful job.
2.0	In a nutshell, it is because of more ways to obtain the information and more new jobs nowadays that it is easier to identify a good job now.
3.0	There is an interesting debate on the internet in these days.
3.0	Should people follow with the dream which is too ambitous or a dream is more realistic for them.
11.0	Some people think they should choose to following the dream thant more realistic.
11.0	But I have an opposite opinion with them.
11.0	I think people should follow a great dream even they are not easy come true.
5.0	Firstly, after we presist to the ambitous goal, even we failed we also have a great achivement.
8.0	If we decide to choose the more diffcult dream, we have to pay more attention and energe on them.
8.0	So in these period, we already trained ourselves.
8.0	Compare with the people who aren't follow the diffcult dream, the will live with lower pressure.
8.0	Under this situation, this kind of people cannot have a better achievment that would suprise them.
8.0	For example, when my brother were in the middle school, he visited the Peking University which is the best college in our country during the summer vacation.
8.0	He was appealing by the beautiful enviroment and the great knowledge of this college.
8.0	But he was not the best students in his class, even he failed in some courseThen after he back to school, he begin to hard working to applicate this college.
8.0	During four years impressive hard study, after the pass the college test, he successed to apply the college with the second rank.
8.0	Even today, I am also suprise by the achievment of him, even he didn't apply the Peking University.
5.0	Secondly, we will have a chance to meet the people with same ambitious goal and these group of people will effect our future career.
8.0	We can have massive social relationship with these guys.
8.0	Even you failed, but your relationship are still exsit.
8.0	This bound would help you in your life.
1.0	To conclud, the ambitious goal will give you an important expercience of presist or othe precioul moral.
1.0	Beside, it would install a great relationship with someone who achieve the goal.
3.0	Recently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people: whether government should improve the appearance by improving the old building and streets or improve the safety by hiring more police to attract tourists.
3.0	Opinions vary from person to person.
3.0	Some people claimed that government should not improve the safety by hiring more police or improbe the appearence by improve the old building and streets to attract tourists.
10.0	However, I would stand on their opposit side and I believe  that government should improve the safety or improve the appearence by hiring more police and improving the old streets and buildings.
12.0	My viewpoints can be elaborated as follows.
5.0	Firstly, the good safty is the basic requirement of tourists.
8.0	People will choose the safer place to visit because they could have fun without any worry.
8.0	If the environment is full of danger, the tourrists would feel very nervous and could not enjoy themselves.
8.0	For example, there were not many police in our center park and people who often went there were not too much.
8.0	So our government hired more police to protect the safty of whole park.
8.0	Last week, I went to our center park and I saw the orderly line standing in front of the park.
8.0	I felt very safe and I found the amounts of tourists have became larger.
5.0	Secondly, a good appearence just repreasent a good business card which can attract more tourists.
8.0	For tourists, they would like to see the beautiful and relaxing landscape which can bring happiness to them.
8.0	If the appearence is very old, people would feel very bored and didn't get intersted in it.
8.0	For example, last year I went to Qingjiang River Gallery.
8.0	I fould the landscape are very beautiful.
8.0	There were many moutains and rivers and the air was very fresh.
8.0	I asked the tour guide whether the amouts of tourists are so many before, and the guide explained that the tourists became more and more is because this place had been rebuild three years ago.
10.0	To put
3.0	Recently,there's a trend in China that the old tried to pretent to fall down and appeal strangers to help them.
3.0	So,when the conscience stranger help the old to stand up,there will exist a problem for the other people who don't sya the whole process and they will easily to believe that's the stranger knock the the old down.
3.0	Considering the phenomenen happended in China,it's undoubt that people today are less to help the struggling strangers.
3.0	But I stand on the oppost point on this topic.
11.0	From my point of view,people are still and even more likely to help the strangers who are in trouble.
5.0	So,there are some evidences which can support my view.
8.0	Firstly,in the past few years,the relationship between our neibor was coming more harmonious.
8.0	In my daily life,it's common to see people who have some useless cloth and they tend to send them to the poor even they do not have any relationship.
8.0	More and more children are willing to donante thier comedies and textbook to the village school where they have never been to.
5.0	Secondly,from my point of view,even between contray and ocntray the relationship seems to be harmonious.
10.0	For example,China tries to bulid railways for some African contouries so that many young enigeers from China comes to the unfamiliar country to help those unknown poor people.
7.0	That's reveal a trend that there are more countries come to concentrate on helping others,unsuspeciesly the people form that cunt
12.0	I do not  think it is a good idea for both parents and their children to use money for high grade mark.
12.0	If parents only offer their school-age children money for each high grade mark they get in school,it will have a terrible influence on children at present and in the future.
6.0	Firstly,it will make children lose their independence.
8.0	Parents behavior indicates that they can offer help whenever children need and they do not have to work hard themslves.
8.0	Secondly,children may get the idea that money is everything,and they may believe that as long as they have money ,they have the whole world.
8.0	Children are more likely to Thirdly,children will be lack of the motivation to study hard.
8.0	Probably they will reckon their par
3.0	With the rapid growth of the society, people seem to be increasingly busy.
3.0	Different ages of people face various problems--- elder people suffer in disorders and students are under the high pressure of study.
3.0	While people suffering tough troubles, family always comfort and support behind them.
3.0	Hence, in my opinion, the extended family is more important now than it was in the past.
5.0	Initially, the closest people can be a good assistant in the daily life.
8.0	In the busy time, grandparents or  other relatives can help the person who are around 26 year-old solve the basic living requirement such as doing chores and cooking in order to save young people' s time.
8.0	For example, my aunt just stepped in the society, so she felt exhausted and tired about balancing the sechdule of work and other stuff like cooking.
8.0	After my parents knew the news, they helped her cook and do chores in her house.
8.0	Now she less exhausted and can devote much more energy to her work, so the working quality can be improved.
8.0	In anthor hand, the change of her emotion can show the importance of the extended family' support.
5.0	Moreover, people atr richer than before, so youcan let extended family invest you when you just a graduate who has no money.
8.0	For instance, if I want to own a reataurant, but I have no funds, Therefore, I should borrow money from banks or family.
8.0	However, there is far for enough, then another method is to get investation from my extended family.
8.0	The advantage of the method is that have less precedure comparing to the bank.
8.0	Thus, when making a big decision, the extended family also can be a strategy of handling the problem.
7.0	Given above the discussion, I think extend family is im
8.0	With the development of economy and technology,it provides more and more opportunities for the people to enjoy the life,which contributes much for them to living in the modern society that fulls of pressure and intensity.
8.0	There is a firece discussion that which way the people would like to.
8.0	Some people perfer a quiet way such as watching a movie or reading a book than doing physical exercise while others have a opposed opinion.
8.0	As far as I am cincerned,I aminto the former one for the following reasons.
6.0	In the first place,my physical condition was not allowed me to do too much exercise,therefore I developed a habit to do something that was not active to spend my leisure time.
8.0	And now,I am of great interestend in watching movies that I can totally addicted to it and forget all things related to me,especially the unhappiness or failure.
8.0	Of course,if I can't find some movies that I like,I will read the books.
8.0	As we all known,lots of movies are derived from the fictinos.
8.0	In fact,there is not much difference between them.
11.0	There is a common thought that if the student can score high in exams, it means that they have a decent command of the knowledge and it can also promise them to enjoy a bright future.
12.0	As parents are aware of the importance of chidren to get a high mark in the school, they are trying a large sum of methods to stimulate their children to study harder and better.
11.0	Some parents recognize that it may be a good idea to offer children money for each high grade they get in school.
11.0	I definitely agree with it for its influential benefits: a stimulus for children to study better, and a good chance to cultivate children to save money.
5.0	As a start, although it makes the parents feel stressed for the reward costs a lot,  a reward for children can inspire them to spare no effort to study and it's worthwhile to pay the money.
8.0	When I studied in primary school, my parents always promised to give me sufficient money to buy the latest pretty doll.
8.0	Consequently it became the motivation for me to review for the exam every day before the exam.
8.0	Finally I got a good mark to rank the first in my class and I was given money to buy my favorite doll.
5.0	Secondly, rewarding children by using money can cultivate an excellent habit of saving money, as they recognize the difficulty of earning money by working hard and they will cherish the money the earned themselves.
8.0	To illustrate, if I was given the money for my great score, I often accumulate it until it was time to use.
8.0	I realized the hardship of struggling to get a nice mark so I would not waste them.
8.0	And I often made use of them to purchase some precious gift for my parents as a return for their love and care on me.
2.0	To put it in a nutshell, a reward by money is really excellent idea to motivate children to learn harder.
3.0	Jobs are of great important to modern people, which enable people to support their families and enjoy a sense of achievement, Recently, an increasing discussion has arisen about which one is a better choice of  work style: workers do many different types of assignment will be more enjoyable or they focus on a similar tasks all day long during the workday.
3.0	Undoubtedly, doing different typles of tasks is good for workers to reliese work stress sometimes when during the workday, however ,personally speak, I will choic the othe work style.
12.0	My reasons and examples are given below.
5.0	First, we will able to be more concentration during the workday, when hard work that we always be disturted by other thing ,that make us  cannot work well, so if you do similar works you will be very familer to do that,because of you do not have to spend time to learn it before you do the tasks.
8.0	Taking my brother for example, Ben , the man whose can  very foucs on his job  in all day long, someday, his boss want him to do other projects  sometimes when he do his thesis about the company teamwork, because his boss need the project to have a report.
8.0	this is really make him very fracstrate and finally he cannot finnish one thing.
8.0	it is really make him cannot concentrate on his tasks.
5.0	In adiition, Our work efficiency will able to be improved when we do similar tasks all day long, becasue the assignments are a fmiler fields that you can easy to do that, one thing that you know it ,that make you have a short pace to access it.
10.0	for example, when i have my first job is a salesman in supermarket, i know my advantage is talking to each other ,and this ability also is my secret weapon , so I tell my manager that only do a work I talk with coustoms and intruduct our products and you cannot give me other thing to do ,finnally ,I only do this work and improved my company profits,
10.0	from
11.0	I agree that parents should let childrem make mistakes and let them learn from thier own mistakes.
12.0	Here is my reasons.
11.0	Firstly,when students make mistakes,they need to take thier own responsibility.
11.0	Thus they will have a sense on responsibility.
8.0	For example,President George broke his neibour's window when he was playing football.
8.0	His parents asked him to apologize and pay the money by himself.
8.0	He then knew he needed to pay for what he did.
5.0	Secondly we can learn how to solve the problems.
8.0	Lian po is a famous general in ancient China.
8.0	He looked down upon Linxiangru,one of his collegues.
8.0	But Linxiangru did'n complain about it and tried to avoid encounter him.
8.0	When Lianpo knew that he actively apologized to Lianpom.
8.0	From the example we can know that somtimes we can learn how yo solve the problems by makeing mistakes.
8.0	We can learn to compromise when we misunderstand each other.
8.0	Then we may get a double win results.
5.0	Thirdly we can practice our ability to change bravely.
8.0	When you undertand that mistakes are not available,you will never be afraid of making them.
8.0	For example,when Renzhengfei(a Chinese business man) was young,his parents advised him to do plenty of part time jobs.
8.0	He was abused,refused by others because of his mistakes a lot of times.
8.0	But from that time on he understood that mistakes are unavoidable and was succeed in his businiss.
7.0	SOI agree that parents should let childrem make mistakes and let them learn from thier own mistakes
3.0	I dont think use money to encuorage children to effort to study is a wisdom idea.
12.0	i think study is a preasonal think,i even think parents shuoldn't intervene their children‘s study.
5.0	All we know,we studynot only for other,but for ourselves.
8.0	And further,we study not only for our fulture,job and salary,but also to improve our mental stature and get more knowledge.
8.0	The test,is just to examine our study,find our weaknesses,to help us studying better.
8.0	if we study just for get a high grade,the study will make no sense.
8.0	parents give children maney to reward their have a high grade,which will make children think 'study is just for get money' 'i'm working for my parents'.
8.0	In the long run,they will lose their enthusiasm,their even will think study and get money,is common.
8.0	this is really harmful to their further study.
5.0	On the other hand,money rewards may induce children to lose honesty.
7.0	they may cheat
12.0	In the era of protecting people's humanity, more and more attention has been focused on how to make the workers more satisfied, as it is not only the respect to the people who work for the progress of the entire human race, but also can make the work more efficient, which is excatly what the supervisors need desperately.
12.0	After quantities of practice and trials, some academics reach the conclusion that workers can be more satisfied to have different types of work to do than just doing the same tasks.
11.0	And I am completely in for that opinion.
5.0	First and foremost, it is acknowleged that once the similiar missions are done for hundreds of times, people will get tired and lose their interest in them.
8.0	And taht will definitely make the workers less satisfied.
8.0	Here vomes an authentic example based on my own experiences.
8.0	There was a time I was preparing for the most important test to be admitted to the universities.
8.0	During the whole year, I had been reciting the knowledge points and solving difficult math questions.
8.0	It feels fine at the beginning, but later I just can't presist because the similiar tasks just occupied my life entirely, which is more than boring and exhausting.
8.0	I had a hard time to make every endeavor to hold on to it.
8.0	But the situation went worse I just can't be happy and satisfied every day.
8.0	Every time I reflect on that time, I think that I should spend more time for leisure so that it wouldn't be that boring.
5.0	What is more significant is that when people are able to get in touch with different kinds of distributions, their curiosity will be satisfied greatly, which will make their life more colorful, thus leaving their satisfication in work boosting.
8.0	And Huawei's earlier practice have prove that it is right.
8.0	Huawei has been noticing that the programmers' being less efficient due to the low satisfaction.
8.0	So here came the policy that the programmers can also get a job in the field of manegement of the company.
8.0	And that is probably what it is makes Huawei's success today.
8.0	Through this case we canbe sure that the diversity of tasks can truly make the staff more satisfied.
10.0	Here comes my conclusion that
3.0	Nowadays, leaders play an important role in people's daily life.
3.0	We cannot do a thing well without a good leader.
11.0	However, some people think leadership comes naturally, and one cannot learn to be a leader.
12.0	Is it true?
12.0	I definitelly diagree with this idea.
11.0	It is highly possible for someone to be a leader.
6.0	First of all, we can learn to leading skills by practicing.
8.0	All kinds of skills come from experiences, by trails and errors we can learn a lesson and know how to do better next time we meet the same problem.
8.0	Once, my English professor divided  us into several groups to do a PPT about American culture.
8.0	And I was the leader of my group.
8.0	It is my first time to be a leader and I didn't know how to manage different parts of the work well at the beginning.
8.0	By trying, I understood that as a leader, I ought to give the work by their personal talents and I need to make good use of their advantages.
8.0	Then, I let the person who was good at writing to finish the writing part, who likes reading to look for information and so on.
8.0	Finally, we made good achievements and got high grades at the team work.
8.0	So it is possible for a people to cultivate leading skills.
2.0	What's more, leading skills can be improved by learning form others.
7.0	In all ages, there are many famous and great leaders in the history, such as Pressident Washington,
3.0	Nowadays, due to the rapid development of society, the issue of the director of development has become an increasingly controversial topic.
3.0	Some believe governments should develop internet access.
11.0	while others believe they should promote transportation.
11.0	Although I have some doubts, I tend to agree with the latter, and I will articulat my view below.
4.0	First, a great public transportation can bring convenience to people life.
8.0	Nowadays, most of people need to commute between house and work place.
8.0	Under this condition, it is important for persons to own a convenient transportation which can save lots of time for those humans.
8.0	And if citizens want to go someplace for entertainment, it is convenient for people to use the great transportantion.
4.0	Besides, it is benefit that the transportation can bring to some company.
8.0	If the govenment want to promote the transportatiion, they have to find some company to do coorporation.
8.0	Therefore, it is a chance for those company to develop transportation.
8.0	Moreover, the better the transportation will be done, the more benefits the company will get.
8.0	For example, not only the government will continue to do coorporation, but other cities' government also will coporate to it.
4.0	Finally, improving the transportation can bring benefits to the city.
10.0	Due to the great transportation,
3.0	As society develops fast , the activities of the young people have become diverse.
3.0	Besides working hard in the classroom ,  students nowadys hang out with their friends after class or they can go to the cinema and watch a film.
3.0	T There is no denying that young people's lives have become colorful and stimulating.
11.0	However, it is true that young people have little time to help the communities.
5.0	Firstly, young child tend to entertain themselves and have fun during their part time.
8.0	The highly-developed technology has provided people with various approches to entertain.
8.0	From playing computer games in their home to visiting an art museum and participating in some interrsting activities, the youth have too many item to participate in and too many choices to make.
8.0	What's more, these choices are far more exciting to help their communities.
8.0	I still remember during my primary school , too many parents complained that their childern were immersed in the world of high technology.
8.0	Once the child came home from school, they would throw their school bag aside , lie down on the sofa and turn the television on.
8.0	They would bury themselves to the television for a long time and even did not respond to their parents.
8.0	During the weekend, they would go out with their friends to watch a movie or playing computer games together.
8.0	From the case above, there are more interesting things for kids to do nowadays and how could they spare their time to help the communities.
5.0	What is more,  students now have heavier study burden and they have hardly have time to help the communities.
8.0	It is known to all that nowadays the competition among the students have become finance and students all spare no efforts to work hard and get a good grade.
8.0	Take my neighbor for example.
8.0	He is a student who is in the third year of the high school.
8.0	To prepare for the examination of entrance to the university, he almost make full use of his time.
8.0	Early in the morning when the sky is still dark, he has already get up and writing on the paper.
8.0	Late in the night when everyone has gone to bed and sleep, he is still awake and reading books.
8.0	From weekdays to the weekends, I hardly see him even take a walk outside his home.
8.0	Since the students nowadays make full use of their time to study, how culd they spare time to help in the communities.
1.0	Although some people contend that the youth besides the child and students may have the time to help the communities, they have their own task to finish and their own goal to attain.
1.0	Univerisity students work hard for agood job and the young employee work hard to earn more money.
7.0	Therefore, young people har
11.0	Getting to know a person is important in our daily life when we want to communicate smoothly with him or her.
11.0	Only when we fully understand a person can we easily find common topics or start a conversation with him.
11.0	And it is also the first step to develop friendship.
11.0	Tthere are several ways to get to know a person.
9.0	Some people prefer to judging a person according to  his appearance, while others may learn about a person from the activities that he participates in.
9.0	As for me, I think observing the books and movies that the person likes is an efficient way to understand him.
5.0	First and foremost, the person's favorite books and movies reflect his personality.
8.0	Reading books and watching movies can satisfied the emotional requirement of a person.
8.0	So the preference of books and movies show the characteristics of the person.
8.0	If a person is outgoing and humorous, he may prefer to watching comedies, for this sort of movies are relaxing and can make him feel happy.
8.0	While a serious person are likely to read books related to politics or some serious themes.
5.0	In addition, books and movies provide information of the person's hobbies.
9.0	Usually, we prefer to reading books or watching movies related to what we like to do.
9.0	For example, a person who like sports may favors movies talk about football or basketball activities, while a person who like play the instruments may like movies related to classical music.
0.0	Last but not least, according to the books and movies he likes, we can know what he is going to do.
0.0	Some books can serve as tool books because they include related information about one specific field.
0.0	People usually only read these books under special circumstances or before certain events.
9.0	For example, many books talk about travel and there are numerous images and information related to the architecture, food and customs in different countries in those books.
9.0	If a person likes reading this kind of books, it is probable that he is planning for his trip in vacation.
11.0	I disagree with the statement that it is better to relax yourself by watching a movie or reading a book than by doing physical exercise.
12.0	As we all known,everybody has his own hobby and habit.
11.0	So,everyone may have his own way that is more proper for himself to relax.
12.0	People who are quiet and gentle may like the quiet way such as watching movies or reading books.
11.0	The energetic people may like the physical exercise more to relax themselves instead.
11.0	Moreover,the ways people chose to relax themselves also depend on different mood.
6.0	Watching a movie and reading a book is a quiet way for relaxing.
8.0	We can just be absorb in the books and the movies which make us laugh or sob,and think about the plots in it.
8.0	Then we will foget what make us upset in the real life.
8.0	My best friend is a gentle girl who likes reading books most.
8.0	She read books every night after hard work in the school.
8.0	Once we had a test in class, and she failed the test and got a D in the subject.
8.0	She just went to the dormitory and took out an interesting book to read.
8.0	Finally she laughed loudly in her room.
2.0	On the other hand, the energetic people may chose more dynamic way to relax like me.
10.0	After a physical exercise such as running or playing balls,we may sweat fully and delightfully.
7.0	As we all known,the graduate students are under too much pressure worrying about the job and the
3.0	There is  a tough discussion about which one does workers prefer, many different types of tasks or only one task?
3.0	In other words, it is a issue about perseverance and changeable personality.
12.0	From my perspective, foncusing on one specific task enables them to grasp this task, which effectively boots their efficiency.
4.0	Firstly, doing similar task everyday can bulid up a persons's good quality.
8.0	Perseverance is a kind of pesonality that we appreciate it.
8.0	There are so many athletics consist their sports in order to achieve their dreams.
8.0	For instance, Guo Jingjin is a successful celebrity who has won countless gold medals for our country.
8.0	it is years of hardwork that could make her what she is today.
4.0	Admittedly, it may be true that people tend to try something new because of the security.
9.0	However, this alone does not provide sufficient support to claim that works are satisfied with different tasks.
9.0	Because it will decline our efficiency, we increasingly lose the enthustic on anything and become alone.
4.0	Finally,  only if we practice one subject billions of times, will we enable to chase our goals which   are beyond our dreams.
10.0	Kobe's success has no luck with him, he only has to practice and focus on basketball in man
1.0	Which one I preder depends on my own experience, life style and emotional cocerns.
1.0	To be frank, I would like to agree with that workers are more
3.0	The topic that whether it's better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise has aroused various arguments and debates.
3.0	Arguments are varid thanks to the different opinions come from diversity backgrounds.
11.0	When it comes to me, I have a tendency to support the idea that I disagree with the statement the topic shows and I consider physical exercise is better than wathcing a movie or reading to relax.
12.0	My view derives from a close examination from the perspectives over the physical and psychological health.
4.0	Firstly, doing physical exercise can improve one's physical health.
9.0	Take me as an example, when I was doing exercises after work or study, I could feel my body released and strengthen in that when working and studying, I need to sit on the chair for a long period of time.
9.0	And also, via exercising, I could also feel my fats was burning, through which I overcomed obesity at the same time.
4.0	Also, through the process of exercising, one can feel mentally relaxed.
8.0	One must concentrate on their own work or class during work time.
8.0	During this process, one's brain must be very tired and need to relax.
8.0	compared with watching a movie or reading a book, physical exercise can liberate one's mental in that exercising can drop one's pressure and totally relax.
8.0	As for watching a movie or reading, brain still needs to join in this process and cannot be totally relaxed.
4.0	Someone claims that doing physical exercise is not better than watching a movie and reading a book to relax because doing exercise can hurt their bodies.
10.0	However, their opinion can be proved pale by the following arguments.
4.0	First, doing exercise is fundamental to a person's healthy dailly life.
8.0	It's normal for one person to get injured when doing sports, but these injuries are usually not severe.
8.0	Second, nowadays people have many tools to protect their bodies such as helmets can protect heads.
8.0	One can avoid injuries once he or she have enough protections.
2.0	On balanced, I stand for the opinion that It is better to relax by doing physical exercise than by watching a movie or reading a book.
3.0	In the 20th century, technologies made our life more beautiful.
3.0	People have many different types to relax, especially the teenagers.
3.0	Like watching movie, playing computer games and reading books, these are normal things we do in our spare time.
11.0	But someone will say that it is just somethings suit to lazy guys, those are unhealthy ways to our bodies; as a healthy and powerful person, weshould do some sports and exercise to relax ourselvies.
8.0	Of course, there will be different views to the ways to relax.
8.0	someone think we can do some relax things, some one think we should do some exercise to keep fit.
8.0	But in my opinion, do some sports will be better to our life.
6.0	Some times, we will want to watch movies or do something quiet to relax.
8.0	Yes, it will make you relax well and put you in a peaceful world, make you happy and clear the tiredness.
8.0	However,you stay there and never move, it will hurt your phisical health, your weight will increase,and many diseases will come to you.
8.0	Believe me, it will make you uncomfortable in the future.
8.0	But, take exercise in your spare time is different.
8.0	First, it can make you have a more powerful body, your shape will be more perfect, then your can attack more eyes from others, even in the interview, you can get a higher grades from the boss.
8.0	Second, after doing sports, you will feel confortable, even a little tired, it will just make you sleep better, them you wil full of energy tomorrow.
8.0	Third, the sports are your interest,you can make more friends by this, you have more topics to talk to others.
8.0	And I believe that the interests like football, running, swimming and biking will be better than watch movie or play computer games.
1.0	So, according that, I think take some exercise to relax will better than watching a movie or reading a book.
1.0	Take exercise can benefit us many facses.
12.0	I don't think is a good idea, Beacause children do not need more moeny in school.
12.0	The task of children is to learn instead of spending money.
8.0	If they were brought up to spend money from childhood,they would spend more and more money when they grew up.
8.0	What we need to cultivate is the economical quality of our children.
8.0	If children have the quality of saving .
8.0	they will have a lot of benefits when they grow up ,such as metaphor ,not spending moeny freely ,shopping wiil consider man problems and so on  so I don't think is a good idea
3.0	Whether the past or nowdays, many people succeed by searching for help from their family.
3.0	Some people think that it is easier to succeed by the families' assistence in the past.
3.0	Others reckon that people can achieve success with help from their families now easier than the past.
12.0	As far as I an concerned, it is simple to obtain the success with families' help nowdays than before.
5.0	Above all, at present, people can get comfort and confidence from family easily.
8.0	For example, in the past, my mom was far away from my grandparents.
8.0	Once she met a problem whether change her job or not, but she could not attach my grandparents instantly and she could not make a choice immediately by herself so that she did not focus on her present job.
8.0	And she was fired by her company employer.
8.0	None of good job she could find again.
8.0	However, I have the same situation with my mom's.
8.0	Thanks to the convenient mobile phone, my mom provide me the confidence and let me stay in my company.
8.0	Now, I am prompted by my boss.
8.0	Therefore, we have more advanced technology now which make us achieve success easier than before.
5.0	What's more, now, our family's horizon is different from the past.
10.0	For instance, my dad's degree is just elementary school.
3.0	I agree with the statement that it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.
3.0	Here are my opinion below.
3.0	Nowadays Chinese students have lots of pressure from their academy work.
3.0	Most of them do not have much time on their  hobbies,such as playing basketball or watching a fantastic movie.
3.0	Amout of homework will not keep their physical and emotinal health.
3.0	Therefore,they need to go outside when they having the relax time.
3.0	I also suggest these students to go the cinema to have a good time on a movie.
3.0	It will open their mind and expand their imaginations.
3.0	Some of the movies are speaking English,and it can improve their ablility of expression.
3.0	Reading books in English is also a good way for them to realx.
3.0	Students can learn the grammar and a lot of vocabulary in one book.
12.0	Both of them are active for students' devlopment in future.
6.0	Doing some physical exercises in the spare time is a nice suggestion,but we can not just only do this work when we relaxed.
8.0	we should take more foucus on study.
8.0	So watching a movie or reading a book is much better than doing physical exercise.
8.0	I have someown experience for doing physical exercise.
8.0	When I have done some physical exercise like playing basketball or golf,I can not take 100 percent attraction on study working.
8.0	However,I always can get a lot of power of study when I have read a book.
8.0	The mainly reason of this is the hero in the book can inspire me have the passion on my study,but I could only feel tiered when I played the physicl exercises.
2.0	In addition,I suppose watching a movie or reading abook is the better way of relax than doing physical exercise.
7.0	We can get more active power when we hve done the form
3.0	Nowadays people are busy with their study and work,and it's becoming more and more substantial for them to find a ideal way to relax themselves.
3.0	And different people have distinguished opinions on which is better to relax,some of them prefer to stay quietly,watch a movie or read a book,while others are interested in doing physical exercise.
12.0	As far as I'm concerned,I think doing physical exercise is a much better way to relieve ourselves.
6.0	First of all,doing sports make us active and vigorous.
8.0	As we have seen that today's students spend most of their time sitting before desks and learning all day,employees work with their computers and they all hardly remove from their offices.
8.0	What's more,when we are in such great pressure,we often feel dull and exhausted,making us find difficulty in concentrating on our works.
8.0	And frankly speaking,when we are sleepy enough after whole day's learning and wroking,reading a book or watching a movie usually make us harder to keep high spirit.
8.0	Physical exercise,however,can make our bodies motion,which will bring us enengy,and there is no doubt that this will help us becomre more vigorous and concentrative,which is good for our works finally.
3.0	Nowadays, with development of society the people getting more rich than the past.
12.0	So many people tendto go to traveling most people like traveling in own country instead of traveling to foreign countries, because it can save the many and is no language barrier.
12.0	But l have different idea, l think traveling to foreign countries we can touch different people and custom.
6.0	First of all, tourist diiferent countries we can meet some different people, as we know tourist attractions usually have people from different countries that we can community with each others and to learn about other cultures.
8.0	If we traveling in the own country we will don't have any change to meet some people from different countries.
8.0	For example, last year l go to Thailand l went to  the beach, but l get lost. l ask someone, lickily, he also went to the beach, so l took his car reachend the beatch.
8.0	In the car we talk a lot of own country's culture.
11.0	In my opinion studying in the school is a very important part in a persons life, but for me I think relate to people is more important because the way to success is not show how much you know is base on what you can do.
11.0	But still people have to take base education, that is the base ability for everyone.
4.0	Study hard in the school can make people have more knowledge and is a good way to show you are a people who work very hard, that mean you probobaly also wil be good the in the future cause you work hard on everythings.
4.0	However in this socialty today the ability to relate people well is somethings we must need, if a people do not know how to relate with people even he have lot of knowledge he still do not have time ande chance to show his ability.
10.0	And relate ability can give people lot of chance.
4.0	In my life there was a guy he was very good in collage.
8.0	He study in a top 10 collage in United State.
8.0	After that he went to a big company in Shanghai, everyone think he will be very success but he does not.
8.0	He stay in that company for a week and he come back.
8.0	The reason the company give him is he almost never talk to any people.
8.0	And also my tennis coach is a oppsite example.
8.0	He took collage in a regular school, but after the collage he try his best to find some rich people to teach them tennis, cause of that he learn lot of bussiness knowledge from them so for now he is doing very good the his market company.
3.0	Do you have some favourite entertainers or athletes?
3.0	Do think they need more privacy to enjoy their free time now?
11.0	In my opinion, I think they need more privacy because they are also human so they will have a lot of private things to deal with just like common people.
10.0	And if their life is disturbed by media too often, they may feel very nervous and eventually they may suicide.
5.0	Firstly, these super star they are  human so they need to spend time to deal with some private things.
8.0	For example, they may find a girl friend or boy friend if they are single; and the also should take some time to play with their parents or friends such as travel around the world.
8.0	But nowadays some medias and some young people pay too much attention to their private life----when some super stars or big player go out to have a meal, they will take photoes.
8.0	And even these famous people do anything, these medias will follow with them to find some news.
8.0	We can imagine that when we go out to do everythings, there always have some people following with us and try to find some striking things.
8.0	We must will feel very unhappy and we will be very carefully when we go out.
8.0	So it is why now when these famous people go out, they all will not show their face.
8.0	Clearly, they need more private space nowadays.
5.0	Secondly, these entertainers and athletes are all very pressure, however, there still have a lot of medias or fans to disturb their life so they may suicide.
9.0	A lot of super stars and big players will meet aboundant trouble in their career, for example, super stars need to go around the world for work even have no time to sleep; some big player have to play very well in the game wheather their fans will disappoint.
9.0	Unfortunatelly, their life are often disturded by soem fans or medias and some medias even spread some rummer about some affair about them.
7.0	If they are not hard enought, they ma
3.0	We always meet some problems at some public place, and we need to choose the best way to solve it.
12.0	So i prefer to wait until the class or the meeting is over and the people are gone, then talk to the teacher or meeting leader.
4.0	Firstly, it's polite for us  choose an appropriate time to illustrate our opinion.
8.0	In our life, we need to respect others.
8.0	when other people is talking,althouth we have different ideas, it's impolit to interrupt others.
8.0	we need to be an good audience.
8.0	If you correct the mistake right way, your teachers or leaders will ne angry or embarrasing because there are many other people.
8.0	It will broke the relationship between you and your leader.
8.0	Although your answer is correct, you be behavior won't be approved because you did't respect others.
4.0	Secondly, it will be a good opportunity for us to communication.
8.0	It's normal for people havediverse opinion, so we can talk with others, and change our idea, then combine them to make a good result.
8.0	For instance, we always have tam wor in the class, so it will be a good chance for us to learn form others, people have various ability, they can do well in some different area.
8.0	sSo when they work together, they will gain a better job.
4.0	Thirdly, although some people didn't like others to correct their mistake because they think it's shameful.
8.0	None wants to laugh others, they are friendly.
8.0	From this way, we can know our disadvantage, then try to correct them.
8.0	And make ourselves better.
8.0	It won't be harmful to anyone.
8.0	They can benefit form this chance.
8.0	So people don't need to worry about anything because they will choose a suitable time.
2.0	In conclusion, When we correct others we can also know what we are not good at.
3.0	In these days, there were an interesting debate on the internet: communicate with your colleagues and classmates in person or emails, which would you choose?
3.0	Some people would choose to talk with friends in a social app.
11.0	But I have a different opinion, I think is would be better if we communicate in person.
5.0	First, communicate with your friends or colleagues in person would use more unoffical words to illustrate your idea better.
8.0	When I was writing an email, I always confused by how to the approprite offical words.
8.0	Some words were used to talking wiht elder and some were used to stranger.
8.0	It's diffcult to choose which word is the most closed to your meaning.
8.0	But in the off-internet conversation, we can have a derict talking enviorment.
8.0	For example, my classmate and I were disscused about some topic which assign from our teacher.
8.0	We have a short conversation on internet.
8.0	But we both have a feeling that it was too unconvnience by typing the words.
8.0	Then we meet at the liberay.
8.0	This time, we can speak  more derict and exchange our idea faster than through emails.
5.0	Seconly, face to face talking is more polite.
8.0	We always using email to submit our new homework and announce some new policy.
8.0	But when we meet out cleint or some important conversation, email were not the best choice.
8.0	This way cannot show your cultivate, it might give people a bad apperence.
7.0	For example, when we were meet our claint to introduce your new products, you should better to show them in your office, that you can give them a  cla
3.0	Nowadays,many parents offer their chidren money for high marks in exams.
3.0	In my opinion,it has both advantages and disadvantages.
11.0	For the positive effects,chidren can be more exited and be more interested in studying.
11.0	What's more,they can use these money to buy something they need such as some classic books and school things for their study.
12.0	Also,they can put away the money and use them when they grow up.
12.0	For example,they may use them to travel around the world in college with friends or they can contribute to the poor people.
11.0	In these ways i mention about,they can experience a lot and learn a lot.
6.0	However,chidren may use the money in a inproper way like buying a lage amount of sacks,or even worse,they may buy wine and cigrettes.
8.0	In these ways they may keep some bad habits,which can bring chidren a lot of damages.
8.0	What's worse,they may have a idea that they can depend on their parents forever and they don't have to study hard,then get into a good university,then get a high-paid job and have their own life.
8.0	Also,chidren may get an idea that they are studying for money and working for money,they are not studying hard for themselves!
8.0	In this way,they may get bored in studying and only dream for money.
8.0	As aresult,they don't have their beliefe anymore.
8.0	If parents don't give them money from time to time,they may get mad at their parents and have a fight with them.
8.0	How terrible it may be.
1.0	For those reasons i give,we can have a conclusion that it is better not to give chidren money when getting high marks.
1.0	If parents must do this,i sugget parents keep the money for chidren and give chidren when growing up.
3.0	Teaching,as a traditional way to pass on the experience and knowlege from generations to generations ,has long been cherished through out the human history.
3.0	Undoubtedly, teachers always exerts great influence on their young pupils,no matter the knowlege itself,or the insights of life and moral values.
3.0	"Although nowadays we often mention the phrase ""peer education ""to illustrate the importance for the students to be positively influenced by their friends,the fact that students are greatly influenced by their teachers can never be overlooked."
5.0	As far as I'm concerned,the basic influence that teachers influence their students is knowledge.
8.0	Compared with our peers,the teachers are often older in age,and richer in knowledge as well.
8.0	Take my own experience as an example,my supervisor had been in a research program for several years before he finnally became a teacher.
8.0	Years of researches in the lab have earn him quite a amount of knowlegde,which my peers have no way to manage as he does.
8.0	He always tell me some knowledge and tips of certain experinments to prevent me from making big mistakes and I am very grateful.
5.0	Teachers always influences their students in the ways they deal with problems,a good techer may set a good example that is beneficial for students' future development,which your classmates can never do as well.
8.0	It was a saturday night last semester when I found some data went wrong in my experinment,which meant I had to run the same experinment all over again.
8.0	Desperate and disheartened as I was,I managed to revise some of the bad data.
8.0	It was soon found by my boss,of course he was very angry and disappointed with me,for him torn the data paper into pieces at once.
8.0	After he calmed down,he told me that a reseacher could never go beyond the bottomline to fake the data.
8.0	With patience,he encouraged me to work this out again and could turn to him for help whenever I needed it.
8.0	I was deeply moved and never had a similar attempt since then.
10.0	In conclusion,students a
11.0	I don not think it is easy to say yes or no.
11.0	Because it depends on the reason how you become tired.
11.0	It has been demonstrated that if are a brain worker,it is better to do physical exercise.
12.0	But if you are worker,it is better to do something quiet like sleeping or watching a moive or reading a book.
4.0	As everyone knows,there are many people working in the office and it is always the case that they died of working without realxing.
8.0	Searching for the reason why they may die.
8.0	Not beacause they do not whatching a moive or reading a book but they are lacking of exercise.
8.0	I quiet agree with the idea that we need keep a blance of Ying and Yang to be healthy.
8.0	If your work needs you to sit and meditate a lot.
8.0	To keep health you would better exerse more.
4.0	On the other hand,if you work needs a lot of energy a lot though,why you go to a gym after work?
10.0	So it is better to think about the work itself.
4.0	And the most important part of this question is the man himsely.
9.0	Maybe it is better to relax by doing  physical exercise but they do not have time or the gym is far away from the the place.
9.0	From my opinion it is Ok to be quiet.
0.0	"In short,this kind of question can not be answered by"" I agree..."
0.0	"or I disagree ..."""
0.0	The best answer varies form different comditions.
0.0	So it is better to know the exact information to answer this question.
11.0	Someone have said that it's better to relax by watching amovie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.
11.0	I don't think so.
11.0	But I am also not disagree.
12.0	I think we should have various kinds of opinions to face it.
5.0	Watching a movie or reading a book has its advantages for the relaxing.
8.0	Because our brains are in the highly tense situation.
8.0	So it's a good chance to make the brain relaxed.
8.0	We don't need to think many things about the study or the society.
8.0	But,it still has disadvantages.
8.0	We can become lazier and more imtalktive because of the lonely enviroment.
8.0	You can also be addicted to it,maybe.
8.0	I think we should do it suitable rather than take too much times.
5.0	Doing physical exercise also has it's advantages for the relaxing.
8.0	It is good for your body.
8.0	Because we have sat for too much time every day.
8.0	It can cause some healthy problems.
8.0	In the other hand,it is a good chance to make more friends that make your life become happier and more active.
8.0	"Well,a good saying says that""one coin has two sids."""
8.0	Playing too much  sometimes can affect the study.
8.0	Because when we come back to the class,we need to have a time to calm down.
8.0	And we can easily get hurt when we are in the exciting exercise.
1.0	So we need to make a sense of what to choice or what to drop.
1.0	We should know what is the most important thing to do in the high school time.
11.0	With the development of the work and the society, people need to do a lot different things during one day.
12.0	But is it really very efficient?
11.0	I think the answer is no; we do a lot different things for one day will let us fell very tired and it is not very efficient.
11.0	So for this opinion I think we do very few things is very reasonable and very efficient.
11.0	I agree with the point people do very few things well.
6.0	To do a lot of different things will let us feel very tried and with the time go on the efficience of us will decrease, which means our brain will be faint.
8.0	Most of people they are busy for whole day; they really want to finish or gain more work or information but they ignore a very important thing--the quality of the work they finish and the information they truly gain.
8.0	The energy of people is limited and the work we can do or knowledge we can absorb is limited.
8.0	For example, last year I prepare for my college entrance examination which is a make-or break exam; it even determine the future of my life.
8.0	So I want to gain a lot of information for one day and I try my best to study more knowledge.
8.0	I feel very busy and I study a lot of subjects for one day just like Math, Chinese and English.
8.0	The odd thing is I study so busy but my grades did not have much progress; always at the middle level of our class.
8.0	I feel very sad however my teacher give me some advices that I can do less things for whole day but to do it very carefully.
8.0	Fortunately, this is a good methods; to do this not only alleviate the pressure of mine but also make me very efficient.
8.0	As a result of that, even though I just do very few things, I digest them very well; I have very clear brain for whole day.
8.0	Finally, the the end of the college entrance examination is very good; I breathe a sigh of relief and thanks so much to the method that just do few things a day but do them well.
2.0	Second to do a lot of different things will make a lot of mistakes which is not good for the goverment or a company.
7.0	We all
12.0	I would not agree with the idea that parents offer a bonus for their children for the high grade they get in school.
12.0	And here are the reasons why i hold the oppinion.
5.0	First of all, i need to illustrate my point of view on studying.
8.0	Everyone has his/her job, and us students' job is study.
8.0	And more than doing a job, studying is what we are supposed to do to the best of our ability.
8.0	So, getting the high grade is not something out of a student's responsbilities.
8.0	But i have too highlight that not getting a high grade is not something that should be punished.
5.0	Only with the oppinion above is inadequate to support my point of view.
8.0	Here we comes to another point-- the money.
8.0	A school-age child is not mature enough to handle money in a proper way.
8.0	Having extra money, especially when the amount of money is not small, could lead to incorrect attidutes towards money.
8.0	And what can be even worse is that the incorrect attitude may ruin a good students with the infinite attractions.
1.0	However their always should be applause for the achievements they get in school.
1.0	The schoolarship is hard to get.
7.0	And if your children can have this kin
11.0	I agree with the opinion that the youth depended too much on their parents to make decisions for them before and today they can make decisions about themsevles better.
4.0	First, we all know that in the past, since the information are not accesssed so easily as today,adults have much more knowleage and experience than the youth which leads them to make decisions for the youth more often.
8.0	If you did not know about how far away from you and your destination, how could you choose the tranportation form exactly?
8.0	BUT your parents have more knowleage and experience and they might went to your destination before and they could lift very good plan on how to get there.
8.0	That's why teenagers have to search for their parents' helps in the past.
4.0	However, as time passed, the world changed.
8.0	We could easily get worldwide information on the intelnet and people's sharing on electronic media such as APP and website.
8.0	Nowadays, lots of young people have mumch more abroad eyesight than their parents since they are much more good at mastering new technique like electronic machines, which offers enormous information.
8.0	With these, the youth have enough resources to make their own decisions.
4.0	Furthermore, as the advancement of education system, teenagers are better educated which provide good supports for them to adapt their aptitude.
8.0	For example, usually the parents would decide what kind of work the children need to do after they grow up a hundred years ago.
8.0	If they decide to send their chidren into the painting studio, their childs would be expected to be a painter.
8.0	That's how Davenci became a painter.
8.0	But nowadays, since children are easily to access lots of information, they know themselves better and have their own interests very early.
12.0	There are parents who reaward their children for high scores on their school work.
11.0	In my opinion, it may not be a good idea to use money as the tool of awarding.
5.0	It is crucial to give encouragement once children have made progress in their class, which will act as incentives for children to keep making effort in learning.
8.0	But the implement of money may foster an impression on children that they are working hard only for financial remuneration.
8.0	Gradually, they may develop an abnormal life value that life is all about money but not other purposes such as love, harmonious family relationships, friends and so on.
8.0	I see this happened on my sister's 4-year-old child.
8.0	My sister thought it would be beneficial for child to try to manage their own money from a young age, so she awarded her daughter directly with money each time the little girl got praise from the teacher in kindergarten.
8.0	At the beginning my niece behaved just as well.
8.0	"But there was once my sister asked her to leave the TV and play games with her friends who came to visit her, she said like this, ""I'd like 5 yuan as a compensation to my time spent on playing with her, or I'd rather watching TV."""
8.0	It was so shocking to my sister that such a little girl could neglected her own friends so much just for money!
8.0	So I think it is not appropriate to use financial compensation as reward in terms of children, especially youngsters who are unable to determine what is important in their life.
5.0	Besides, giving children economical reward may also stimulate ill-natured comparison.
8.0	Children may show off their reward to others, which may lead to psychological unbalance.
8.0	Once children find out their peers get more money than they do for the same amount of progress, they may tend to ask their parents for more, which could exceed the parents affordability.
8.0	If the parents could not meet their demands, it may develop self-abasement in children for their family is not as rich as others'.
8.0	Gradually, this may lead children to develop characteristic pf low self-esteem, and this would be profoundly harmful to children in their mental-health development.
1.0	To summerise, I do not support the idea of adopting money as reward to children's scholar improvement since it may have bad consequences such as negative life values and low self-esteem.
1.0	Other approaches, such as more time spending with children, desirable presents, or simply taking children to museums or other amusement palces pleasuable to children are my recommendations.
12.0	Some people in the modern society may think that technoligical movies and novels can create us a more relaxing enviroment that is good for spending time with .
12.0	However , I have  different ideas.
12.0	It comes to the statement that people nowadays have a heavier workload with PCs or electronic products so they truly need physical exercises to relaxed themselves,I strongly agree.
11.0	There are two major reasons why I feel this way:physical exercises can lead a strong body,moreover ,residentsa are able to get more friendsship through it and acquire innner pleasure.
5.0	First of all , I believe that physical exercises help more with our body .
8.0	Many sit down in the offices ,concentrating  on the screens day by day for work .
8.0	When the after-work bell is rang ,they become busy with their smart phone to contact with the friends or games.
8.0	In reality ,one may not have time to relax their body because eyes are always in the working condition and body is only in chairs ,sofa or bed.
8.0	In this way ,sports is a better mediem ,through this ,people carry arms ,strech their legs to relaced themselvem and possess a hgealthy body.
5.0	Secondly,people spend more tinme communicationg with others face to face rather than sending a message so that they have a opportunity to release inside thought and feel more relaxed.
8.0	We cannot work all day long and leave no time for fun and  personal development .
8.0	AS for me ,after a day of work ,I usually choose to play table tennies with my friends and we playing as well as chatting ,such like problems i have met ,some quarrels with others .
8.0	SUprisingly ,among the communication, I feel more relaxed than being alone.
0.0	IN summery ,the introduction of the physical exercises are panacea to people of modern society.
0.0	For leisuse time becomes more and more valuable to all of us .
0.0	it seems more significant to exploit efficiently such like sports which brings stronger nodies and inner relaxed .
0.0	For these reasons ,It seems obvious to me that physical exerciuse are better than movies or books to mrelax one
11.0	I don't agree with that statement for the following reasons.
12.0	Above all, with the increasing donations with a story about someone who is in trouble because of kinds of accidents and need other's help, people become more and more apathy about the struggling strangers.
8.0	A investigation has been done asking people if they have to choice wheter to save their pet dogs or a stranger.
8.0	It's astound that most of answers are saving their pet dog.
8.0	Hence, it's easy to find out that people are less apt to reaching out for the unknowed strugglings.
6.0	What's worse, there are a lot of cheaters who want to cheat other and rake into money through people sympothy,making the socioty don't believe the true struggling strangers.
7.0	Nowadays, poeple dare not to help the elder who slde
12.0	In our daily life , we face pessure from all sides, including the work, the study and the family etc. so it is really necessary for us to relax.
11.0	Someone hold the belief that it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.
12.0	Is this opinion really tenable?
11.0	As far as i'm concerned, i don't think it's reasonable.
5.0	Fristly, doing physical exercise can help us release the pressure.
8.0	Doing exercise can distract one's attention from the subjects bringing him pressure, it helps you concentrate all your attention on the exercise.
8.0	Secondly, doing exercise can help you build a sound mind in a sound body.
8.0	Only if you have a healthy body will you lead a successful life.
8.0	Thridly, doing exercise can make you meet more people, make more friends who can help you solve your problem.
5.0	In a word, i think no matter watching a movie and reading a book or doing exercise, they all are good ways to relax.
7.0	In fact, different people have differrent tatse, there is no such a difference in which is worse or which is better, the best one is always the one that suits yo
3.0	Nowadays, many parents want their kids to get a good grades in the test  and they always do some methods to make it, some of them offer their kids money as a gift  for every high grade they gain in school.
11.0	In my opinion, I am convinced that it  can inspire their school-age children to make progress in each test.
11.0	However, parents can take this action as long as they   master properly.
11.0	It will be a good idea.
5.0	To begin with, school-age children can be more motivated in this way that their parents give money to them to reward them.
8.0	With this strong expectation appearing in their own minds, they will produce one motivated behavior to boost themselves to do better in theri study.
8.0	For instance, once I became less interested in English, and at that time I always got  bad grades in English tests.
8.0	In that case, my parents thought one fresh idea that can let me pick up the interest of this project is offering money as long as I get high mark in English test, which made me so excited that I could not wait to show my real ability about learning English.
8.0	From then on, I began to read English every morning and I just felt like every day I had countless power that could not use up forever.
8.0	Day by day, I got the highest English mark in my class, and there is no deying that I also gained money  first in such a  cool way.
5.0	In addition, I figure that this way can improve the relationship between parents and their own kids.
9.0	As you know, it is the time that children are easily quarrel with their parents because of many little things.
9.0	However, in this way, parents can get more chances to commmunicate with children through  rewarding money.
2.0	In conclusion, not only do children in school make progress, but also they can get on better with their parents at home.
3.0	In a highly competitive society, whewhter workers are more satisfied when thay have divers types of tasks to do during the workday than when they do similar tasks all day long has always been a heated debate.
3.0	Obviously, each approach has its merits and drawbacks.
3.0	the majority of people contend that concentration on one task should outweigh exploring diverse tasks.
11.0	However, as far as I am concerned, a versatile person has a greater chance of being sucessful in comparison with one merely dedicated to a specific task.
5.0	First and foremost, today's companies.
8.0	no matter giant multinational ones or small start-up tend to seek qualified candidates with multiple talents.
8.0	it is not rare to see that in the recruitment announcement of those company, versatility is favored and could contribute to a higher possibility od being hired.
8.0	On one hand, big company require employees to be not only excelled at their own professional, but also good at communication skills.
8.0	A good case in this point is Starbuck's barista is far from just making tasty espresso, but also should master good interpersonal skills with customers so that their services can be fully appreciated and ackonwledged by some picky coffee drinkers.
8.0	This example strongly demonstrate that works can benefit from the multitask as well as customers.
5.0	furthermore, different skills help broaden one's horizon and outlook, thus making a person more open-minded as well as cultivating a better self-awareness, both od which are essential to an enduring success.
8.0	For one thing, developing diverse abilities can help a person cultivate a brand new perspective which leads toa cpmprehensive mindest so that they can make their work  effiency and have a positive impression in his boss's mind.
8.0	it also good for one's promotion in a company.
8.0	For instance, my brother works in a big company, he is never complain about his busy work instead of working hard.
8.0	Once the tasks is arduous, besides there are only a limited time left for his.
8.0	he did noting but to do many diffrernt types of tasks simultaneously, eventually, he finish those tasks on time and gurantee the accuracy of tasks.
1.0	Admittedly, a person concentrating on a similar task is very likely to become a sophisticated person and miximize the rate of mistakes.
1.0	However, if the person does well in one aspect, he could  tour around the mation to deliver his discoveries, theories.
7.0	Undoubtedly, versatility enable
3.0	Today,how to make students achieve good grades arises peoples' thinking.
3.0	In that condition, some parents try to use the way of awarding to motivate their children.
12.0	From my perspective,awarding children's high grades with money is not a good ideas.
5.0	First,money can mislead children.
8.0	Study is a thing that we should continue with or without award.
8.0	Giving good students money may leave them an impression that study is a hard thing that should be repaid materially.
8.0	They may ignore the good mental effect brought by study.
8.0	Taking math studying as an example,without considering money students may try to find the beauty of math to gain happiness.
8.0	Study itself can help them find the true meaning of study.
8.0	While worrying about the money ,they may not enjoy the process and try to solve plenty of math questions to make sure their good grades.
8.0	In the end, they may get their money but they begin to take math as a thing that is hard to learn and is needed to be rewared.
5.0	Second,money given to children is hrad to controlled.
8.0	Students may begin to have bad habits with those money which may be harmful for their future.
8.0	For example,if a student use the money to buy a PSP and play all days.
8.0	It will cause him to ruin his future.
8.0	Students are young and they don't have the ability to make judgement themselves so giving them money is a risky thing .
1.0	There are a lot of things that is better than money to give to children .
1.0	For example ,you may send children books that contains the subjects they are most interested in.
3.0	Now days, more and more teachers like to show their own political views to their students.
11.0	Some people think that is a good way to let students learn some socializing skill, but some people believe that will have some bad influence on studences.
11.0	In my opinion, it dependent on the stituation.
5.0	On the one hand,  teachers should not express their own social or political views to students, because that will mislead the students.
8.0	In the students' age, they are building their own view and independent thinking about world.
8.0	In this period, they are very easy to be influenced.
8.0	For example, if the teacher is the a racist, he does not like any people with different color.
8.0	When he express his racism opinion to his students, students probably will be infect by this idea and also discriminate other races.
8.0	Even though they know nothing about other races.
8.0	Oppositely, if the teacher never shows his cocial views to other race people, the most of students will not be infludenced by the racial theory.
8.0	Students have not finish buliding their own independent thinking, so they can not tell what is right, what is wrong.
8.0	Teacher has authority in the class, thus students will be influenced easily by their teacher.
8.0	Therefore, if the teacher has some aggressive social or political view, they should not share his views to his students.
5.0	On the other hand, teahcers should teach some life lessons to his students according to his own social view.
8.0	Students have not build their own moral concept properly, so they need their teacher to lead them into a correct road.
8.0	For instance, if a boy steal a needle form the store, and his teacher know this thing.
8.0	The teacher should tell the boy, stealing is not fit moral and law, which is according to teacher's own social view.
8.0	As we know, young children does not have their own ability of jugement, so the teacher should use their own social views to correct the students' unethical  concept, which is in order to help the students to become useful to the society.
1.0	In conclusion, personally speaking ,I think sometime teacher should show their own social or political views to the students, but sometime they shouldn not.
1.0	It is depending on the situations.
3.0	As we advance to a new period, it is common for us to work in group rather than depending on personal force because team work is stronger and more effective than personal work.
3.0	Obviously, how to successfully manage team is highly important step in achieving group's goal.
3.0	For the means leaders to direct team, some people claim that leader should not listhen to the advice of team members because learders are people team members should respect.
3.0	However, I am in tune that leaders are supposed to listhen to the advice of the team members.
5.0	In the first place, some team members have abilities leader does not have; therefore, it is necessary for leaders to appraise advice of the team members.
8.0	For example, my father who is major in finance work in a computer company and his boss is major in computer science.
8.0	When company face some difficulty on analysing market and decide invistment direction, my father's leader must absorb his opinion and advice and he may make huge lost without the help from my father  because he has not any relative knowledge in economy.
8.0	This way, it is necessary for leaders to listen some professional advice in order to make some professinal decision, which will help them solve lots of problems.
5.0	Secondly,democrace is highly most important in a company, which will cemete all people.
8.0	For instance, when I work in an advertisement company, my boss never listhen to others' opinion and always persist do what he favor, which not only cause huge cost in company but also make lots of good employees can not find their value in work.
8.0	In this way, lots of employees who embrace mastery on advertisement work in other more democrate and fair company in order to make a splite.
8.0	Therefore, if  leaders is willing to make their company better, it is important to keep their talent employees in company.
8.0	Listening and applicating to their advice are good means to achieve this goal.
0.0	Finally, listening to the advice of the eam members can improve the personal ability of leaders.
0.0	For example,In the past I was a shy boy who had no breave to talk with others.
0.0	However, when I studied in university and managed basketball club, one of my followor suggested me that I should to communicate frequently with my team members and this will let me know others well.
0.0	I happilly accepted this advice and I always did this in my later leader job.
0.0	This ability not only help me to set up a good relationship with all of my members, but also communicate will with all people surrounding.
10.0	In this way, I never have trouble to make friends with others.
3.0	"As a saying goes"" different strokes for different folks""."
3.0	Some teenagers may consider their parents involve in their education too much, even overweigh the parents in the past.
3.0	And I totally endorse with those people's standpoint.
11.0	And I have several reasons to back up my opinion.
5.0	First, people in the past thought highly of food rather than education.
8.0	Since most family required more labors to make money rather than consume money, they prefered to let their kids to work rather than study.
8.0	Take my father as an example.
8.0	He was born in an underpriviledged family.
8.0	He needed to help his father cultivated or water those crops every day, so he had no time to go to school.
8.0	Moreover, his family rejected himself to accept formal accademic education because they had no extra money to pay for his tuition fee and books.
8.0	So my father could study only by borrow his neighbours' books.
8.0	However, parents nowadays stick to allow their kids to learn piano, have dancing class since they do not want them to left behind by other peers.
8.0	This can be achieved only in those welthy family in the past, but the condition is prevalent nowadays.
5.0	In addition, the degree of education is more important nowadays than that in the past.
8.0	Since many people who did not go to school can also success in the past, and now the competition is more fierce.
8.0	My father did not go to school and receive any formal education, but he became a successful bussinessman just through his presevarence.
8.0	Since the policy in his period offer lots of support for his entreperneur.
8.0	However, nowdays increasing people wanted to success, the policy could not support every entreperneur to success.
8.0	And most of people nowadays have high education level since the live improves a lot and more people can go to school.
8.0	Therefore, the standard that most companies required is higher than before.
8.0	Thus, it is difficult for people who have low level education to be achievement.
1.0	Granted, children in the past were more likely to obey their parents so parents can be more easily to involve their education.
1.0	However, most family prefer to allow their kids to take up a job rather than receive education since most family did not have the ability to afford it.
3.0	"Suffering traffic jum on road, some may ask, ""will there be fewer cars in twenty years?"""
3.0	"When confronted with such problem, my answer is difinitely ""nope."""
3.0	Instead, the number of cars in use, as far as I am concerned, will keep increasing.
11.0	The reasons will be discussed in the following paragraph.
4.0	First, people have been asking for more cars, and the need for cars is still rising.
8.0	People will be richer in twenty year and they need new cars to improve their life quality, which is obvious by comparing the different car use in China and America.
8.0	In America, One household owns at least one car, while there are still many workers in China who cannot afford the cost of a car for their family.
8.0	Besides China, other developing countries may have growing need for new cars, with their economic advance.
8.0	Nowadays, some people's desire for cars are restrained by their financial problems.
8.0	Once they can lead a better life in the future, they will try to take home their favorite cars.
4.0	Second, cars, supported by the technological progree, will be advanced to satisfy the life of people, which will contributes to the increading number of cars.
8.0	Compared with pasttimes, cars have much more functions.
8.0	To be more specific, cars were used to take place of horse or something like that.
8.0	In contrast, nowadays, cars are developed to have more functions.
8.0	Take the house car for example.
8.0	People cannot only use it to cover long distances, but also take it as their movable home.
8.0	During such journey, poeple can fulfill their dream of travelling around their country, or even the world.
4.0	Admittedly, cars are often rebuked to emit polluted gas, which is commutanious to our environment.
10.0	But these environmental problems related to cars can be sovled by our technological advance.
2.0	In a nutshell, I think there will be more car
3.0	Do you have a extended family?
3.0	Do you think extended family is universal in today's society?
3.0	And do you like extended family?
3.0	From my perspective, I contend that the extended family is less important now tham it was in the past, because the spciety changes a lot and a extended family will cause many promblems during the time getting along with them.
12.0	My specific reasons are mentioned below.
5.0	Today's society is not more busy than before we do not have enough time to take care of all the family manbers, so a extended family is not such important.
8.0	Take my own family as an example.
8.0	Before I came to this world, my family is an extended family.
8.0	They lived in the countryside and felt happy.
8.0	Conversly, in recent decades, all the family menbers lived together, but some promblems showed up gradualy.
8.0	For instance, my grandfather felt very tired to cook meals for such peoples.
8.0	And my grandmothers felt very difficult to help lots of people wash their clothes.
8.0	And also, my mother and her cousins felt very busy in helping each other and take care of each other.
8.0	Thus, my family choose to live seperately, which means they all live with their own family in different places and the extended family become small.
8.0	And now , they live in different cities successfully and more confortable than before, because they do not need to spare too much time to take care of other family menbers.
8.0	Therefore, the extended familly is less important than before.
5.0	And to having a extended family is imppossible in today's society except living in the countryside.
8.0	People all choose to live in the coties, some substabtial things cannot hold such a big family.
8.0	Take the house as an example, if we have a extended famly, we need a big house to hold a bounch of people, but this cannot achieve in the cities.
8.0	Because of the firece marketing, only few people can afford a big house, so the extended family is less important in today's society.
8.0	Conversly, a big house is universe in the rural areas where people live in the past.
8.0	Thus, the extended family need to face thousands of problems, so people will try to avoid extended family and gradualy it become less sinificant than before.
1.0	Actually, the extended family is commom in the past time, but with the time going by, extended family is become less essential, because family menbers have to deal with many problems, which is really waste their time in such a time-consuming society.
1.0	Charishing the time become more important than be
3.0	I  think nowdays people are more willing to help strangers than before .
3.0	In recent years I have participted in the activites of poblic interest organization to donate poor mountain children .
3.0	And many friends also take part in different donations activities.
3.0	Changers of indivadual contributions show the extent of people s readiness to help strangers .
3.0	China char repority report also now show a  cibil socilty .
11.0	But it is enough to show people are more media reports of uch incidents.
8.0	One of the most let I toyched was a chridren .
8.0	All of these children are come from HIVinfected families but,with time past the vounlteers save almost enough money to help them to get batter life and the money is from strangers.
8.0	These all money are from Internet and people donated not only their money ,but also their love to these children who get HIV and show their love to this social world.
6.0	Times flies ,its not 19 cnetury anymore people can commuicate with each more convient and more often.
8.0	We are not only feel strange when we use Internet ,I blieve their will be more love and warm.
8.0	We wont feel cold anymore.
8.0	I think the world will become better no more lies but more warm .
8.0	We have to admit that people full of kindenss are become more and more .
1.0	All in all ,I think that people,will get more trust, warm, kindness ,instead of lie ,cold ,strange.
1.0	That also why people want to help strangers and more people will join these people to help strangers/.
12.0	I think hard study is one of the most basic elements a man should posses if he want to get success in a future job.
12.0	It is no doubt that studying hard in school is more important than social skills.
12.0	Having a extraudinary professional literacy is very necessary to get good grade in a future job.
12.0	meanwhile,we can only hosting our profession capacity by study hard.
6.0	First of all, we can learn many professional knowledge which will be used in our future job.
8.0	some might be quite difficlut to understand thoroughly, so that we have to study hard to grasp them.
8.0	for example, the jobs of the internet industry, of the financial fileds , or the ones of the electronic products industry.
8.0	they all need  to take an effort to master.
10.0	Different ways of Relaxing
3.0	With the fast development of current world,people live in present society are facing much more problems and stress.
3.0	Many people may feel tired sometimes when under pressure.
12.0	Thus,having a relax occasionally is important.
12.0	Here goes a statement holding that it's better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physcial exercise,which I don't agree with.
6.0	there are some reasons can demonstrate my opinion.
8.0	Firstly,it is widely considered that when you feel tired,there is a special condition that your body isn't tired,but you just don't want to do the things you are doing anymore.
8.0	This is called mental weariness.
8.0	Under this circumstance,what you need is just stop doing the current thing and turn to try another.
8.0	That is to say,having a relax doesn't mean stay in coach doing nothing,which may makes you feel more tired.
8.0	Secondly,medical specialists have demonstrated that aerobic
11.0	Some people in society think that people today are not more willing to help the struggling strangers.
12.0	However i have a different idea.
11.0	When it comes to statement that people today are more willing to help the struggling strangers, i strongly agree.
11.0	There are some reasons why i feel this way:todays high level education and enormous economic condition.
4.0	Firstly, following the fast develop of society more and more people access the high level education.
8.0	They have more benevolence than before.
8.0	When they meet people who need help they will pay for the time and patient to help the people even if strangers.
8.0	Because they konw if every one would like to do it the world will be better.
8.0	Like my brother, he will donate his pin money to help the poor people.
8.0	I still remember twenty years ago, in my city a large number of people can not help the poor people and even laugh them.
8.0	Because they did not go to the school to receive the education.
4.0	secondly, the family have more income than before.
8.0	They will donate a part of money to help the people who really need some money to creat the company or career.
8.0	Because when they want to set up company or use themselves skills to contribut the society they have not enough money so they have to give up.
8.0	They have not want miss any talented person.
8.0	So they will help them.
4.0	Admittedly, nowadays a lot of people are not help the struggling stranges because these people can not bring any profit to them.
10.0	But this situation will be solved because the government enforce the some department to appeal people should hlep the struggling strangers.
1.0	Taking into account all the factors mentioned above, we may safely arrive at the conclution people today are more willing to help the struggling strangers.
1.0	Not only have high level education but also have enormous economic condition.
3.0	From my personal perspective,I don't think it's a good idea.
11.0	I must say I competely disagree this behavior.
11.0	Firstly,on the children's view,gardes belong to you own,only you yourself can know what your level is.
11.0	When you graduate,and when you come into the society,no one will do you a favor and on one help you.
11.0	What you will get is what you must pay.
11.0	You,yourself,should struggle for a better future for yourself.
9.0	It's impossible that parents will acompany you for a whole life,you must learn to do everything on your own.
9.0	All of you are like little birds that will fly themselves one day sonner or later.
6.0	Secondly,on the parents' view.
8.0	I's like to ask those parents who offer schools money for high grade of your own children.
8.0	You realy think it's benifical to your children?
8.0	If you think so,I want to tell all of you that you are totally wrong!
8.0	If you do this,you are not good parents.
8.0	However,you are hurting him!
8.0	Your spoiling makes your own children go into a 'safe' zone.
8.0	In this zone,they lose the ability of independent,they will think all of the world is they are deseverd and whatever they want is always someting that somebody will do it for them.
1.0	Everthing has its two sides.
1.0	Like anything else,this thing also has its two side.
8.0	Parents do this for me,doubtedly,it looks that we are really good.
8.0	But,as a matter of fact,we are not like what we look like.
8.0	As a consequence of all these shortcomings mentioned above,my own opinion about this thing is I totally diagree.
8.0	I myself encouage all parents to let your children learn something single,do something single,cult
3.0	At present, a controversial topice has  aroused a heated debete among students: are workers more satisfied when they have many different kinds of tasks to do duting the working hours than whe they do similai jobs all the time.
3.0	Answers vary from one to another.
3.0	Some people clains that repeating the same tasks will be conducive to the workers.
3.0	However, contrary to their views comes my own perspective that workers will be more pleased when they do different types of the jobs.
12.0	My viewpoint is based on the following points.
5.0	First, doing different types of tasks can increase workers' work efficiency, which is relation to their satisfaction.
8.0	To be more specific, the worker won't get bored easily if they are assigned to various kind s of jobs.
8.0	For their attention is highly focused on the tasks, their work efficieny will be raised unconsciously.
8.0	And then chances are that there is some exta time left after finishing all the jobs and workers will feel a sense of achievement and satisfaction.
8.0	However, if they repeat doing the same thing for constantly 8 hours, they will distract attention from the task and then cannot finish the assignment on time, resulting that the boss might be unpleasant to their work performence and then they will also get upset.
8.0	For example, I once washed the dishes as my part-time job in a restaurant in summer vacation.
8.0	I just repeated the same action all the time and then I felt distracted and suddenly I broke up nearly all the dishes.
8.0	As a result, I was required to use my salary to make up for the dishes.
8.0	If I worked as a cook, it would be totally different for I need to make different kinds of dishes and I wouldn't be  distracted！
5.0	Second, handling various types of jobs can also perfect their working ability, which will make employees more satisfied .
8.0	Specifically, dealing with different types of work requires people to have the ability of multi-task, which means they need to handle a lot of tasks at the same time and possess the ability to tackle tha changes which might happen anytime.
8.0	In the way, the working ability will be improved and people will finally make progress in their work performence, However, if people do similar tasks all day long, they are more likely to be accustomed to this comfortable atmospehere and won't do  any positive changes in their work.
8.0	So how could they make improvement in their working ability?
8.0	Take my uncle as an example .
8.0	He works in a big Internet company.
8.0	Everyday he needs to deal with different  kinds of the tasks such as fixing the bugs, make some optimization and compile some computer programs to meet differnet requirement of his employers.
8.0	Under this circumstance, he is more and more skillful in his field and his excellent working ability makes him stand out and my uncle finally gets promotion.
1.0	In conclusion, the workers will more satisfied when they deal with differen types of work durin the workday for it could not only elevate their working efficiency but also perfecr their work ability, which will be helpful for their career development.
1.0	In this way, they will more pleased and satisfied about their work performance.
3.0	Since it is highly expected that students can get perfect marks in their examination, parents have tried many strategies to encourage their children to be engaged in their studies.
3.0	As you can imagine, a vast number of parents give money to their children as a reward for their dilligence because children seems to have many options to make use of money received.
3.0	Actually, I think it is kind of ridiculous to form a close connection between schoolwork and money.
12.0	It will eventuallyaffect children's in the future in the following aspects.
5.0	First off, we are supposed to claim clearly that students don't study for money, just like adults never lead their lives aiming at earning more money.
8.0	Money can benefit us in a variety of ways, so can it destroy us.
8.0	If children form a firm opinion that money is the most valuable substance they can't gain from success, they will not plan their future careers which they find exciting and enjoyable.
8.0	During the period of war, many soldiers gained wealth and social status because of their distinguished accomplishment.
8.0	When they rewarded their kids, they often gave them money just as what government did to them.
8.0	When their children grew up, they became to form the poin t of view that everything they did was for money.
8.0	They didn't care about what job they got, since they could got money, but they were not happy towards their lifesyle.
8.0	They eventually got dipressed and became absorbed to alcohol.
5.0	Furthermore, students can't manage money in a proper way when they are at their formative year.
8.0	The reward of their parents which contained some much money will lead to the abusive use of money, which is an unavoidable trend.
8.0	My friend always use money to buy video games and comic books, which affects his study significantly.
8.0	"This is not his fault, but his parents' mistake that makes him a ""bad boy""."
2.0	In conclusion, we should prevent offering money as a reward for children's high grades, considering the effects it leads to their future career and their habit.
3.0	With the development of the world, almost all the families have a better living standard then before.
3.0	So in some families, when their school-age students get a high grade in scool, these parents will offer their children money.
11.0	Some people don't think that is a good way to encourage their kids, but in my opinion, I think that is a good way to let their childern become more better.
5.0	Firstly, their children can use these money to buy something they wants.
8.0	that is better for kids buy things themselives than their parents bought them directly.
8.0	I still remember when I was a primary school students, I wanted a  beautiful pen very much.
8.0	I told to my parents and wanted them buy it to me, but they refused.
8.0	They told me that if I can get a high grade in the next math exam, they will offer me some monwy and I can control the money myself.
8.0	So I used my best effot to overcome my weakness and learned math, I wake up one hour early at morning to do that complex math queations.
8.0	After a long period of time, My grade improve a lot.
8.0	I will always remember the pretty pen  I bought with my own effort, that's more meaningful than my parents bought me directly.
8.0	So in this case, I think it is a good way to offer children money as a prise.
5.0	Secondly, if we have money when we have a high scores, we will have more motive power to have a good grade.
8.0	Otherwise we may get tired about the bored study.
8.0	I still remember I have a teacher who have a high educational attainments,she told us that when she was a little girl, she was not willing to hardworking, but her parents always use different method to encouraged her, like money.
8.0	Then she gradually observed that study is a interesting thing, and finally she became very successful in her grades.
8.0	So in this story,  I think that is a good method to encoursge their children to have  a high scores.
10.0	Admittedly, some people may think these money will let their children become more and more vulgar, that is acctually a problem, but if we use optimal ways to give kids money like a small number one time, it will solve this problem.
2.0	All in all,  if sll the people use money and have a optimal way to let their children love in study, that will let our children become more greater and boost their potential power.
3.0	In such a rapidly developing society, people attach more and more attention to their children's education.
3.0	Now they care about the children's grade very much.
3.0	Some parents offer their children money for each high gread or mark they get in school.
3.0	Others think this method is not proper.
3.0	If i were a parent who has a school-age children, I would not take this method.
12.0	Here are my reasons.
5.0	Firstly, children may cheat in tests in order to obtain more money from their parents.
8.0	As we all know, honesty overweigh high grades.
8.0	However, for children who are too young to understand moral pricipals deeply, the temptation of money may lead then to cheat.
8.0	One of my cousins used to ask his parents for money when he get good greads in school.
8.0	At the begining, he left no effort to do the best.
8.0	However, he got tired over a period.
8.0	Wanting to please his parents and get the money, he cheat in tests.
8.0	In my opinion, offering money for high grade may lead bad behaviors like this.
5.0	Secondly, when children grow up, they will lose the motivation of getting high grade in furder study.
10.0	Because there is no more money offered by their parents or other people, the grown children may be unconfortable and lose their goal.
2.0	These are the reasons that I don't think the method is a good idea for children's development.
3.0	I disagree with the following statement.
12.0	To begin with, prople today are more busy then before.
12.0	So we don't have time to help the strangers when we walk on the street.
8.0	Secondly, people don't believe in each other because many of us have the experience of be cheated.
8.0	For example, when someone walk on the street, some stange poor guys will ask you for your money or some food, but actualy they are not poor, or when you are driving on the road, a men fall in front of your car and said that he is hurted by you but you did't.
8.0	Because of these story, people became less willing to help stanges because they are not sure the strangers are truely in troubles or not.
6.0	In the end , sometimes helping strangers might bring us danger.
8.0	This is true when experiencing natual disasters.
8.0	People have the instinct to protect themself over help others.
8.0	I believe that this is not of lower moral standard , but the nature human being.
3.0	The influence of celebrities is more and more important for all people in the world with the raipd development of internet.
11.0	The influence of  opinion of the celebrities is important to whom already produce the sevece debate.
11.0	And in my opinion, the opinion of celebrities has a more influence on the younger people.
5.0	First of all, the younger people have more contract with the fashinal trends of celebrities, so they will be influenced by famous people.
8.0	With the popular of computer, younger people who like concerning the famous people can easily use the internet to learn the news obout celebrities around the world.
8.0	Because the younger people use more the new and advanced technology than older people and the younger is likely to copy with the celebrities, so the opinion of celebrities will be more important to younger people.
8.0	For example, my  brother offen read the article of Mayun, a successf And addition, the younger have more need to study the opinion of the celebrities to find the way to success in the future.
8.0	Because the younger people will face the difficult of study and finding a well-paid job, and they just start the their future career.
8.0	Younger people have more time and effort to make the differce in the society.
8.0	As a result, the opinion of the celebrities is very important to younger people in their future life.
5.0	Additimedly, the older pepole also need the opinion of the celebrities, but they can't make use up the value of the opinion, brecause the older people have much their life experience which they faced with in the past by theirselves.
9.0	they actually need't the opinion of the celebrities as younger people.
9.0	The younger people can have a fully use of the value of the vies of the famous people.
2.0	To a conclusion, the influence of the opinion of the celebrities is more important on the younger pepole because they will use the wisdom and the successful experience to make their dream into the truth earily.
7.0	And they can make a difference in the society to benefit our world and achieve someing amazing
3.0	Making a decision seems like a difficult thing for a young people.
3.0	Most youngsters tend to let their parents help them to make a decision in the past.
12.0	But nowadays, more and more young people do not need their parents to partcipate their decisions about their own lives.
9.0	I really agree with the statement.
9.0	Teenagers have already had their own thinking about the decisions they made.
6.0	Firstly, current teenagers are more independent of their parents than young people in the past.
8.0	They do not depend on their parents and their parents do not accompany them in the school.
8.0	For instance, when a student goes to school taken by his parents, his parents will leave him and let he contacts with teachers and classmates by himself.
8.0	During the process, he need to learn what kind of friends he can make or what things he will deal with.
8.0	It is a big decison for himself.
12.0	Nowadays, many works explain their feeling about their salaries, and many employee thinks if they can not get satisfying salaries their work efficiency will become lower.
12.0	I think teacher is also like this situation, more salaries can trend them glad to work.
11.0	I think is universities spend more noney on salaries for professors, the quality if education will improved.
4.0	First, if uniiveristies give more salaries to teachers they will more glad to teach students.
8.0	LIke if the professor does not get enough salaries they would think why  I work so hard, it does not worth me to treat this very significance.
8.0	But, if the professor gets more salaries, he or she will think I need to work harder, and show the boss, I am a valuable person.
8.0	so, if the salaries of theachers higher, the quality of education will becomes higher.
4.0	Socend, more salaries can  help teachers to solve many economic problems, and they will more concentrate on their own work.
8.0	For instance, there was teacher in china, his wife got illness, but the medical payments were extramely expensive, he had no ablity to payit.
8.0	He bigan to worry about this incident, he did concentrate on the class, the quality of eduaction became terrible.
8.0	All the studens' grades lower than before.
8.0	Therefore, if salaries of this teacher was higher, the quality of education would not be affected so much.
4.0	Fianlly, if universitied spend more moeny on professors' salaries.
8.0	There will be more people glad to take part in this school, and unversites can gets more smart teachers.
8.0	For instacne, if school would like to spend more money, people will glad to go which place can give them best and highest benifits.
8.0	So,only school pay enough money, more talented people will come to school.
8.0	Then, high education backgroud teacher can teach more talend students.
0.0	In conclude,if unversities glad to spend more money on professors' salaries, the quality od education will improve more.
0.0	High salaries can let teacher glad to teach.
0.0	It can help teacher solves some problems.
0.0	And it also can get more high background teachers.
3.0	Teachers, a symbol of devotion, play an important role in our modern society.
3.0	It's no doubt that if there is no teacher on this planet, human beings cannot achieve wonderful achievements nowadays.
3.0	However, the attention on the salary of teachers has never come to an end.
3.0	Some people think the teachers should be paid as much as doctors, lawyers or bussiness leaders are paid but the others don't think so.
11.0	As far as I am concerned, I am in favor of the former opinion.
12.0	Here are some reasons to support my view.
5.0	First, teachers devote so much time to their career and spare no effort to teach students.
8.0	As we know, a teacher usually  teach several classes' students and take the responsibility to check the homework and so on, which is a giant and hard work.
8.0	These efforts teachers devote deserve a well-paid.
8.0	For example, my uncle teaches in a high school in our town.
8.0	He not only try his best to make his lessons more interesting and knowledgeable to benefit the students, but also uses his spare time to help students to have a better understanding on the subjects.
8.0	He often work so late in the evening until no one is awake except himself.
8.0	While his earnings is much lower than my aunt working as a doctor.
5.0	Second, the career teachers work on is one of the most great in this world.
8.0	It's universally acknowledged that the teachers  play a role of passing the most precious treasure, the knowledge, between generations.
8.0	This career make the human civilazation continue from the ancient days to today.
8.0	This is a respectable career that we should attach great importance to.
8.0	A well-paid salary will encourage teachers to make this career more and more flourishing.
8.0	For instance, once my school wanted to improve our grades.
8.0	But after many attempts, there was no work at all.
8.0	Then the principle decided to improve the salary of teachers to hope for a miracle.
8.0	It did work.
3.0	In my opinion,I disagree this statement.
3.0	First,watching a movie,reading a book or doing physical is just a kind of way to relax.
3.0	It depends on diffreent people with different interests.
3.0	Some people like to watching a movie because in this way he can forget many unhappy things or pression in work.
11.0	However,for other people,they may fell reading a book can be more meaningful.
10.0	And for others,doing some physical exersice is the best choice.
5.0	Second,it depends on different things people were doing before.
10.0	For instance,if a person has been reading books for an intire morning,doing some exercise can make him feel more comfortable and doing exercises can make an significant effect on relaxing himself.
5.0	Third,phsical exercise is nessary for a health life.
8.0	Chosing an apporpriate time to do some exercise is a good life style.
8.0	So,there is no meaning to discuss which way is better or not.
8.0	Because it depends on many factors.
8.0	What we should do is to choose the one sutiable for ourselves and continue to do it .
8.0	No matter watching a movie and reading a book or doing some physical exercises ,it will be good for our bodies in some conditions as well as dose harm to ourselves.
3.0	In such a highly competitive society, people are paying an increase amount of attention to how to improve work efficency.
3.0	When it comes to the statements that students work together or students work alone is better to learn much more effectively.
3.0	People usually exhibit an air of uncertainty.
12.0	However, in my opinoin, I think that students work together can learn much more effectively than students alone on projects.
5.0	First of all, students work together can discuss with each other and help each other, when students meet some diffculties, they can talk about this trouble and solve this problem together.
8.0	This way can improve work efficiency and learn more experience.
8.0	For example, the teacher lets us to design a research and do this research.
8.0	The teacher says that we can form a team or alone do it.
8.0	I organize a group with other three classmates.
8.0	We have a clear division of labor.
8.0	When we suffer form some problems, we will get together  and talk about it and slove it.
8.0	We save a lot of time to do other things, such as design, write and print.
8.0	We only spend two days to do these work.
8.0	We are the fastest finish this project in my class.
5.0	Second,
2.0	Judging from all the evidence offered, we may safely arrive at the conclusion that  students work together can learn much more effectively than students alone on projects.
12.0	I think doing physical exersize is a better way to realax.
11.0	There are 2 reasons.
12.0	First of all, when we exercise, we are not only relaxing our body, but also our mind, we can just relax, just runing or jumping or swiming,just exercising.
12.0	Scondly,watching movies or reading books arebadfor your eyes.
8.0	If you staying home all day long withourt doing exercise, your body will be really weak, you will get sick easily, because your body can just work will under the tempreture inside your house.
8.0	For example, I have got a very bad experense last year, i played the computer games all the summer, with air conditioner, plenty of food, but exercise.
8.0	Then, in the summer, i caught a realy bad cold.
8.0	We really needs exersise.
7.0	I thinkdoing physical exersize is a better way to realax both your mind and your bo
3.0	Nowadays, the social medias have become more and more popular and many famous people have their own blogs or twitters and they usually post their opinions through the social medias.
3.0	They have huge influences on the sociaty.
11.0	Some people argue that the opinion of these famous people is crucial to the younger people rather than the old ones.
11.0	In my opinion, I totally agree with it.
5.0	To begin with, there are more chances for the younger people to know these celebrities' opinions and thoughts than the old people.
8.0	Without doubts, younger ones are the majority of the phones users, they can follow their favourite people on the social medias and thus can get their idols' opinion conviniently.
8.0	When they see the celebrities' opinions every day, the thoughts will absolutely have a great impact on the young followers.
8.0	By contrast, old people absorb the information mainly from the newspaper or televisions, so they are less likely to get the thoughts from the celebrities.
8.0	Imagine, how chould things be important to somebody when somebody does not even know them?
5.0	Further more, younger people are usually at the stage of building their vision to this world, the celebrities' thoughts,opinions and how do they think about these world can helps these young people a lot.
8.0	They may also learn some good personalites from them, like to be humble, friendly and honest.
8.0	In another words, theses important opinions guide the young people--they play a key role in the stage of growing--which cannot be replaced even by their parents.
8.0	On the other hand, the old people's minds have been built already, the ways they see the world will not change too much.
8.0	They are pretty mature, so I don't think the thoughts would help them much.
2.0	So I think these opinoins are more improtant to young people than old ones
3.0	I disagree with the statment.
3.0	Relax onself that can give person a good scets and a better station,no matter what style .
12.0	Watching a movie can make we undergo that others experience,whatsoever careers or vacations.
12.0	Movie which is a art of motions and pictures,let the ciclestands so real and accessible,that other arts can't supply.
5.0	"""Books are the ladders that make people go up"",which said by a saint,and I agree whith this very much."
9.0	Reading is another relax mean and a effcientive mean.
9.0	We can understand many different idears and points,which expand our sight and bring broad world.
5.0	But ,body is the foundation of all above things.
8.0	Doing physical esercise can make you strong enough that ills will never come and you can do work enthusiatic easily.
8.0	Otherwise,we may clear out though and remove the bad material from our body when doing physical exercise ,that can relax the heart thoulgh tired the body.
8.0	Thus ,it is a good relax method.
2.0	So,if you want to telax,you can slect any way what you want or what you perfer.
10.0	One thing that we must remember is relax you heart is more importent than anything.
3.0	I disagree with the following statement.
12.0	In these years, many researcher has to shown about to do exercises can help amount of people for their healt and it can also to let them to keep a good healthy body aeven mind.
11.0	However the other peopleuse all excuses about reasons to why they can lead their own life.
11.0	About this statement, I chose to do physical exercise.
6.0	Firstly, doing more exercises about physical will have more benifit about your processes.
8.0	It can let you know more about things.
8.0	To watch moives or reading a book also can let your body relax, these can only realx your body.
8.0	Increasing people's body become badly, for example the high blood pressure, they should not always be stay one place to keep along time, also it not means to realx, only way they can chose to do physical exercises to process a healther body by healthier activities like jogging, mountain climbing more useful to stay place all the time.
10.0	secondly,
11.0	When it comes to the issue whether it's a good idea that some parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade or mark they get in school,I should say that I can't agree more with the practice.
11.0	The reasons are as following.
4.0	Firstly, rewards for high grade can undoubtedly provide encouragement and inspirtion for children to go all out in order to acquire better accomplishment.
8.0	Take myself for example.
8.0	Once, my father promised that as long as I can reach the top of my class, he would give me a luckypaper, which excited me to great degree.
8.0	I reached the paek of my study with the passion I acquired from my father's promise.
8.0	Consequencely, we can safely draw the conclusion that proper money reward can promote children's motivation.
4.0	Second, material rewards can further children's study.
9.0	With the money they acquire they are provided the right to choose their own mathod of studying, which expanding their range of flexible chioce.
9.0	They are able to adjust their way to study according to their own personalities and characters.
4.0	Last but not least, children ubderstand the ture meaning of laber and harvest through their strive for rewards, which hence can make them not only cherish their life today, but also appreciate their parents' hard work.
10.0	The plersure children acquire from the exchange offers them the concept of fair trade, contributing to their willingness to try new things.
2.0	Above all, we reach the point that the proper rewards are of really great benefit.
3.0	Recently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people:whether teacher should have the same salary as doctors, lawyers or business leader.
3.0	Opinions vary from people to people.
3.0	Some claim that there is no reason that teacher should have so much wage.
12.0	As for me, I wholeheartedly agree that teachers are supposed to be paid with the same salary as doctors'.
12.0	My points can be elaborated as followed.
5.0	First of all, teachers are so hard that they should accept the equivalent  salary.
8.0	As we all know, teaching profession means tranport the knowledge from the textbooks to the minds of children who are always too naive to understand what teachers talk in the class.
8.0	Because students' cognitive ablities cannot support them to really absorb the knowledge or observe the rules in the school, teachers often need to teach them the same knowledge by different ways or repeat to tell the students why they need to be quiet in the class, which is really boring and suffering for everyone.
8.0	For example, when I was ten years old, I have a English teacher named Jane.
8.0	I did really poor in the learing of English grammer, so Jane always allowed me to come to her office after school, and gave me extra lessons about grammer.
8.0	However, the difference between subject and verb always confused me, and Jane spent about two hours helping me slove such a easy problem.
5.0	In addition, much money can motivate teather to have a better condition to teacher students.
8.0	As we all know, we would be very happy if we have much more money than before.
8.0	So when the salary of teachers increase, teachers would be more energetic to face this job.
8.0	On the contrary, if teachers have little moeny to support their life, who can have the confidence to take their job or their students seriously.
8.0	For example, my cousin Jack is a Maths teacher, he used to felt hopeless about his job because his salary cannot afford his expense of life.
8.0	However, after the school increase his salary, he feel confident about thi, and the students' grades also higer than before/
2.0	To be include, teachers should have the same salary as high as doctors' salary.
11.0	Noadays, a good job is for everyone is very important, a good job can make people fell more satisfied.
12.0	And also a good evioment is also very importhat for workers.
12.0	There have a lot of different work ways, such as do many different types and do similar tasks all day long.
12.0	Many people think do similar task is more efficiently than do differemt types of tasks.
12.0	But l have different ideal, l think work diffenrent types of tasks is better than work similar task, because it l can learn a lot of skills and also l can make a lot of friends.
6.0	First, work differents work can make me learn a lot of skills, work a diferent tasks it the open my mind, because in the social a good job is alway very competition, if l have a lot of skills and a good views the conpany will first considering me.
10.0	For eaxmple, this year my brother go to find a job, he is a tennis coach also he want to become a coach, finally he work in a gym clube he can do a differents work, such as tennis, football and swinming coach, he tall me it is very intresting, because he can known about different fied, and also this experment will help he opend mind.
7.0	Second, work differents work can make us to make a lot of various friends, as we know when we doing a different work we wiil make some new friend, because we need disccuss some work problem, if we work similar work is alway very briong
7.0	and also we don't have have chanse to make some new friends, so l think work different work can widely make some friend and also w
12.0	As we know, the Internet must be one of the most greatest inventions in the 20th century.
12.0	In my opinion, it goes without saying that the Internet provides people with a lot of valuable information.
5.0	On the one hand, the Internet can offer us a lot of information about the things which is taking place all over the world without traveling.
8.0	It is a low cost but high-reward event that you can get the enough knowlege to expend your horizons without going anywhere.
8.0	For example, I can get the information about the war in the Middle East or who use the virtal reality technology on some industry applications by surfing on the Internet, and in this way I will realize how kind life we owe and how to find the way making a better life.
8.0	What's more, everyone can express their ideas on these events which can help us know the truth clearly.
8.0	From the differnt perspectives, we can improve our critical thinking.
5.0	On the other hand, we can learn some skills we need ro we like.
8.0	These skills can be useful which can help us got the job we want, gain more money or keep healthy.
8.0	Not everyone have the chance to get a good education, especially in some poor areas, but the Internet gives them the chance to get a better education, to learn some basic skiils which can let them have access to a better living conditions.
8.0	So in this way, Internet can benefits our lives.
3.0	Recently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people: which is more essential, success or keep happy and optimistic when we fail?
3.0	Opinions vary from person to person.
3.0	Some people claim that the success is more vital.
3.0	However, I would stand on their opposite side and I believe that it is more significant to stay optimistic and happy when we fail.
12.0	My viewpoints can be elaborated as follows.
5.0	Firstly, keeping happy and optimistic when we fail can shape our personality.
8.0	Only if we face to the failure bravely, can we recognize our shortcomings and recover them.
8.0	The happier we remain when we fail, the stronger we could become.
8.0	Success is much easier than staying an optimistic attitude when we fail.
8.0	Everyone has both of their success and failure, thus standing up after we fall down is more great than success.
8.0	For example, my sister was a clever girl and she often got first prize in her class.
8.0	All of my family were proud of her and decided to send her to The Second Middle School which was the best middle school in Wuhan.
8.0	However, she failed in her first exam in The Second Middle School and she losed her heart and cried.
8.0	She was so upset that she cannot concentrate on class, and she went back to her previous school eventually.
5.0	Secondly, staying happy and optimistic when we fail can cultivate a mind that never give up.
8.0	Many people would feel happy when they succeed, and not everyone can stay happy when we fail.
8.0	Optimistic attitude means that we should not be afraid of failure.
8.0	We would try again and never give up.
8.0	Once we are not afraid of failure, we would become closer to the success and we would not fear anything.
8.0	For example, I started to play the piano when I was six years old and I felt very bored when I practiced it.
8.0	I never give up it and encourage myself to become optimistic even If I fail in the piano contests.
8.0	However, I was admitted to the Wuhan Controversary Of Music three years ago.
1.0	All in all, I firmly think it is more important to stay optimistic and happ when we fail.
1.0	It not only can shape our personality bu also can cultivate a mind that never give up.
3.0	I don't think that its a good idea for parents to offer their school-age children money for each grade they get in school.
3.0	I have four reasons for this.
12.0	First, offering them money for high grade can confuse them that why do they work hard.
12.0	Parents' taking money as a prize for good grade is telling children that you are working for us rather than yourself.
12.0	Gradually, they'll be used to this kind of mode and form a strong idea that they are forced to work hard rathwer than work for themselves.
5.0	Second, this behavior is unbenificial to children's personality.
9.0	A child who always recieves money as a prize for good grade will value money too much and regards money as a precious thing.
9.0	They may lbe used to using money to solve every difficulty they ecounter and using money to thank for other people's help.
5.0	Third, using money as a prize for children who get high grade may create great burden for parents.
8.0	As children grow older, their demand for thier prize can grow.
8.0	Fourth, this can also do harm to the relatiomnship between parents and children, for they don't know how to praise and love each other except giving and recieving money.
8.0	My parents always use praisement to celebrate my high grade and comfort me with thier own stories when I get not so good grade, which makes me grow up in love and happines.
8.0	This also tells me that it all depends on me whether I should work hard or not, which means that I need to be responsible to myself.
8.0	Growing up in such a enviroment, I know how to be responsible to my life and how to use love to come along with my friends.
2.0	Therefore, I disagree to offer school-age children money for each high grade they get in school, which is harmful to their study career, personality and family relationship.
3.0	As children growing up, many problem should be faced by them.
3.0	Job become one of the most important problem, which have influence to both parents and children.
3.0	Choosing relative work with parents could get same topic with family about the work.
11.0	But choosing different area's job could be more free.
10.0	As for me, I think the first one is a good choose.
4.0	First and foremost, same jobs could share experience with parents.
8.0	As parents worked long before, therefore, they have many experience though the time-long work.
8.0	Children could get guild immediately when they meet problem if they ask parents for guild.
8.0	This could be more efficient in work rather than spending lot of time to look for help in the Internet.
4.0	Besides, relevent work could make family more relax by share work when one was very busy.
8.0	Knowing the knowledge then help other do work is possible.
8.0	One of my firends, their family always share work with other.
8.0	By doing this they get more time to play outside, doing sports and so on.
4.0	Last but not the least, it is easy to find a inheritor to run the things parents doing.
8.0	As for one of my classmates.
8.0	His parents were architects, and his job was to design the building.
8.0	Therefore, his parents think if they would not work, they could let he to herit the company.
8.0	In this case, the benifit of choosing ralevent jobs is obvisely.
2.0	Above all, I take the believe that it is better to choose the relevent jobs with parents
3.0	I agree with this statement, here are the reasons.
3.0	Firstly, in the future, people may use collective cars or other transportations.
3.0	Now, there are already sharing bikes, collective motos and  cars appeared.
3.0	This means that our country or even the whole world are trying to save the resouses by promoting people use sharing things---not everybody needs to buy a car.
3.0	Also, there are more and more subways.
3.0	More and more people prefer choosing undergrouds instead of cars.
3.0	Many of my classmates agree that the subway is more convinet and far more quickly.
3.0	They said there is no longer ''trafic jam'' when you take undergrounds.
3.0	And they told me they will take subways or bikes to school in stead of taking cars.
3.0	Isn't it a signal that there will be fewer cars in twenty years than than today?
5.0	Secondly,people won't choose driving because it is bad to the environment.
9.0	Now, people pay more attention to ''Green''---''315'' plan which means''one kilometer on foot; three kilometre riding; five kilometres take the bus; And our belief''low carbon transportation'',all of this shows that people will use some transportationsthat are friendly to the environment.
9.0	So there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.
5.0	What more, in the future, people will be busier---which leads that some people will be too busy to pass the licence, my mother told me any times that she wants to have a licence, however, she is too busy, so, untill now, she is not able to drive！
2.0	All in all, in  twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.
3.0	Nowadays many famous people would like to express thier feelings and opinions on some essential occasion, like Emma Watson giving a speech for UN to support femalism publicly, or Leonado Dicupprio shooting a documentary to call for people to care about our planet.
3.0	However, there seems to be statement on whether these words of celebraties have more influence on younger people than older people.
11.0	Well, in my opinion, I agree with this statement.
4.0	First of all, young people are inclined to embrace things more quickly.
8.0	They are young, so is thier mind.
8.0	Young people are not so mature that already have thier comprehensive sense of  the world, like the old people, which leaves them more space to absorb information and knowledge, and more space to understand a new type of theory.
8.0	In contrast, old people are arguabley stubborn in this regard.
4.0	Secondly, young people are more exposed to TVs, Internet and other modern medias that can make them have more connections with these celebraties and hear what they say.
9.0	By contrast, old people doesn't care the tabloids too much, they may focus more on their daily lives and how to stay healthy.
9.0	Those entertainment events does not be of their interests too much.
4.0	Last but not the least, the celebrity effects also cause young people to be influnced more easily.
8.0	For example, If you are a diehard follower of a singer or an actor, you will completely trust him and embrace all the things he has said on some public occasion.
8.0	On the contrary , it would be rare to find many followers among old people, as they are mature enough to konw what kinds of things are meaningful.
8.0	The older are a man, the more sensible he is.
8.0	This trend will become increasingly clear with the increasing of ages.
2.0	In conclusion, of course I'm not saying that the celebrities doesn't affect old people at all, but I do agrree thatthe influce it had on old people are smaller indeed.
3.0	With the development of society, television increasingly become common in our life.
3.0	Have a gimpse on this society, almost every family have television.
3.0	As we know, the television is an excellent entertaining pattern for people including the young children.
3.0	Therefore, it is hardly to avoid that young children be affected by the young children-oriented advertisment.
11.0	In my opinion, this kind of advertisement should be totally limited.
4.0	In the first place, the television advertising will cause lots of unnecessary business due to the fact that the young children between the two to five do not have mature cognitive ablity.
8.0	For instance, with the accelerance of the pace of the techlology, many television advertisement use vivid cartoon in the advertisement, which strongly attracts the young children.
8.0	Then the young children will buy this goods anyway including buying them individually and asking help for parents.
8.0	However, maybe these goods is totally unuseful for the family and parents, not to mention some goods like food will bring a lot of negative impacts on the children.
4.0	In the second place, some vivid advertising will bring bad impacts on children's physical and biological.
8.0	Take my little brother Jane as an instance.
8.0	Jane is just four years old.
8.0	We always watch television together.
8.0	He always approach to the television when some cartoon advertisement appear, which makes his eyesight become worse.
8.0	He can not see the far subject gradually and my mother take him to go the the hospital.
8.0	According to the doctor, his eye illness is caused by the television especially the cartoon advertising.
8.0	After that, Jane have to wear a children-use glass.
8.0	Aside from these bad things, he also hat the ghost in the cartoon advertisement.
8.0	Even he afraid to go to the woillet in the night.
8.0	As a consequence, the television advertising toward young children bring so many difficulties in the young children.
4.0	As a four years old child's brother, I hope that we can limite the young children-oriented advertisement because my  little brother tolerants huge hurts causing by this kind of advertising.
8.0	I hope that we can add more scientific program replacing this kind of advertising.
8.0	The reason is obvious, because the young children have a curiosity about the nature and science.
8.0	As we know, a huge number of famous people is inspired in their young age like the Hokin.
7.0	To sum up, we have to stop this kind of advertsing toward young children in order to avord the hut
3.0	Nowdays, how to make children study in good environment is a big question in the public for parents.
12.0	Some parents will to give large number of money for their kids to expect offering better life from them, however, it is controversy topic for the community.
12.0	May lots of prople think it is a good iead because it will make kids aviod of difficulties about substans of living, and more and more people against it because it may not benefit for kids.
5.0	Undeniable, it is great for children to not worry about the lack of basic elements from livelihood, and children can pay more attention on their study so they can get both good grade and comfotable environment.
10.0	It may the think of many parents,for who wants to make their children getting good educate.
5.0	However, in my opinion, it will get bad influence for kids.
8.0	If parents give their much moeny, they will thinking of how to use this money so they may buy  some expensive things, and these things may not nassesary for their life and study.
8.0	For these inmature kids, this scene can let them get bad habit such as wasting money, compare with each other and so on.
8.0	It is obvious that this consequence countering to expecting of parents.
0.0	Of cause, many students will not pay attention on study.
0.0	And the more bad thing for kids is that they will lose efforts to study.
0.0	Because they think they can dependent their parents, so they don't need to study and hard working, and when they grow up, the propotion of crime will higher.
10.0	So it is really important to improve kid's sense of money management.
3.0	Recently, the question regards whether grandparents can give the grandchildren useful advice because the world has changed largely has provoked attention from many people.
3.0	Some people claims that grandparents cannot give their grandchildren useful advice mainly because the world of today are too different from the world of fifity years ago.
3.0	While others disagree with the idea by stating that even though the world has changed but we can still learned a lot from our grandparents.
11.0	Personally, i support the idea that the grandparents can provide useful advice for their grandchild in modern times.
5.0	First of all, some advice is just useful no matter what age you are in.
8.0	For me, i was raised by my grandparents from the age of four to eight.
8.0	My grandfather always encourage me by telling me that i am the best forever in his mind.
8.0	This encouragement is quite dominent in my later success on my study.
8.0	I feel confident all the time which allows me to achieve the best of myself.
8.0	These kind of methods are still working in modern times, while many child just don't feel confident of themselves nowadays.
5.0	Secondly, grandparents are progressing with the world beyond our imagination which allows them to give advice even useful.
8.0	When you take the subway or bus, you can easily observe that the elder people around you is diiferent from what you have imagined.
8.0	They are using cell phones and pads like the most young people do.
8.0	They are also talking about the most heating news on the Internet.
8.0	That's the reason why we cannot underestimate our grandparents of their ability to catch up with the generation.
0.0	From what we have mentioned above, we may come to the conclution that grandparents can also give usful advice to their grandchilds in spite of the changing of the world.
0.0	That also means we have to listen to our grandparents patiently instead of ignoring them.
0.0	They will get healthier and happier with your accompany.
3.0	In today's world, the children's education problems is become more and more popular.
3.0	And then, the parents gives their children money and those children bring this money to school is good or not is become a big question.
12.0	In my opinion, te parents shou give their childrens a little bit money, because the children may need some money to buy pens, books, or some other aducation things.
4.0	First of all, some parents offer their children money is because the children needs money at school.
9.0	For example, some boys likes to do some sports during the clab time or after school, and they need money to buy some water to drink, and if     they hate themselves or other students, they will have money to buy medicionand, it is very important for those students.
9.0	That is the first reason I think parents give students money is an good idea.
4.0	Secondly, sometimes students need money to buy some important things, such as pens, notebooks, and so on.
9.0	Those education things are the most important things the students needs to use, because, if they do not have those things their  study will be effect, for a students, the study is the first things, they should use the better attation at school.
9.0	And if they because of the other things to affect their study, their moon will also effect.
4.0	Finally, if the children have some other problems, such as they lost some card which is use to buy food, they lost their phion or some other problems, they can use this money to find help.
10.0	For example, they could use those money to call a text and then they can go back home, if they lost their phion they can use those money to use the public phion.
2.0	In the summury, I think the parents needs to give their children money to go to the school, because money is useful and sometimes can help theim on time.
3.0	In this generation, the students grow up in a completely diffrent enviroment differing from their parents.
3.0	And how to reward their children is a really hard nut for parents to figure out.
3.0	Hence, there is a interesting debate on the floor, whether partents use money to reward their children when they get good grades in school.
12.0	From my perspective, I strongly support this idea.
4.0	First and formost, it can encourge students to study hard.
8.0	Every one loves money, no one is exception.
8.0	Even the young children know the neccesity of the money which can let them be able to do something like playing advanced comupter games, buying equipments they eager for a long time.
8.0	These tempations are not easy to resist.
8.0	And now, there is a method which can help them reach their dream objetcs easily --- getting a high-level grade.
8.0	For students, their duty is to study hard for the higher scores and these kinds of rewards give them motivation to work hard terribly to gain both the grades and the rewards which meet their need.
8.0	Once they become aware of the benefits of it, they will be situmulated to fight for the next exams.
8.0	Go round and roung, this will become a perfect cycle for the students.
8.0	From my own experience, since I was in primary school, my parents were ordered me some money wheneve I got higher ranking in my class and my grade.
8.0	I could be able to buy some comics that I loved most at that time and was excited when I stood in front of the counter of the bookstore.
8.0	In that case, being attacted by the monthly journal, I workd hard in every mothly examinations to get money from my partents buying the comics I wanted.
4.0	Moreover, this way of rewarding releases the burden of parents.
8.0	Nowardays parents have no time to think deeply how they praise their children when the do a good job in their study.
8.0	They even have no time to get known their children in depth.
8.0	They don't exactly know what their children really want.
8.0	In addition, owing to the generation gap, there is something just familiar with the school-age children which their parents will be disordered.
8.0	As a result, if parents buy something just they think good for their children, it may lead to a bad consequence, creating a family confilict in some extent.
8.0	Therefore, giving money to their children is really covenient choice for their parents.
8.0	To illustrate, my cousin loves Taylor Swift very much, but my uncle just knows that his son loves overseas music.
8.0	So he buys his son an album from Avril, and then they have a fight between the two stars.
8.0	After this unhappy experince, my uncle decides to give money to his son directly letting him choose whatever he wants.
4.0	Admittedly, it may creates a utilitarian mind in the scool-age children which is bad for them.
8.0	However, partents have the ability to control the amouts of money that they give to their children, which will not form a unhealthy thought if the parents have the awareness.
8.0	On the other hand, children will still walk into the society.
8.0	It can help them know how to manage their money since they are in childhood.
2.0	Overall, both for children and parents, offering money directly is a good choice.
12.0	Currently, a controversal topic has aroused intense debate among the public: whether people need to get along well with new people or stay in friends with a small group of people in order to be happier.
11.0	Opinions vary from person to person.
11.0	Some people argue that keeping making new friends make them feel happier.
12.0	On contrary, I think maintaining friendship with a small group of people brings me more happiness.
6.0	First of all, the friendship will become more precious and brings more happiness, if we keep maintaining it.
8.0	The ones who keep making friends usually have so many friends that it is impossible for them to remain friends for a long time.
8.0	However, if we focus on maintaining our friendships and spend more time on a small group of people, it is not strange to remain friends for the whold life.
8.0	For example, my grandfather met his best friends 60 years ago.
8.0	When my grandfather gets together with his old friend, they laugh a lot and forget all the disappointments, as if they are as young as 60 years ago.
8.0	None of the other friends can bring such happiness to my grandfather.
0.0	In addition, the friendship will be fasten and will not break up easily, if you keep maintaining it.
0.0	Many people make friends easily because of their apperance or status.
0.0	However, if they don't maintain the friendship, once the emergency occurs, all his friends will forget them.
8.0	They actually don't have any true friends.
8.0	On contray, if you spend more time with friends and keep maintain the friendship, they will never leave you behind and be willing to help you overcome the difficulties.
8.0	A case in point is that the stars are always welcomed in everywhere, and everyone wants to become their friends.
7.0	However, if a scandal about the star emerges, everyone will start to heat him and forget him
3.0	Recently, tons of people suggest the utility of group work and the significance of the ability to work with teammates.
3.0	With this tendency, many teachers choose to assign projects that ask students to work together instead of working on their own independently.
11.0	Some people believe that asking students to work together is a brilliant idea because students can help each other, but personally, I think students should do the projects by themselves to become an independent learner rather than seeking others' help, and in this way, they could learn more effectively.
5.0	To begin with, students work on the projects together cannot make all the students focus on what they are really interested more.
8.0	In a group project, to make every member of the project feels comfortable with what they are doing, the topic should satisfy everybody in the group.
8.0	In the case, some topics that single student in the group that is really curious would be abandoned because the project is for the whole group but not the single person.
8.0	Therefore, somebody in the group might lose his or her opportunity to learn what he or she really likes and be forced to finish a topic that is hardly interested in.
8.0	For example, I was in a chemistry project with 2 other students, they would like to an experiment about burning sugars but I want to know the phenomenon when I burn different metals, plus, I am pretty clear what will happen to burn sugars.
8.0	In this experiment.
8.0	I didn't learn anything new at all but wasted tons of time to try something I already knew about.
8.0	Therefore, working together isn't a great idea in terms of everyone's learning effectiveness.
5.0	Secondly, students who work alone on the projects can learn in their method that is effective for them.
9.0	In the projects, massive of research works are needed, but everybody has different study habits that are way different to each other.
9.0	Some like to make notes on different material but others like to make a mark on the website.
7.0	With all sorts of study habits, it is extremely hard to put all the works together and therefore waste plenty of time
3.0	According to CCTV News, recent years parents favor to give children money as reward for their well-done in tests or schoolwork.
3.0	Some parents even set different levels of money rewards correspond to the children's grades.
3.0	Some people find the method works well so they attach great significance to it.
12.0	However, from my perspective, instead of attracting childen with extra pin money, it is by guiding children to truly uncover the joys in study can do good to the students to a full extent.
6.0	"The greatest intellect Albert Einstein had said a famous quote which does like this:"" Interest is the best teacher."""
8.0	The goal of the parents who appeal to this kind of measure is no other than to let their children get  high grades in order to be admitted by a key school.
8.0	The original thought is not wrong.
8.0	However, this method can never draw students attention to the real study.
8.0	Instead, it leads children to concentrate more on the money they'll get.
8.0	In this case, children study hard not to fight for a bright future for themselves or to explore the world of knowledge, but to get the money to buy something they want.
8.0	It's of bad influence especially in the period when children are forming their own values.
8.0	So I deem it a bad idea to some extent.
2.0	What's more, in additon to lead the children to the wrong way, I think this kind of measure has another defect.
7.0	The money children get from parents differ from
3.0	Everyone in the society toady is derive for the success in their future career.
3.0	And what will be the key to the successful door?
12.0	My answer will be studying hard in school.
11.0	Without the hardworking at school your future could not be bright.
12.0	To gain success in our future career we must aquire plenty of kowledge from our schools.
8.0	Through this circumstances we need to work hard at school because the we need train our intellence by solid foundation of knowledge bases, altough sometimes we may find that the knowledge that we studied at school might be sort of bioring and not that practical but we still need to know without theser sort of things we could not make out some practical works.
8.0	Take my true experience as an example, I used to take a robotic competition, and our teacher suggest  us to study enginering at first.
8.0	At that time I totally oppeses this suggestion because I tought this kind of courses doesn't really have any use for our competition and I started my robot building up, at first I thought it was really easy but as the time moving the structure of my product become more and more complex, this time time when I thought the suggestion from the teachers I finally realize how important the theoretical knowledge from the hardworking from the school will be extrmely important for our future career and success in a future job.
6.0	Secondly the harworjing at school will make you get a good at school and this grade could push you up into a batter platform for your future development.
9.0	Somebody may thought that a good platform will have nothing to do with your future career but I said that though some people reach their dreams not by using a good platform, but they are just a small fragmenrt from a huge mountain, to reach the success you need to get into the climax platform inorder to meet better teacher for your future there.
9.0	More over a good platform could provide more chances for your work such as the top  50 schools in the United States will cropoate  with the company with the people development.
2.0	To get all the keys to scussess you need to work hard in the school.
12.0	The amelioration of technology brings us an issued that whether or not the old  keep learning up with the Times pales in importance to younger people.
12.0	Though i cannot completed deny the old's learning ability seems hard to receive new things, however some certain modern technique should be obatined by almost social members to make sure every single unit runs well in our life.
5.0	Initially, one reason makes my choice justifiable is the new system of payment through Zhifubao or Wechat.
8.0	A main payment approach in general places, such as  market, tax and online event.
8.0	It is far away from nothing but a huge revolution over social lifeway, which becomes an essential part of people's life, even among the old as well.
8.0	And the best way to know this is via learning.
8.0	Modern technology  develop  radically.
8.0	Everyone specially the old should keep pace with it to make everything easier rather than being like weirdo.
8.0	However if society runs without such functions, how it becomes such convenient.
8.0	How can give money to their child anywhere anytime?
8.0	How can they take urber or didi while facing traffic jam?
8.0	How can they pay the bill rapidly when they wanna see online movie?
8.0	Clearly the old obviously should evolve their skills, and without the opportunity to fulfill this, the old may maintain old fashion framework just not efficient.
5.0	Moreover, this cause leads even more credibility to my point of view that new technique offers more topic among people to socializing.
7.0	As it is known to people, the younger people and the old are divided by gap due to different si
12.0	Nowadays, many people consider a issue that is the government should spend money on the young children or spend money on universities.
11.0	But fgor my perspective, I am strong agree that is the government need to invest more to universitie.
11.0	There are several resons to support my opinion.
5.0	First and formost, If the government spend money to bulid up a complete education and service system which will have a huge influence for the students.
9.0	On the other hand, these students almost bigger than eighteen who have experience to study and work, such If they have assignment' they can use these money to solve their problem by their own, which will  improve the level of research.
9.0	However, if the government spend money on the young children's education; they would not konw the value of money which can help them to improve their study enviorment.
5.0	In addition, the universities students  are the qualified personnel whcih have a high level ones at various aspects; they knowing how to use these money maxium which means they can let these money realy helpful.
9.0	For example, my classmate study in MIT, and every years, the local government will sent lot of money to his team for the enviornment research; Recently, they achieve a reward, because they designed a device to filter out toxic gass, which is realy helpful.
9.0	It is obvious that the university' students know how to use these money not only for the research but also for the other people who can benefit from it.
2.0	Given the above points, it is better to spend money on universities rather than young children.
7.0	That is primari
3.0	Nowadays, the sociaty is full of compatitiveness.
3.0	In the work, people improve themselves constently in order to get better jobs or become leaders in the companies.
12.0	Some of the people indecate that the leadership is inborn.
11.0	However I still believe that this ability can be learnt by training themselves.
10.0	There are three reasons below.
6.0	Firstly, leaders need desires.
8.0	In other words, they need to desire to lead others.
8.0	However, desire is not innate.
8.0	There is an example of myself.
8.0	Actually, I am a outside girl, and it is easy for me to make a lot of friends.
8.0	In fact, i have the ability to lead others.
8.0	When i was a middle school studen, my headteacher always let me to organise some activities.
8.0	However, i am not interested in leading others.
8.0	Once, the teachers let me to lead our classmates to compose a simple dance in half and one hour, I spent three hours to compose it, i felt very tired and boring, also we do not have a good result at the end.
0.0	Although, it is important to have talents of leading others, the relevent knowledge of leading is much more important.
0.0	Specifically, if someone who don't have any knowledge in this aspect, they will not be able to lead others, even he/she is talented.
0.0	We can suppose that there is a person whose major in the university is math.
9.0	He is good at leading, and he is the president in the students union.
9.0	If we ask this person to lead some students to complete an art program, he cannot compelet this job either.
12.0	I think it is not a good idea for parents to offer money for children.
12.0	First,the children are too young to spend the money effectively,they may buy something useless and they just waste thier money.
12.0	Some kids may just buy snacks and toys.
11.0	And second,that may make them to be snobbish,and they just learn for thier parents and the parents'money.
11.0	We should let our children to know that they ought to learn for their own selves.
10.0	And the grades are not the only standard to measure if a kid is good or bad,the award may let them just aim to thier grades,and forget to improve thier other skills.
5.0	As parents,I think we can praise them when they get good mark at school,or buy some gifts for them.
9.0	When I was a student in primary school,my mother usually made novels as present for me when I got high marks in school,that made me very happy and didn't waste any money.
9.0	And she also took me to travels,that boraden my horizon.
5.0	In morden China,giving someone money for present is thought to be a vulgar action.
8.0	The parents and children are the same,if you always use money for present,that may lose all the meaning.
8.0	When the children grow up,she or he may be a person in poor taste.
8.0	So if you have children,when they do someting excellent at school,just give them oral praise,or you can give them presents,you can buy the things that they like,or take them for a meal,believe me,that may make them surprised,compared to give money to them.
1.0	The connection between the parents and the children is based on this,if you just give moneyfor gifts to encourage them,stop do that.
1.0	Hope you can have a better connectiong with your children in the future.
3.0	The method to educate students is always an issue that many teachers will think about.
3.0	In that case, whether students should work together for a project or they should work alone is of great importance to discuss.
11.0	In my opinion, I think when students work for one project together, they can learn more effectively.
5.0	The first reason is students can learn from each other in a group.
8.0	The purpose of a project is not only to let us show how excellent we have studied, but also to let us learn something.
8.0	For instance, when I have a problem about a math project, I can talk to my group members.
8.0	Everyone may have different ideas about the math problem and we can discuss it, then we can provide different solutions to solve that problem.
8.0	I learnt a lot through my group members.
8.0	Also the students who have no idea or only have one solution to that problem can learn from others.
8.0	A group can have discussion, while  one student alone cannot have diverse ideas and is lack of the chance to know better ideas, so he or she will learn less.
5.0	Second, students can learn other things like how to cooperate with each other by doing a project together, and this characteristic can help us learn more effectively in the future.
8.0	Cooperation is of great significance in the society and it is very necessary to learn it.
8.0	Take myself as an example, I had a project which need to construct a physics model in my junior middle school.
8.0	There are two solutions.
8.0	I can choose to do it alone or to do it with my classmates.
8.0	I choose to do it in a group and I make a division of the things all we need to do like searching for datas or to considerate what materials we need.
7.0	After we have done all of this, we will talk to each other about how we finished our part, so that we can do other parts next time and to learn Through that way,
3.0	Nowadays, many people like to chat about private news of entertaners and athletes.
11.0	There are many reason why they do so.
11.0	People can have bigger chances to know more about the superstars they like.
11.0	Also, knowing more of this information, they will have more topic with others.
11.0	However, in my opinion, people should let entertainers and athletes have more privacy.
5.0	First,with more privacy, the entertainers will be benefited.
8.0	They themselves will feel that they are respected.
8.0	Everyone has the things that he or she does not want others to know and has the right to keep them, so does entertainers.
8.0	It is really offensive to disseminate others' private news.
8.0	Indeed, some private news can make entertainers and athletes famous, which theyare willing to see.
8.0	However, if their scandals are exposed, a number of fans will be lost.
8.0	And the athletes are likely to feel anxious and perform bad in the competitions.
8.0	The famous really should have more privacy.
5.0	Furthermore, it is not good for people to knoe that much.
8.0	The kids should not attach to thore scandals of adult, which will probably stain them.
8.0	Fans should not too.
8.0	Knowing that the one they like have scandals will keep them away, even if that people is talented and has many famous opus.
8.0	This will also affect their own livesFor example, my sister liked a singer so much that she listen to hersong every day.
1.0	In conclusion, although curious about entertainers' private news, it is not good for us to know them.
1.0	Thus, we should give privacy and respect to the famous.
3.0	Celebrities has been heatedly disscussed nowadays, so most of people are willing to listen to their opinions.
11.0	Concerning this issue my stand point is that famous entertainers' advice are more important to younger people rather than obder people.
5.0	To begin with, following the celebrities idea provides adolescents with the opportunity to learn more about experience about life because they still have long trem to live.
8.0	To be more specific, students does not have many experience of life and job,but older people have so much experience,they do not need to know others opinions.
8.0	For example,my sister who is a graduates students wants open a company,but she do not know how to start it.
8.0	she dicides to watch the video about what is the famous entrepreur doing now.
5.0	In addition,young people like accepting new things and ideas,because most of older individuals are very traditional and inflexible.
2.0	In sum,judging from the reasons listed above, we can easily draw the concusion that   is more suitable.
3.0	Recently, there is a heated discussion about television advertising for kid who aged two to five.
3.0	Some people believe that television advertising should be allowed, because is not a big ideal for them to watch some advetising.
11.0	Howevr, others hold a dissimilar viewpoint that it should not be allowed.
11.0	As for me, I agree with the latter one.
12.0	My reasons and examples are listed as follows.
5.0	One reason why I am in favor of my perspective is that children will waste their money on those advertising.
8.0	This is becasue they just want to buy the things they want, not the things they need.
8.0	A good example of this is my little brother he is four years ago.
8.0	When he watched avertising about toys, he wants to buy these all.
8.0	My grandparents loved him, therefore, everytime he asked for the toys on the tv, they will find a way to buy them.
8.0	After a few years, his room is full of toys, but he still wants more.
8.0	As the exampl sugguest, allowed children to watch advertising are wasting money.
5.0	Another relevant reason used to supporting opinion that allowed children to watched television adevetising may lead them in danger.
8.0	This is due to the fact that when they watched something cool, they are like to imitated.
8.0	A typical illustraction of this can be seen in my brother's classmates.
8.0	He has the same age with my brother.
8.0	Once he watched a cool advertising on the tv, is about a boy climbing a tree.
8.0	Then that boy told my brother he will try this after school.
8.0	Finally, he climb the biggest tree in the garden, but he broken his legs.
8.0	Now he still in the hospital.
8.0	The example indicates that children need far away from advertising, especially not to imitation the dangrous part.
11.0	I think it is okay for parents to offer school-age children money for each high mark they get in school.
11.0	The first reason is that as teenagers, we have lots of things to do every day and somtimes we can't focus on our studying.
11.0	We would like to play outside or we just want to hold as many parties as possible.
12.0	Therefore, offering money to school-age children is a good idea to make children enthusiatic about learning and getting good grade.
5.0	The second reason is that offering children money if they get goods grades can make children aware of the difficulty to make money.
8.0	Making money is not just what only parents should care about.
8.0	Children should gradually learn how to make money and use money, too.
8.0	In recent days, we can easily pay for the bills using smartphones and we do not use paper money as much as before.
8.0	This great change makes the big problem that we don't have the exact feeling about how much we have spent.
8.0	We tend to spend more money nowadays.
8.0	Getting good grads is not very simple.
8.0	Once children notice the difficulty to get money, they will not buy what they want wihout deep thoughts.
5.0	The third reason is that offering children money if they get good grades can make children notice the importance of studying.
8.0	Parents should make their children to form the habit of studying for the whole life.
8.0	This world changes very quickly and we have no idea if we will be abandoned by the society someday.
8.0	We should study as hard as possible to get better education and get high social status.
8.0	Offering money to the children can let them face the dark side of the society.
0.0	Overall, I agree with the idea to offer children money for each mark they get in school for the 3 reasons above.
0.0	Therefore, parents should let their children experience different sides of the society.
0.0	This world is not as wonderful as the textbooks taught.
0.0	This way to offer money is very creative and parents should use this way to teach their children.
3.0	Studying in university is a precious chance for students to get accustomed to their future career.
12.0	Additionally, different people have divided opinions about how to improve the quality of education in universities.
12.0	Some people claim that the best way is to increase professors' salsries.
11.0	However, as far as I am concerned, there are several more reasonable measures.
5.0	First and foremost, universities should invest more on the schools' facilities.
8.0	That is because advanced facilities can give students a better experience of learing and living, which deserves universities' investment.
8.0	I have a case to aptly illustrate my point.
8.0	I am a postgruade, and sometimes I have to surf the internet to search for the latest papers in my field.
8.0	Formerly, the computers in my laboratory were in bad condition, which indeed lowered my work efficiency.
8.0	However, this semester, school renovated the old computers.
8.0	Thus, I can deal with my tasks more quickly with the help those new computers.
5.0	Moreover, universities are supposed to provide more financial aid for those students who are in need.
8.0	Today, students form neady cannot afford some useful study utensils, which is adverse to their learning.
8.0	Additonally, this problem is able to be solved throuth schools' financial support.
8.0	My own experience can be a salient example.
8.0	One of my roomates Jack was even  incapaple of possessing his own laptops due to his limited financial ability, bringing him lots of unconveniece.
8.0	However, two months ago, he used the loan provided by our school to buy a new computer.
8.0	Thus, he can use the computer to not only to get the access to lots of useful education resources.
12.0	Whether or not teachers should make their social or political views known to students in the classroom is an debated topic.
11.0	While some people may feel that students will pay more atteniton to society and politics if teachers share their political or social views in class, I do not believe that this is the case.
12.0	By contrary, I think that we should prevent teachers sharing their views on politics and sociey in front of students because it will take up the time originally meant for imparting knowledge as well as shape students' value system in the long run.
5.0	With the burst of population, students nowdays are faced with fiercer competition than ever before because they can never be excellent enough to be outstanding among people around them.
8.0	As a result, they are burdened with enormous education pressure such as they have more home assignment to do, they should get excellent grades and they are obliged to outstand in various academic competitions.
8.0	All of these demand a reasonable use of time during class.
8.0	Therefore, teachers ought to make good use of every single minute in the class to equip their students with better education performance that promises a bright future instead of sharing social or political views irrelavent to the topic of class.
5.0	On top of that, the students are not mature enough to tell right from wrong accoding to their own value system.
8.0	If their subject views on social and political events are shared with their students, the students may be apt to accept the teachers' views even if the views are pessimistic and harmful.
8.0	With time going by, their whole value system will be shaped accordingly.
8.0	As is reported by the media, some abnormal teachers rape their students because they think students should serve teachers.
8.0	So if this idea is frequently shared in the class, the students will regard it their duty to 'serve' the teachers by sex instead of calling for help when harmed and in turn their life will be ruined.
3.0	Nowadays , many parents want their students to get a higher grade in their school so parents try many methods to encourage their children .
3.0	And most parents may offer their students money for each high mark in school .
12.0	As far as I am concerned, it is a good idea to encourage school-age children .
6.0	When I was in junior school , I was bad in math and I did not want to study this subject .
8.0	Once upon a time , my father told me that he would give me enough money to buy what I want if I got a high mark in math in the final exam .
8.0	After I heared  my father's promise , I am encouraged a lot .
8.0	From then on , I had great energy to let me study math well .
8.0	I did not hate this subject and tried my best to solve difficult math problems .
8.0	Finally , I really got a higher mark in the school final exams .
8.0	My father offered me enough money to let me buy what I want to buy .
8.0	What is more , I found that I was interested in math and not hate this subject any more .
0.0	So I really think this is a perfect idea when parents encourage school-age children .
0.0	It can make their childre have a real goal and this goal will encourage school-age children to study more hard .
0.0	And the most important thing is that they will get high grade and fall in love with study .
3.0	Everyone has a social network and political treatment in their mind to communicate with others.
11.0	Some one believes that teacher should not make their social or political opinion known to students in the classroom.
11.0	I want to argue with the statement.
12.0	I think teachers are able to discuss about social and politcal with their students like a friend.
5.0	Firstly, students know social skill and political system early from teachers helps them enter the communities better in the future.
8.0	There are a lot different kind of people who we need communicate with in the society.
8.0	Learning the social ability from teachers make students know how to deal with the problem with each other and how to work and study in a group.
8.0	For example, when a student argues with another student because one agrees with a point but another one diagrees with it.
8.0	Both of them will explain their idea to make people support their statement.
8.0	It is improve their social study because their teachers tought them the solution about social network.
5.0	Secondly, students can protect themselves according their political knowledge when they have studied about social skills and polity.
7.0	Students study
3.0	As working and living with hustle in today's society, working tend to be more boring because it pay much attention on the efficency.
3.0	Whether workers can be gritifed by various types of works or single task is hotly debated for all walks of classes.
5.0	As far as I am conerned, satisfication are more likely to be obtained by diversified tasks.
5.0	Diversity of the tasks, to begin with, can provided us a chance to experience differently to gain a sense of freshness.
8.0	Workers are likely be in a good mood because they are trying something new and some of them are an brand new journey for them, which are contributive to worker's gritification.
8.0	To illustrate, if teachers are given a different task like doing something about adminstration other than teaching.
8.0	A new experience will give teachers incentives and movitiation to do it and trigger their desire to discover the new things, which will give them passion and they are more likely to be satified.
8.0	More importantly, There will be a platform for them to have a good commond of adminstration works which may help them in designing their teaching plans, managing their classes and tackling the problems occurred in their lifes.
8.0	Not only can people are mentally happy but also help them in a practical way.
8.0	Thus, they are more likely to be satisfied.
2.0	What is more?
8.0	the various tasks will help people to reexmine if they are suitable for their positions, assiting them to make a change for a better life.
8.0	With more people are in a positon that they are not really fond of and confused about which jobs they should engage in, provided with boundful tasks, people can get a chance to konw things about different positon and find what their passion really lay in.
8.0	For example, staff are given different tasks form different apartment of the company to complete.
8.0	It is also a progress for them to know the features of different kinds of task and check whether they are suitable for this kind of jobs.
8.0	Consquently, they are possilble to find what they really have a passion with and make a change to live a life or choose a work which is better for them.
3.0	In the high-speed development world, new technologies or science thriving day by day.
3.0	In order to keep abreast of the changes in society, young people have to improve themselves more or follow the higher standard.
11.0	Some people hold a view that it is too severe for the youth to comply with the rules, while for me, I hold an opposite point.
4.0	Admittedly, these strict rules or demands will be hard to young people to follow since it will add some pressure to the youth and thus lead to some diseases.
9.0	But it is not a case since it is better for individuals to suit for the environment rather than be shifted out of the society.
9.0	They have to adjust themselves constantly for a better future.
4.0	First of all, young people have to abey these regulations in order to satisfy the demand of whole society.
8.0	Since the more our world developed, the more talented people they need.
8.0	It will be abandened by the society if human beings especially the youth stop going.
8.0	A survey did a teat about a bounch of young people.
8.0	They were tested for their respounces in the same situation.
8.0	It showed a result that young people from the higher required companies represented a more quickly and more organized solution to the problems than that who were in more relaxed companies.
8.0	Through this survey I can make a conclusion that the more tempering environment ca shape talents more.
4.0	Furthermore, the rules of this society can be a way of motivaton for young people.
8.0	They are supposed to learn more and keep fullfill themselves in order to be more competitive in job hunting market.
8.0	As for me, a granduate student in collage, I have prepared a lot for my next hunting season.
8.0	From the freshman, I entered into the lab to do some researchs, joined in the students' goverenment to practice my social skills and also took part in a lot of sports game to strenth my body.
8.0	I know clearly that I have to be a comprehensive-development person or I will not get a good job with high salary.
8.0	I am wondering if the world did not develop so fast, can I have some motivation to be a talent one?
8.0	The answer is definetely not, and the same as my comtemporary.
8.0	So, strict environment is better for the development of young people.
1.0	In a nutshell, it is advisable to claim that the rules young people are required to follow are not too strict for them.
1.0	Not only for the self-development but also for the progress of the whole society.
3.0	In the modern society, an increasing parents are more likely to educate their children such as learing the financial management at a young age.
11.0	However, many people and even the educator opposes the opinion since the the children are too young to take the financial responsibilty.
11.0	In my perspective, I agree the children can learn how to manage their own money when they get elder.
5.0	Initially, children have not yet established a correct value of financial management at a pretty early age.
8.0	Although the early education is popular, the money is not included in one of the aspect of this education since the children have not a description towards the marketing, and  even the price of their toys.
8.0	I remember there was an interview on the TV show about the what 5 RMB can buy.
8.0	Superisingly, many children in the kindergarden or in the elementary school said 5 RMB could buy a huge soft toy or just a small lollipop.
8.0	However, the correct answer was that 5 RMB worths a large bottle of cola.
8.0	In this case, the vague value towards the money can not have take responsibility to the money.
5.0	Moreiver, it is too risky for childrean to bring money themselves.
8.0	Although we live in a peaceful society, the crime rate has not dramatically decrease in the recent years.
8.0	Still, there are so many pieces of news concrening the crimes happened around the world.
8.0	Imaging whay may happen if a children is carrying a large amount of money.
3.0	The story of success is always fascinated and attracts many people to follow their ambitious dreams.
11.0	However, only small parts of the dreamer finally success, because they understand it is impossible to realize their dream with a single step, and only realistic goals can lead them to their dreams.
5.0	To begin with, the ambitious dream is too far to reach, but the realistic goals can help us to overcome the distance.
8.0	It is common that many passionate young people enter the society with their dreams, and find that it is almost impossible to be as successful as the ones in story.
8.0	The gap between their dream and themselves devastates their ambition, make them think it is impossible to reach the other side of the gap.
8.0	However, they don't understand that the ones in the story were once in the same situation with them, but they overcame all the difficulties by reaching one and another small but realistic goals.
8.0	Steve Jobs, the former CEO of Apple, started his company with his friend in his basement.
8.0	He embraced an ambitious dream in his mind and made it come true by achieving many realistic goals, the first CPU, the first computer and the first iPhone.
8.0	He went step by step and finally reached his dream.
5.0	In addition, always following the dream makes people lose their direction, but achieving realisitic goals remind them of their dreams.
8.0	When our dream is too far from us, we may not know what to do first.
8.0	At this time, to make some realistic plan will help us to make breakthrough.
8.0	We need the realistic goals to be the guideline to let us keep moving forward, but not lost in despair.
8.0	For example, I always wanted to study in Wuhan University when I was  young.
8.0	But I also knew it is not easy to do.
8.0	I started by making small goals, for example, reaching the top grade in class.
8.0	And after years hard work, I finally succed.
7.0	To sum up, we need realistic goals to guide us to the dreams
12.0	I don't think it is a good idea anymore.
12.0	I think children don't need so many money.
8.0	Therefore this situation of giving thire chlidren for each grade is for encourage thire children to get better grade in the next time.
8.0	But we have to face a serious question.
8.0	On one day, if you don't give money to your children, they still remain good grades?
8.0	In the light of the present situation, they don't get good grades abviously.
8.0	If I explain more clearly, the situation is that you depend on money to catch your children's mind on study.
8.0	Although so far there isn't large quetions, as long as this situation is broken, the result we can't image anymore.
8.0	So the best method is developing your child's interest in learning.
8.0	Only do that, your children can be immune to the needs of the meterial.
8.0	So I suggest that you can study with your children and let them feel that he don't study alone.
8.0	And you also can talk with your kind about thier school time, it is also a good way to be closer with your kinds.
8.0	You have to teach thier correct Philosophy and worldview like money isn't almighty.
8.0	By the wat, you can also use some suitable way to reward your children just like giving them a kiss or some clapping.
8.0	These presents isn't only let them feel happy, but also bring the correct Philosophy.
8.0	All in all, I think offer school-age children money for each high grade isn't a good idea.
8.0	And so many presents can replace this anymore.
7.0	TODAY MANY PARENTS LIKE TO GIVE MONEY FOR THEIR CHILDREN JUST FOR THE HIGH SCORE OF THE EXAMIATION
7.0	I DO NOT THING
7.0	THAT IS A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE THEY CAN NOT LET CHILDREN FEEL THAT THE  MARK CAN BE MEASURE BY THE MONEY
7.0	BUT IN SOME REASON IT IS GOOD BECAUSE IT MAY ENCOURAGE CHILDREN TO HARDLY GET A HIGH SCORE AND LET THEM FEEL THAT THE WORKS HE MADE IS DESERVE
7.0	BUT IN A GENERAL ASPECT PERSONALLY THE HABIT WHICH MADE BY IT IS BAD NOT ONLY BECAUSE IT MAY LET CHILDREN BECAME MONEY LIKING
7.0	BUT ALSO THE MONEY IS TOO MUCH FOR THE VOLUNTEERS
7.0	THE BADEST RESULT OF IT IS THE SCHOOL BULLY MAY BE CAUSE AND THE CHILDREN IN THAT AGE HAVE NO ABILITY TO MANAGE THEIR MONEY THAT MEANS
7.0	THEY MAY WASTE THEM IN THE WEBBAR OR EVEN SMOKING AND DRINKING
7.0	I THINK PARENTS GIVE MONEY TO THEIR CHILDREN HAVE NO MISTAKE
7.0	BUT ITS TO EARLY
7.0	THEY CAN USE MONEY TO ENCOURAGE THEM AFTER THEY WERE ABLE TO MANAGE THEIR MONEY AND GIVE MORE FOUCES INTO THEIR STUDY BUT NOT JUST PAY THEM THAT IS A FANCTION WHICH IS REDIC
12.0	From my perspective,I believe that it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.
8.0	Here are my reasons:first,when you are watching a movie or reading a book,you will keep a gesture that you feel very comfotable.
8.0	So your body will get relax and your cells can get more nutrition from the air ,which has been confirmed by Wuhan University.
8.0	So your cells can be more energetic,and you can get more power.
8.0	Second,if you watching a movie or reading a book ,you  will not consumer more energy if you doing physical exercise.
8.0	Besides,as it known to all,after you doing phsical exercise,the salt in your body will get out from the hole on the skin.
8.0	You will feel very exhausted,for which your blood is lack of salt to work.
8.0	After all,salt is very essential to any kind of plants and animals.
8.0	When I was younger,I was so addicted to playing football.
8.0	However,I did not drink as much water as I need .
8.0	In that case, I often get cold after exerciding.
8.0	Looking back,I am so convinced that it was because I did not get enough salt to maintain my energy.
8.0	On the countary,you will not get such feellings if you relax by watching a movie or readong a book.
8.0	Third,if someone who has problems of lung,throat and heart,exercise may cause much pressure to them.
8.0	Your body would get ill.
8.0	By watching a movie or reading a book,you will never get that bad endings.
8.0	Last but not least,watching a movie and reading a book can not only open our eyes,but also enrich our knowledges.
8.0	I hope every one will join the group of reading a book,only by doing this our country will develop faster,our nation will become more powerful.
3.0	The social moving and operating depends on every member's work and an ideal job is an attraction for everyone no matter what's your identity.
3.0	Many people enjoy a job where they work only three days a week but for long hours because they think the rest of the week can be used freely.
12.0	From my perspective, I prefer a job where I work five days for shorter hours for in this way I needn't be under big pressure and I can keep on doing my work better.
5.0	First, shorter days-long hours' work can put a large pressure on me and I will feel very exhaust.
8.0	Shorter days-long hours' work means I must deal all the things in a short time and the work also should be good as I use more days to do it.
8.0	Last summer, I plan to a travel to the statue of liberty but I have a lot of homework to finish.
8.0	Then I did the work day and night for two whole days and I was ill.
8.0	Finally, I could not continue my plan.
8.0	It is a big shame.
5.0	Second, I can keep the pace to my work if I work five days.
7.0	If I only work three days a week
7.0	I w
3.0	To my own oppinon, I think the best way to relax from the whole day of studing is doing physical exercise.
12.0	Instead of watching TV or reading a book, doing exercise can make us more fun.
5.0	Whithout doudt playing sports is a way of keeping our health.
8.0	After sitting in the office for more than 8 hours, your body has already tired.
8.0	At this time, go for a walk for 30 minutes may be a good choice to let your blood turns to move more active.
8.0	Most of the white-coller workers have been
5.0	However, playing sports also can not only a means of exercise, but also a particular oppotunity to promote your friendship.
8.0	While playing whith friends, you may have a lot of fun, sometimes laughing.
8.0	On the other hand, during the play, you can also find yourself more active and even more outgoing.
8.0	For example, I like playing basketball, so I have made a lot of friends and have had so many fun.
8.0	Sometimes some of us hurts, we are all warm-hearting and helped her to the dispensary at once.
8.0	So whenever I play basketball with friends I feel like I have owned the world.
10.0	Playing ph
3.0	It is a tend that a lot of people like to go to gyms and take physical exercise.
3.0	They belive that doing phycial execise can help them forget the diffculties from their work.
12.0	But some other people do not agree with it, these people choose methods like watching a movie or reading a book help them relax after one day's hard work.
5.0	It is not denying that doing physical exercise can help us get relaxed.
10.0	During the exercise, thinking is not the main activity anymore.
5.0	However, watching a movie or reading a book is a more efficient way to relax.
9.0	People may get tired after physical exercise, but it never happens after watching a movies, because physial exercise consumes much energes.
9.0	In theater, we always sit on soft chairs,
10.0	Further more,
3.0	Having a breif glimpse at today's educational system,we can easily come out with a conclusion that high grade matters a lot in the whole system.
3.0	Schools and parents consider marks as the most direct way to evaluate the students' performance in their school studying.
3.0	Even some parents take the high grades as a standard to offer their children money,which also indicates the importance of high marks.
4.0	There is no doubt that high grade is a crucial way in estimate the perfomance of a student.
10.0	In the aspect,providing children money by judging their grade is a reasonable way,but that are not supposed to be the only thing to be concerned about.
4.0	To start with,relating money to high grade,in a sense,can stimulate students to work harder at their school work.
8.0	As a well-knowed Chinese notion goes,the more the stimulus,the more the motivation.
8.0	Apparently,everyone likes money,without wich one can not do anything.
8.0	In this aspect, money is considered the optimal choice to put impetus on students.
8.0	With the purpose of obtaining the money,the students maintained a stronger will to fight for high marks,which can facilitate their understanding of their text books and get high grade.
8.0	This seems to be a benefitial way both for students and their parents.
8.0	If a student works diligently and gets a good denouement,their parents would be pleased and offer them money readily.
4.0	Nevertheless,every coin has its two sides.
8.0	Using money as a stimuli for children to get high marks may lead them in the wrong directions.
8.0	We are definitely reluctant to see that the students care too much about money and become secular in their most innocent age.
8.0	Even worse,some students may conspire with other schoolmates to cheat in the eaxm in order to get high grade,which are bond to have an harmful effet on their future life.
4.0	Parent are never supposed to judge their children only by their marks.
8.0	There are more significant things they can concern about.
8.0	For example,mental and physical health,their relationshio with teachers and friends,etc.
8.0	If students fall into a wrong path,it will be fruitless to get high grades,no matter how high the marks are.
10.0	To conclude all the perspectio
3.0	If you are a small child, how would you feel if your father asks you to finish the math homework when you are chatting with your schoolmates happily?
3.0	How would you feel if your mother orders you to go to the gym and do some exercises to streghten your body when you are playing online games with your friends?
3.0	I would unlikely to obey these structions.
3.0	So as far as I am concerned, educating children is more difficult than it was in the past due to the presence of cell phone, onliine games and social networking Web site.
5.0	For one thing, children today can be easily addicted to online games which will cost them a lot of time on it and make them not want to study.
8.0	Of course, every child likes playing, but the easy access and easy giveback system will make them quickly addicted to the online games.
8.0	For example, owing to the fact that my mother is a middle school teacher, I get to know that many children today like to go to the net bar frequently where they can play the online games freely.
8.0	It often takes a lot of time for their parents and my mother to educate them not to go to the net bar anymore and meanwhile pay more attention on their study.
8.0	On the contrary, when I was a child, friends around me didn't have phones and computers, thus I spent more time studying because there were a lot of interests in the book.
8.0	So children today are more difficult for parents to educate.
5.0	For another, the unsuitable words on the social network media may affect the thoughts of children today and make them unwilling to listen to their parents.
8.0	"You can meet any people and any different kinds of words on the internet where some children can probably see the words like ""It is useless to study""."
8.0	As we all know, children haven't gone through many difficults so they can be easily affected by others.
8.0	This kinds of words directly meet the unwillingness in their hearts.
8.0	However, few people had access to the internet and  the only way children in the past got knowledge is their parents and teachers, who were very responsible to their development and would do their best to educate.
8.0	That is the reason why educating children is a more difficult tasks\ than it was in the past.
3.0	What's the founction of the advertisements?
3.0	Attracting a larger number of the customers buy the products ?
3.0	Telling people the advantage of the products?
11.0	The answer is definitely yes.
11.0	In order to get more benefit, the companies will choose to advertise their product.
11.0	From my perspective, I really agree with the statement, because the companise can win more money.
5.0	If the companies exaggerate the advantage in the advertisements, more consumers will buy the products.
8.0	People will be attracted by the advange of the products and but them automatically.
8.0	Take myself as an example, once I saw a advertisement about a kind of trousers on the internet.
8.0	The advertisement said that this trousers can let our legs look thin very much.
8.0	When I got this this imformation, I became crazy and buty that trousers immediately, because I really want my leg looking like thin.
8.0	But when I recieved the trousers, I realized that it was just a common trousers and I knew the advertisement was totally wrong.
8.0	Since then, I do not believe the advertisement anymore, because the advertisemnet is just a way to attract us by their products.
8.0	And I know now that the companies will make the products seem much better then they really are in the advertisement to attract more customers buy the products.
5.0	Although some advertisements are right, most of advertisements are really wrong.
8.0	The companies will not give precise imformation, which means they will use the advantages to cover up the disadvantages.
8.0	One year ago, my mother bought a swob on the internet.
8.0	The advertisement said that the swob can clean the house by using only little water and can clean the house cleaner than other swops.
8.0	Indeed the information is right.
8.0	But there was a big pronblem is the weight of the swob.
8.0	My mother can hardly take it, because it was too heavy to use.
8.0	The advantsge is really good actually, but the disadvantsge is too big and affect the use of the products.
8.0	The companies will not tell us the disadvantage in the advertisement to attract us to buy the products.
7.0	All in all, I really agree with the statemant that the products in the advertisement i
3.0	Nowadays, the education of children is debated hotly.
12.0	Some parents claims that children should learn from their own mistake while others controdict that statement.
11.0	I think the parents should teach children and prevent them making mistakes.
4.0	Firstly, it is parents' duty to teach children how to behave well.
9.0	Children are lack of basic knowledge about right and wrong.
9.0	God sent parents to lead young children on the right way and tell children that hurting others is injustice, and protecting others is justice; thiving is injustice, and paying for goods and servece is justice; telling lie is injustice, and telling truth is justice.
4.0	Moreover, the process of making mistake will hurt children themselves and others.
8.0	For example, news had suggest that a 6-year-old children played fireworks in his house.
8.0	The fire grew up rapidly and burn nearby floors.
8.0	5 people, including that child, had dead of that fire.
8.0	The disaster could have been avoided if the parents had told the child how dangerous the firework is.
4.0	Although some critics cliams that the experience of making mistake would be more impressive for  children and prevent them form making the same mistake again, it is a waste of money and time.
8.0	Learning from experience of ancestors is the basic skill of human.
8.0	We save ample time to process when we learn the rule of Newton instead of try thoudsand of times to find that rules again.
8.0	Parents should follow that routine to teach children and let them learn more effeciently.
2.0	To sum up, the parents should help children learn skills and knowledges instead of let them to make mistakes, because it is more effective and hmartless.
3.0	Do you think today's life become more and more comfortable than before with the development of high technology and some convenient inventions?
3.0	Compared with your grandparents childhood, which kind of life do you think is easier?
11.0	From my perspective, I really agree with the statement with some specific reasons.
5.0	More and more convenient inventions help people save a bunch of time and people can finish many things by using our smartphone only.
8.0	Take Ma Yun, a famous Chinese businessman who is busy everyday, as an instance to support my point of view.
8.0	He needs to copy with thouthands of contracts every day which should be regared really carefully.
8.0	But there is a problem is that he need to buy food for a long time because of the extreme long line of every restaurant.
8.0	For people many years ago, they can only try to buy food in advance personally to save time.
8.0	On the contrary, Ma Yun is fortunately to enjoy the convenience of nowadays new invention--take out food which means we only need to book food online and wait the specific people send food to our hand.
8.0	This new invention becomes more and more popular in China because this can really help those busy men save time.
8.0	In addition, we can eat anything we want by booking food online without need to waste time and drive far away for only a specific kind of food.
8.0	From this, we can know that because of the new invention in nowadays, people's life become more and more convenient than before.
8.0	Our need can easily be satisfied by today's new inventions including taking out food, public sharing bicycles, intellect robborts and so on.
5.0	Although population in today's society become larger and going out become a really complex and time-consuming thing than before, our needs also change a lot, which means people at before may only want to go out and travel easil,s o they can become really happy, but today's people are going to pursue their mild enjoyment.
8.0	Take myself, a high schooll students as an example to illustrate my own perspective.
8.0	My grandfather says that they used to live in the vilige and it is difficult for them to have a glimpse of ourward world.
8.0	However, today's life become more convenirnt because of large amount of nes transportations.
8.0	At this time, I will not go to complain about the traffic jam in the crowded rode and what I will want is to have some mental rest.
8.0	Thus, large population is nowadays is not a big deal because more and more people focus their attention on the mental world rather than the physical world any more.
8.0	Thus, today's life not only become convenient and easier, but also become more enjoyble and relaxed.
0.0	In summary, life today is much easier in terms of the new inventions and new chase.
0.0	People's mind changes a lot, so their feelings to this world also alters a lot.
0.0	So why can't we say that today's life is easier and more comfortable?
3.0	Recently, a topic has aroused a heated debate: whether young people today are more possible to invest their time and efforts on the improvement of the world than young people in the past?
11.0	Some people do not agree with it because they think if there were no young people who invested their time to improve the world, we might not have today's life.
11.0	However, I definitely agree that young people today make more contributes to improving the world than young people in the past made.
5.0	To begin with, today's young people work harder on developing high technology to make the advance.
8.0	With the coming of computer and the Internet, an increasing use of artificial intelligence has benefited almost all the fields in the world.
8.0	This trend makes more and more young people today choose Computer Science as their major.
8.0	They learn various programming languages and hunt jobs in different companies as system engineers, which leads them to contribute themselves to their careers to invent more high-tech products to benefit the whole world.
8.0	However, young people in the past did not have the environment to learn high-tech knowledge, they could even not afford a computer, so all they did in the past was to improve their own life, not the whole world.
5.0	Moreover, young people today have more concious to protect the environment and the whole ecosystem.
8.0	In the past hundred years, the development of agriculture and industry all over the world has brought a large amount of serious probelms to the ecosystem.
8.0	An increasing number of young people learn about protecting the environment in their universities, and become environmental protecting ones to deal with diverse polluted problems.
8.0	On the contrary, in the past, young people only wanted to make profits rather than protected the environment.
8.0	"They did not have the sense of ""green"", so the environment today is hurt so seriously."
7.0	From what has been mentioned above, we can draw a conclusion that young people today improve the would
3.0	I think the idea for some parents that offering their school-aged children money for each high mrak is helpful to their kids.
3.0	Since the parents treat education much more important today, some of them even creat some new methods to encourage their kids to improve their academic perfomence.
3.0	For example, some parents give their children money as a reward for getting high marks.
3.0	They may expect that it will change the attitide of children to study.
11.0	However, i think it is totally a good idea.
4.0	First of all, giving money to the children as a reward can stimulate children to study harder.
8.0	When children get positive feedback of their hard work, the study can be a joyful task rather than a boring duty.
8.0	We can not deny that sometimes study is really boring, doing a lot of exercises, reading books and finish the text paper.
8.0	So offering some reward for their kids seems like setting a goal for them which can keep their interest, If they can use the money to buy what they want, they will try their best to pursue high mark.
4.0	Moreover,financial thinking as an important ability which is important for everyone in the society.
9.0	So teaching our children how to manage their own mone.
9.0	During the method that giving children money as a reward, children will have a chance to manage their own money.
4.0	Last but not least,it is unwise to give too much money to their kids once a time when their chidren get a good mark , since the children will seek only for money during their study instead of getting the real knowledge.
10.0	The goal we expect is to encourage our children and tell them to get money by their own effort.
1.0	All in all, if we make sure that children will not misunderstanding the meaning of the reward and keep a healthy attitude to study.
1.0	It is a good idea.
11.0	I don't agree watching movie or reading book are better than doing physical exercise.
12.0	Doing phsical exercise can keep our healthy and improve our relationship with our friends.
5.0	today many teenagers are troubled by their health.
8.0	it has become a hot topick among the people  especially the young.
8.0	why teenagres don't have a strong body today?
8.0	because they just watching movie,tv or computer game.
8.0	for this they can not have enough time to do exercise.
8.0	these activity are all electric facilities which are bad for teenagers' eyes.
8.0	if we don't have a heathy body, we will not contiune our study and our classmate will lauth at the people who has poor health.
8.0	for the times go by the person who has a poor health will not have many friends and he doesn't get along well with other people.
5.0	in addtion doing exercuse can improve our friendship.
8.0	we do exercise with our friends we will what is teamwork.
8.0	some of exercise are played with by two more people so we have to make a teamwork.
8.0	from these kind of exercise we can increase our leadership skills and how to make a teamwork and let our friendship stronger and stronger.
8.0	these skills only learn from by these kind of exercisee are not watching movie or reading books.
10.0	In gener
12.0	I don't agree with this statement.
12.0	As know to all,relaxation means not think the mass or bad thing,then do what you want to do and feel happy from the process .
12.0	If you like reading book or watching a movie more than doing physical exercise,you might say the statement is correct ,but for me it's different.
12.0	Doing physical exercise is good to health,and during the pirior time of exercising,we can concentrate on what we are doing like reading and watching,and most of the exercise can be played with friends toghter .
8.0	Playing with friends can get more happiness than myself,like basketball,I can hold a match when there are at least six people even some of them whom I didn't get well with,after the game ,we will have a new choice with each other.
8.0	when I'm only one to relax ,I'd love to have a cup of coffee and an interesting book to go through the whole peace afternoon.
8.0	When our family have a common holiday ,we would choose to watch a new film .
10.0	There is no the best way to relax .
11.0	Many people would say that it is not important to know about events happening around the world, even if it is unlikely that they will affect your dauly life because most of the events will not affect our common life.
11.0	I  agree that it is not important to know about events happening around the world, enen if it is inlikely that they will affect your daily life.
12.0	After all, i am very busy everyday so i hardly to spend most of time to know about events without influence my daily life.
11.0	However, in my opinion, it is important to know about events happening around the world, even if it is unlikely that they will affect your daliy life.
6.0	First of all, people should have wide field of vision.
8.0	With the faster speed of our world, people need to keep up with the world speed or be eliminated by the world.
8.0	People should know all the events happening around the world that to practice our thinking and make people more development.
8.0	I have a good friend always like to read all the news around the world, in the morning he always buy a newspaper and never give up.
8.0	As this result his mind is more development than other students and he always have good theme to talk about with each other.
8.0	All in all , have a wide field of visionis is very important.
10.0	Second, care about all the bi
3.0	When we are working and studying for a long time, we will feel too tired.
3.0	At this time we need to relax,but there are ways for relax.
3.0	One is to watching a moive or reading a book,the other is doing physical eexercise.
3.0	As for me,I perfer the first one.
3.0	Here are my reasons.
3.0	Firstly,after a long work,our brain under too much stress,so we need to let it feel comfortable.
3.0	Reading a book or watching a movie can let it be.
3.0	To illustrate,lest week,i become very tired after a math test.
3.0	I needed a spirit incentive and a book which i really interesting in over my desk.
3.0	Reading the book feels me so good that seems i swimming in the ocean.
12.0	The soft words touch my heart.
10.0	After that i feel better.
6.0	When we are tied ,the first idea comes to our mind is have a rest,but doing aphysical exercise make our body which is exhausted feel ore tired.
8.0	When we have that ,not only we brain comes too heavy ,but also we have a fatigued truncus.
8.0	The mental problem add the physical problem could makes the peple have some trouble.
8.0	A Finally,watching a movie or reading a book can takes us knowledge that can let us have more ways to solve the problems in work ,that can make the work easily for we and then we can relax more time.
7.0	To sum up all this advantage can us increase in well being in the rest time
7.0	and it's a good way
3.0	As the world is becoming more and more diversified, the content of Movies and television are becoming more and more diversified as well.
3.0	Whenever asked about wether movies and TV have more negative effects than positive effects on young people, people always exhibit an air of uncertainty.
11.0	However, I don't think movies and TV have more negative effects on young people.
4.0	To begin with, young people can be educated more knowledge by TV now.
8.0	Nowadays, there are more and more positive and interesting programs on TV that draws young people's attention.
8.0	And while watching those programs, young people can learn a lot of knowledge as well as broaden their horizons.
8.0	For example, there is a program called Super Brain in China where people have to solve a lot of puzzles including the knowledge of mathmatics, physics, architecture and so on.
8.0	I always watch this program on Friday night after I came home from school.
8.0	It is amazing that I have learned a lot of knowledge that I can not know in class.
8.0	So TV can also influence young people in a positive way now.
4.0	Then, movies and television can educate young people to do good things.
8.0	Everyone can notice that there are more and more public service advertising in movies or on TV now.
8.0	It is not difficult to find that those advertises are filmed in a good way, so they are interestin enough to draw young people's attetion.
8.0	And by watching those advertises, young people will know both what is right to do and what is wrong to do.
8.0	In this way, young children can still be able to learn something useful like the moral code and ways to save themselves.
4.0	Last but not the least, although young people may see something bad in the movies or on television, they have the ability to recognize and ignore those things.
8.0	Nowadays, people pay more attention to education that before, so children are better educated that they are able to recognize bad things and not to learn from those things.
8.0	For example, although my brother watch TV series that the character may smoke cigarattes, but he never tries to do the same thing because he knows that is not cool.
8.0	So I think young people have the ability to not to learn from bad things on TV or in the movies.
2.0	To conclude, I don't agree that TV or movies may have more negative effects on young people.
3.0	As the development of education, there is a problem occuring-should parents let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes?
4.0	This is a nice problem.
9.0	In the past, parents always didn't let their children make mistakes, which might not let them hurted.
9.0	"However, as the saying goes: ""Failure is the mother of success."", and which one is right?"
4.0	Facts prove that by learning from failure can people succeed more easily.
8.0	Let me take an example-Thomas Edison, the father of light, succeeded in inventing bulb after fail to do it 999 times, using more than 1600 heat-resistance materials and 6000 vegetable fibres.
8.0	Faced with the problems and difficulties, Edison didn't give up but summarized all kinds of the failures, which were most important experience in his experiment helping him improve the capability of bulb and finally succeed.
8.0	For him, failure is the mother of success.
8.0	Without these valuable experience, he couldn't have done this.
4.0	Nevertheless, every coin has two sides.
9.0	Is every mistake or failure good to people?
9.0	Can everyone benefit from failures and mistakes?
4.0	For example, parents will never let their children be on the center of the crossroad when the signal lamp is red, will never let their children jump from a high building, will never let their children put their delicate hands in the fire.
10.0	They will be impressive at these disasters and pain, not making the same mistakes, as well as being destroyed by them at the same time.
0.0	Though certainly you can learn from your own mistakes, which makes you more intelligent and more experience, but it must be under the premise of mistakes' not hurting you seriously.
0.0	So, don't believe one-sided words.
0.0	Seek the limit of the boundary and keep in mind that particular case is particular analysis.
3.0	Recently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people: whether government have to guarantee the tourists' safety in the ways of  increasing the number of the police or have to decorate the old buildings to make them look beautiful to attract visitors.
3.0	Opinions vary from people to people.
3.0	Some poeple claim that there is no need for the government to do those things.
3.0	As for me, I wholeheartedly agree that improve tourists' safety and improve the scenic spots appearance can help to appeal more people to visit.
12.0	My points can be elaborated as followed.
5.0	First of all, guranteeing people's safety will play an important role when people choose where to visit.
8.0	As we all know, before desciding the plan of the trip, people must ask a question about the safety around there.
8.0	If there are many accidents happened here, people will not consider to visit there.
8.0	So if the government can turly improve the safety and hire more police to maintain the peace here, tourists are more likely to be impressed by the great public security and wanna to go there.
8.0	Take myself as an example, when I choose a place for my family trip, I will find the level of security there first.
8.0	And every time I saw a scenic spot named Shengnongjia, I felt afriad because I heard that many accidents happened there in the recently year, so I never want to go there to visit.
5.0	In addition, beautiful appearance can also make this place more attractive for people to visit.
8.0	As we all know, many people visit other countries just want to find some exotic beauty to enjoy, and in such a modern day, people form a habitat to take photos everywhere they went, which confirm that beautiful scene is very significant because nobody want to take photos in front of some old and ugly buildings.
8.0	For example, my cousin Jack accidently be chosen to go to visit a remote village named Huangqiao.
8.0	When he came back, he said he will never to visit there again, because the scene there is really bad, and he cannot share a beautiful photo in his SNS.
7.0	To conclude, i agree that the government need to imporve the constr
3.0	While some people prefer to go to a cinema after work to take a rest, others choose to jog along the road instead.
11.0	They both believe that their own way to relax is better.
12.0	However, I prefer the latter one.
11.0	I disagree that it is better to relax emotionally than realx physically.
5.0	Physical exercise can provide people with truly relax while emotional work will let them feel less comfortable.
8.0	Nowadays, people will have a lot of pressure from a whole day's work.
8.0	They may feel tired and sleepy.
8.0	At this time, if they watch a movie, they will get annoyed by the noisy music or awaken by the scaring stories.
8.0	It is not helpful for them to go to sleep later.
8.0	In the same theory, if they read a book, they may feel uncomfortable at their sleepy eyes and they will not be so focused on the book any more.
8.0	So realxing by watching a movie or reading a book is not suggested.
8.0	However, doing some physical exercise will make people energetic to deal with the next period of work.
8.0	It will also help to keep fit.
8.0	Thus, I advise that people should relax by doing exercise rather than by watching a movie or reading a book.
5.0	Besides, realxing physically is a human being's natural action.
8.0	We all know that the most comfotble period of time of a human being is childhood.
8.0	For children, they can not understand what a movie is talking about or what a book is saying.
8.0	All they can enjoy for a whole day is to play games and to chase each other endlessly.
8.0	It is like that in human nature, the best way to relax is based on physical movement but emotional promotion.
8.0	For an adult, we should also follow this natural rule to realx physically after a tiring day's mental work.
2.0	Judging from the reasons provided above, I think it is better to relax by doing physical exercise than realx by watching a movie or reading a book.
11.0	In nowadays, more and more parents like carrying their children to travel somewhere, they think their children can get more knowledge during the traveling.
11.0	In my opinions, I prefer to travel to foreign countries than traveling in my own country.
11.0	I thinks that I can get more beneficial in the foreign countries jounery.
11.0	So I disagree with the statement that people benefit more from traveling in thei own country than from traveling to foreign countries.
4.0	First of all, I think traveling to foreign countries can recognize more different culture.
8.0	I have been to the foregin country named Korea.
8.0	I went there and watched a concert.
8.0	And during the five days in Korea, I know some special culture in Korea.
8.0	For example, in China, the age of girls are secret and it is rude if you ask an woman how old she is.
8.0	But in Korea, it is polite to ask the age of the girl because is important to know whether she is elder than you, and you have to use the exact style of chatting to communicate with her.
4.0	Secondly, traveling to foreign countries can built a new socialize circle.
8.0	We can meet different people in foreign countries and we can know more friends under the intruductions of them.
8.0	It is a easy way to widen our socialize circle.
8.0	When I traveling to Korea, I make friends with some Korean girls, we all like the same bank and we have the same comunication topic.
8.0	Altrough we speak different language but we can talk with others in English.
8.0	After we met each others, we always communicate in Internet.
8.0	And if I want to buy some album in Korea, I can ask them for some help.
8.0	They are kind and they are an important part in my friends circle.
4.0	At last, the foreign countries jounery can help us know some different and interesting diaglet.
9.0	Every area have different diaglet, even in our country, there are lots of different and interesting diaglets.
9.0	We can know some special language and study those languge during the journey in other foreign countries.
2.0	Above all, alhough we can get some unique knowledge in the traveling in our country
3.0	Recently there is a heated discussion regarding which type of friends is better for people to make with.
3.0	Attitudes towards this issue vary from individuals to individuals.
3.0	There is a common conception that it is worth to make friends with intelligent people.
11.0	However, from my perspective, I strongly believe that people should be contact with humor people.
12.0	My view will be explained by analyzing the following reasons.
4.0	One reason why I am in favor of the point is that humor people enable people to deal with problems in an easy way.
8.0	This is largely due to the fact that humor people can help people to get out of nagetive areas and treat issues with positive attitudes.
8.0	Taking myself for example, when I was in middle school, I was so upset because I still fell my math exams even I spent plenty of time on math courses.
8.0	Fortunately, my best friend Jane dicovered my unusual emotions.
8.0	She always told me some jokes which were happened around us.
8.0	After jokes, she would teach me some solutions to deal with my math problems according to her experiences.
8.0	I found that I was willing to accept her suggestions because her jokes relaxed my nervous feelings.
8.0	As a result, I achieved a decend academic record in next math exam.
8.0	As the example shows, humor people allow people to accept their opinions and find an easy way to solve the problems.
4.0	Another reason used to support my opinion is that humor people can lead people to positive emotions when they are confront with troubles.
8.0	This is because humor people always smile at you, and their positive emotions will effect you to be positive as they are.
8.0	Campared with serious people who always remind people what the mistakes they have, humor people do not tell people the problems directly, they will use some ways people can accept by their jokes.
8.0	In additions, people are more willing to make friends with these humor people, because people feel comfortable to stay with them.
4.0	Admittedly, people need to make friends with intelligent people.
8.0	This group of individuals can bring knowledge which people do not understand to abroden people's horizons.
8.0	However, if people can not accept these knowledge, they will ignore those friends.
8.0	Hence, it is not useful for people.
8.0	On the opposite, humor people always have ways to make people feel happy and accept their ideas.
1.0	To sum up, people should make friends with humor people.
1.0	Not only do humor people make problems to be solved easily  but also they can lead tpeople to positive emotions.
3.0	Today, there is a hot topic: whether people in school should cultivate the ability of relating well to people or of studying hard for achieveing success in future career.
3.0	The anwser varies from person to person.
11.0	Some people think that it is more important to relate well to people.
11.0	Contrary their opinion comes my view that it is more essential to study hard in school for succeeding in future career.
5.0	To begin with, studying hard in school improves professional competivity.
8.0	It is acknowledged that students gain professional knowledge by studying, so studying hard which means people spend more time in doing research and accumulating more theories brings competitive expertise to students.
8.0	In this case, competivity that students gain by studying hard will helps them to succeed in the future.
8.0	By contrast,
5.0	Moreover, studying hard in school cultivates students to be persistent which is the common quality of successful people.
9.0	Having a good academic performance is hard, because knowledge are boring and difficult to understand.
9.0	Too many assignments, experiments and courses cause a significant pressure to every student, so students who still study hard under this circumstance during whole education can be more persistent.
2.0	In general, I think it is more important to study hard in school for getting success in the future career.
11.0	I agree that it is important to know about events happening around the world,even if it is unlikely that they will affect your daily life.
11.0	First, I think focusing on the events happing around the world is something we have to do.
11.0	That's a very important thing in our daily life.
12.0	If you know a lot about events happening around world,you will have more topics to talk about with your friends.
11.0	And your friends will feel you have a lot of knowledge and are more willing to talk with you.
11.0	It is also a good way to make friends.
5.0	Second, I think it is not that it doesn't affect your life and you don't have to know it.
8.0	If you know more about it you will have your own idea and you can make an appropriate plan for your future.
8.0	You can see a   clearer future.
8.0	You also can keep up with this world.
5.0	At last,it is also can improve your grades.
8.0	In the progress of understanding is also the process of accumulating material.
8.0	When you teacher asks you to write an argumentative essay,you can write some events happening around the world in your essay.
8.0	I think your teacher will praise you if you use these material.
2.0	So I think it is important to know about events happening around the world.
3.0	At preasent, in an intense competitive sociaty,most of people prefer to work alone rather than join in a groups ,they think it is bnefical for them improve efficiency ,as far as i'm concered,I strongly believe that it is an importan way to improve my work efficiency when I work with others together.
5.0	Firstly,the student could get more motivation and creativity when working together on projects.
10.0	Group of students studies one assign projects could met all kinds of problems,they can get many differert ideals by talking about each other,this behavies not only provide a way to finish assignment,but also cultivate  a spirit of slove problem's ability
5.0	Scendly,It is an essencial element for students improves abilities of communication by working in a group team.
8.0	you would faced many different peers when you work together,If you are shy,you can get more encrouges by others  help you to do this work,and if you are very hummon,that is make you more outgoing when you in a team.
8.0	for instance,my brother--Ben is a very smart boy,but he is affaid to express his mind in public,at once team assignment has totally change him.
8.0	when teacher assign projects ,he can express his own views by classmates' encourage ,and he become outgoing and often help others activity,and make him gets a lot of friends.
12.0	As I see it, I agree with the parents suggest their children money for each high grade they get in school.
12.0	As the social advance become faster and faster, the children have more demands for money, I think this way is good for students to grow up.
5.0	First of all, according to the high grade to direct give children money can encourage their work hard.
8.0	For instants, a student who want to buy a new CD, but he have no enough money to buy it.
8.0	Then, his parents tell he, if he work hard and get a high mark in the exam, they will give he more money to buy what they want.
8.0	After this, the boy not only get a good grade, but also they get more money to buy a new CD.
8.0	"That way can make the children know if he keep good grade, he can buy more things, like Chinese old saying:"" no pains ,no gains."""
8.0	This way can cultivate students keep good habit and work hard.
5.0	Secondly, give the students more money that can make the students cultivate their hobbies.
9.0	For example, when the students get a good grade, and they have more money.
9.0	Childrens can use their money to cultivate their hobbies, such as: play the piano, play sports and buy painting tools.
2.0	All in all, according to the high grade that students get to give them money is more acceptable, which not only can encourage students work hard and keep good habits, but also can culticate their hobbirs.
10.0	This way can bring more benifit for students.
12.0	Many families have children now and the education on this children must be well concerned.
11.0	Some people think that parents should prevent their children from making mistakes, while others argue that it would be useful if children have the chance to experience the process of making mistakes.
11.0	As for me, I do prefer the latter one and there are several reasons I want to name.
5.0	First of all, it is no doubt that we cannot avoid making mistakes in the childhood.
8.0	In comparison to the adults, children are the new members of this world, and the childhood is the period for them to explore the whole world and various new things.
8.0	In this process, the children have no experiences before so that they are bound to make mistakes when encountering a new situation.
8.0	However, even adults are making a great variety of mistakes in their daily life.
8.0	If we are unable to overcome mistake-making by ourselves, how can we desire it to take place on the children?
8.0	Because none of us is a sage, everyone could make mistakes.
8.0	We must be open-minded toward making mistakes.
5.0	Moreover, children can learn a lot from their mistakes.
8.0	Once a child makes a mistake, there have to be something that he confuses about or have a wrong understanding on.
8.0	These are what we need to make clear for the children.
8.0	We can aid them in establishing their own values as well as help them distinguish right things from the wrong ones.
8.0	It is significant for the children to make their way towards success through mistake-solving.
8.0	For instance, Jack Ma is now the richest people in China, who has found Alibaba group.
8.0	However, when he was a young boy, he failed the entrance exam for the university for three times.
8.0	Even after he founded Alibaba, the business was disappointing and could not make any profits at all.
8.0	But Jack Ma performed a surprising ability of persistence.
8.0	He not only continued his study and finally succeeded to enter the university, but also got the chance to transfer to the United States, where he found his niche in the internet market.
8.0	His persistence lasted throughout his business and make hime become a successful businessman.
1.0	In conclusion, making mistakes is inevitable for everyone, besides the children.
1.0	We should make a full use of the process when we are dealing with the mistakes with the children, instead of simply prohibiting them from making mistakes.
3.0	Nowadays individuals make efforts to achieve their goals, and it seemly become a frequent phenomenon with the develping of our social.
12.0	Some people hold the view that do a favor to these kind of struggling strangers make them be succesful more faster,and others think there have no need to help strangers because no one can achieve their goals to luckily, helping them have no benifit from them.
11.0	As far as I‘m concerend, it's very useful the strangers give help to others.
6.0	Firstly,in general someone who are wiiling to help others can also gain the good quality from the strangers.
8.0	The struggling people always have some good qualities just like persistance, patience,confidence.....
8.0	This kind of quality always dirve them in working and in their life.，if they aquire more helps from others,they would very appriciate it and more spacific to do someting to achieve their golas.
8.0	The helpers not only learn about the difficulty of successful,they also bring reputation once their  heop.
10.0	Secondly, d
12.0	Some parents give their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school, the rewords is shown in different circumstances which have pasitive effect on motivitionof the children to gain the good grade, at least in some way.
8.0	I do agree that gives the children little rewords for what they did is a good tactics to keep childrens motivated, but it may has some drowbacks.
8.0	At first I want to point out that the study is children's own bussness, it's very important thato indicate the significant role of the study and what influence it will cause if you are not will educated.
8.0	I think that is more important than the good grade obtain by the well behiever children.
8.0	that principal need to be acquened by the children.
8.0	second I think what we give children as a reword is also important.
8.0	I think the rewords can be more variety that you think, a trip with family maybe more efficent that just handed over a 20 doller.
8.0	Is important to imply to children the role of the money in everyday lifes.
8.0	money is important, you don't have it, you can do nothing, but you have money you can't do anything.
8.0	You can't buy happiness, quality time with family or more important thinks than money I suppose.
8.0	So if you don't want to your chiuldren endded up all they care about is the reword that they recive after good work and only care about how much money that they recived you better thinks twise before you process it.
8.0	The children is pure when they were burn so make sure the children turn out healthy mentally and physically, that is the most important think, it's better that you kids didn't become a pioneer at science field than become a psychopath.
11.0	Many people would say that relax by doing physical exercise because it can relax people's body.
11.0	I agree that in some case doing sports are good for health.
12.0	After all, when I was doing my homework for a long time,  I would walk for a while then I will felt better.
12.0	However, in my opinion,relax by watching a movie or reading a book is better.
5.0	Firstly,relax by watching a movie or reading a book can relax our mind.
8.0	After a lot of work, we may feel stress out.
8.0	At that time, the most tired part of our body is our mind.
8.0	At this time we can watch a movie to relax.
8.0	Last time, I have a big project for my history class which need to be finished in one day.
8.0	I focusd on that project for very long time.
8.0	Finally I finished.
8.0	I felt lots of stress.
8.0	I started to watch a movie that it was comedy.
8.0	It made my laugh.
8.0	During the time I was watching the movie I felt relax.
8.0	Then I forgot all the bad thing.
8.0	Watching movie is a good way to relax.
5.0	Secondly, when we are watching a movie or reading a book we can learn somethings from it.
8.0	Books are full of knownedges.
8.0	After so much thought, we felt tired.
8.0	For example, when I finished my math homework, I felt tired.
8.0	It was really hard.
8.0	After that  I read a book.
8.0	It talked about math in a interesting way.
8.0	I like that book.
8.0	I found that I can sovled my math problem in another way.
8.0	And it was easier, then I change the way to do it.
8.0	I have learned a lot from the book.
8.0	And also make me relaxed.
2.0	To sum up, wherease there is an argument for relax by doing phsical exercise, namely good for health,relaxing our mind, coupled with learning some new thing from the movie or the book, make a strong case for relax by watching a movie or reading a book.
12.0	As the world has changed tremendously in the past fifty years, a discussion on if the advice provided by our grandparents can be useful has provoked widely attention in society.
11.0	Some people believes that some advice can be still useful, while others think that advice can be outdated.
12.0	In my opinionm, I prefer the former one.
5.0	Firstly, some wisdom don't get antiquated when the time flies.
8.0	That's why we still have some history class to observe what the historical figures did when they faced some specific problems and absorbs the experience to apply that knowledge into practice in mordern life.
8.0	For example, my grandfather always tell me to be humble which keep in my heart.
8.0	When I worked in the security company as an internship, I always talked gentlely to others and when someone asked me some question, I always answered that question elaborately and patiently.
8.0	Eventually, that humble behaviour left a great impression on the manager.
8.0	So I got the return offer easily.
5.0	Secondly, the advice given by the grandparents are always the lesson they have experienced.
8.0	Since you may live in the same country and live with the same culture with your grandparents, this suggestion can be especially helpful to you.
8.0	For instance my grandmother has told me that I should keep a good relationship with someone I value.
8.0	So I practice the interpersonal skill from the primary school, which help me extend my social network efficiently.
8.0	Whenever I have some problems, I always share with my friends.
8.0	they are also willing to give me some helpful advice.
12.0	"Lin Yutang, the famous Chinese writer have said ""when a person come to the world, their inners are totally same ""."
11.0	But nowadays, many people believe that leadership comes naturally and can not be learned.
11.0	That is a very nagetive thought, and I do not think it is ture.
5.0	At first, many great leader was not good at leading people when they are young.
8.0	If leadship come naturaly, a leader must always be a leader no matter how old he is.
8.0	But it is very common for a great leader develop his leadship as he gets older.
8.0	For example, we all know Lincoln, the great leader in unit state of American.
8.0	He has worked as a lawer for more tham ten years, and people who worked with him could not see any leadship from him.
8.0	But Lincoin is surly have great leadship when he became the chiarman of U.S.
8.0	So the only way to expain it is that he learned how to be a lead when he working as a lawer.
8.0	And during dealing with people who had law problems, Lincoln began to know how to lead people.
8.0	So leadship is a kind of skill, just like riding  bike or swimming, that people can learn how to do that during their lives.
5.0	On the other hand, leadship is not a single ability.
8.0	Leadship means warm-hearted, selfless, fair and many other  characteristics.
8.0	So a person can have leadship when he has all these characteristics.
2.0	And all of these characteristics can be learned in our daily lives.
8.0	For examplel,
3.0	Nowadays,many parents will give their school-age children pocket money based on their behaviors in exams.
11.0	However,I don't agree with this condition.
5.0	First of all, conect school marks with pocket money may make children be an utilitarian, and they may study just for more money rather than gaining knowledge and improving themselves.
5.0	Secondly, these children may set up their aims of earning more money so that they may not know what to do after they graduate.
8.0	As an result, they will loose the chance to develop their interest of future career and finally cannot adapt the fierce society competition.
8.0	There is an example of my cousin Mike,when he was a school-age child, his parents promised to give him more money if he could get higher scores in the exams.
8.0	So that Mike started to learn very hard and he thought learning knowledge is just for more pocket money.
8.0	After he graduated, he did not know what he can do in the society, he soon failed to compete with his peers and cannot adapt himself to the society.
10.0	Thirdly, giving more money when getting more scores in exams may let children use all of their spare time to prepare for the exams, thus they may have no time to play or do some sport, so it may do harm to their mental and physical health.
2.0	All in all,I don't think associate learning knowledge with pocket money is good to school-age children's growth, and it will eventually let the children be an utilitarian, feel hard to win the society competition and be unhealthy.
3.0	The news related to entertainers and atheles usually draw lots of people's attention, and sometimes their privacy is seriously affected.
11.0	Thus, as far as I am concerned, they deserve to have more privacy than they have now.
5.0	First and foremost, everyone possesses their own right of privacy, which is not supposed to be offended readily.
8.0	That is because everyone including those celebrities has the desire to lead their own lives.
8.0	However, if all of their actions are exposed to the public, this will deprive their freedom thoroughly, which is obviously unfair for them.
8.0	I have a case to aptly illustrate my point.
8.0	Zhou Jielun is my favorite singer.
8.0	I can read some news on the internet about him frequently, just like his fans found him had a meal with someone in a restaurant.
8.0	You can see his daily life is totally supervised by the public, which is apparently unconvenient for him.
5.0	Moreover, offering them more privacy is also benificial for their family members.
10.0	That is because their relativities may simply want to enjoy a normal live which has no difference with others'.
7.0	However if the relationship between them is revealed to the public, this will in
3.0	With the development of the social,contemporary parents are more concentrate on education of their school-age children.
12.0	But some measures that they take to encourage children are not always fit children who are immaturity.
10.0	The motivation from money is a very example that has possibility to have purpose of narration with too much utility.
5.0	First of all, offering money to encourage children for high grad can actually make them have more impetus to learn.
8.0	It also can establish a concept that  the goal what they make great efforts for only is money when they don't have a specific view of value.
8.0	It's known of all that we work hard is not only for money or get a well-paid position but also  for more knowledges to strenth ourselves to achieve our target.
8.0	The targets of us are achieve the more personal value rather than money.
8.0	Encourage children only by money simply make children regard the signification of studying is only for money.
5.0	On the other hand,children always don't have enough ability to use money rationally.
7.0	Extremly parents often offer so much money for a good mark to attain a efficien
12.0	Helping the struggling strangers is a kind of good manners that deserves to be adevocated by us.
11.0	Additionally, as far as I am concerned, nowadays people are more willing to help thoes strangers who are in need than before.
12.0	My reasons and examples for this point are listed as follows.
5.0	First and foremost, the transition of education idea encourages us to assist those strangers.
8.0	In the past, school attach too much importance to the students' academic performance and neglact their value formation.
8.0	However, in current society, people pay more attention to students' comprehensive development, making them concerned about others' need and do something for them.
8.0	My own experience can be salient example for my point.
8.0	When I was in elementary school, what my teacher always told us was that we were supposed to aid those people who needed help, which could show our genorosity.
8.0	Thus, sometimes I found others in trouble like missing their road, I was happy to give them my guidance.
5.0	What is more, people now possess stronger ability to help others.
8.0	Formerly, due to limited financial ability, it was hard for people to sustain their own lives, let alone aid others.
8.0	One the contrast, nowadays, people are rendered the capability to help others according to their will.
8.0	I have a case to aptly illustrate my point.
8.0	When I was a child, my parents sometimes gave me pocket money.
8.0	I not only used the money to buy the books I loved, but also donate part of it to the charity to help those people I was not faimliar with at all.
7.0	Admittedly, curently, some people are self-centered and selfish due to the
3.0	It is universally acknowleged that with the rapid development of the technology, the overall society has become more and more properous.
3.0	However, we can never deny the fact that technology establishes a huge barrier between people's daily communication.
3.0	Thus, people today usually casts doubt on their collegues or friends, let alone the struggling strangers.
12.0	The reasons in details are stated in the followings.
5.0	First of all, it is common that people receive the fake information or phone calls that ask for help.
8.0	Such kind of deceiving is so common that people nowadays no longer have the willingness to help the strangers.
8.0	For example, one of my roomates got to the subway some day, a stranger approached her and ask her for some money to call a taxi.
8.0	Out of courtesy, she helped the stranger as well as she could and gave the stranger enough money for him to go home.
8.0	To her surprise, although the stranger have promised to return the money, she never received the money.
8.0	From the story above, we can tell that when the trust between people generally fade, we will never willing to help the stuggling strangers anymore.
5.0	"From another aspect, an increasing number of people, especially the elders, plot an ""accident"" to get a large amount of money illegally."
9.0	Recently, a news has been reported that a teenager helped a struggling old man to walk properly.
9.0	Normally, this teenager should be praised for his behavior, nevertheless, he was tricked and had to pay almost a million for the old man's treatment.
2.0	From what has discussed above, it is obvious that we can draw the conclusion that people today are more reluctant to help the struggling strangers, not only because the disappering trust, but also for the vile people who want to break the world as well.
3.0	Nowodays, everyone is possible to possess their model of a famous star such as Lebron James and Jackie Chan.
3.0	Frankly speaking, it would not be a surprise when you acquire the information of their anecdotes like who had divorced.
3.0	It's likely that scores of people make comments that the social circles of famous entertainers and atheletes are in a mess, but why not consider in an different angle?
3.0	Despite the fact that those celebrities are of course ordinary citizens, why is their privacy offesed in an increadable times?
11.0	In my point of view, it's necessary that they should possess more privacy.
6.0	Firstly, the entertainers should not live anxious life and be influenced owing to the anecdotes revealed on the Internet.
8.0	It's known to us all that science and technology are developing in an imaginative speed.
8.0	And because of this, more anecdotes could be acquired with some modern devices and relevant people.
8.0	"If the entertainers heard of punishment of theri fans about the  truth that has been released to the public, they must own a feeling of guilty together with angry about the ""reporters""."
8.0	It's just like of of their possessions are robbed by other people.
8.0	Therefore, they could not be concentrated on the plays or the movies, thus behave very badly, which then will give rise to deeper disicipline by their original supporter.
2.0	Next, the entertainments of the athletes should be regarded as not thinking hi9ghly of their teams and matches.
7.0	Some players that have strong self- control and confidence can somehow get rid of the impact of the terrible news that
11.0	in my opinion,parents shouldn't offer their school-age children money for high grade they get in school.
12.0	here are the reasons.
12.0	instead of encourage the kids,i'd rather say that this kind of behavior is just like feeding the animals.
11.0	As a child,what he needs to learn is not to get paid or rewards by working hard,for the reson that hardworking dosen't always mean we can get what we want.
9.0	Our childs must know that even they can get nothing from the things they're doing,they should also do a nice work,that's how the world works.
9.0	But animals don't know that.
6.0	what's more,as a parent,we are not supposed to just give our children money without telling them how to use the money properly.
8.0	Some childs don't have the concept of having money,they don't know what they can do with it.
8.0	And that may leads to something really bad.
8.0	They may get robbed in the school,which is both sad for him and the money.
8.0	Some childs may even get cheated by those bad friends,and by then,its too late to regret having given them so many money.
8.0	Once there was a time,I've got an A in my final exam,and my parents gave me 100￥to buy something i like.
8.0	Unfortunelly,i was  robbed by those bad boys after school.
8.0	I am so scary to tell my parents,and away fly the money.
8.0	Trust me,that feeling was not good.
2.0	If my child got very high grade in the exams.
9.0	I'd buy the books he or she wanted rather than giving them money,knowledge is better than money.
9.0	And after all,spended money is safer than money  has not been spent yet.
11.0	Money is very crucial in our life, the same is true for the children.
12.0	Some people think that young children don't need  to learn to manage their own money, because young children too young to control very good for  their money.
11.0	However, some people claim that young children should learn how to use their own money wisely, because it is beneficial for their furture when their have own money.
11.0	Personally, I believe that the children that very young, they need to learn how to mange their own money, because it can praticle for they become an adults.
5.0	To begin with, mange their own money for their, which is a practicle.
8.0	For example, when they have 100 yuan, and they need to buy 5 book for their math class, but a toy that they really want to buy.
8.0	In that time, they need to choose one between two things.
8.0	If let them learn how to manage their own meny, they will chose the book rather than toy, because they must chose the thing that they really need to buy.
8.0	The toy can wait next time to buy.
8.0	If don't let them to manage their own money, they maybe will let parents buy a toy to them, not the book.
5.0	Secodly, let children to plan their money, they will know how to save money.
8.0	For instance, if parents don't let chilren to manage their own money, they will want to buy something when they like the product.
8.0	If their parents do not allow, they will cry.
8.0	However, if give money for their own, they will plan the money that to used.
8.0	Sometimes, they will save money for next time to used, because if last time parents give money to them,they spent over.
8.0	If children want to buy a pen or other things, they have not enough money.
8.0	This way will let them know money need use in important thing.
1.0	Lastly, become an adults, you must to learn manege your own money.
1.0	For example, if you learn early, yo All in all, I believe that young children should to learn how to manage their own money, because it is a practicle for they become adults.
3.0	As the study style has beacome a definitely personal choice, it has been on highly debatble this days.
12.0	Which type of leaning style is more effective.
12.0	Some people assert that working alone can help them to concentrate and can complete the task more quickly.
11.0	However, in my opion I dont't think this is the best choice, study alone can't really help us learn more knowledge,  the reasons are as follows.
5.0	First of all, working together can be benifit for information collecting and can reduce the wasting time in  searching information.
8.0	As working in a group can directly helps to work on different task project, we can seperate the task to the study group and before the deadline organizing a disscusion to collect all the knowledge that are needed.
8.0	For instance, in my history class, the teacher asked us to prepare for the time line for the Foundation of Community.
8.0	This would be a tons of work, no one can do this job precisely and quickly, therefore we made this homework in group.
8.0	All we need to do is to focus on our own task, so we all tried our best.
8.0	Then we communicate with others and exchange the ideas, we all get a great job in the end.
8.0	In this way, working together can sometimes save time and be more effective.
5.0	Moreover, Only we communicate with others we can find our own problems.
8.0	If we study alone and don't share our ideas, we can never know what is our true problems.
8.0	Like my cousin, when he was in his math class, he did his homework for A plus, all his result is correct, but when he talk to others about the method that he used in one problem, he found out all he analys were wrong even though he got the correct answer.
8.0	Since, it is really significant for us to work together to communicate and exchange our opinion to look for our problems that we can't find by ourselves.
0.0	According to what I have concerned, working alone might not only get us away from distraction and make us pay attetion on the task we are doing at.
0.0	but also stimulate us to work independently.
0.0	whereas only we share our ideas and communicate with others we can effectively find out our problems and enjoy the time when we share our opinions.
3.0	These days, thanks to development of technologies, there is a wide variety of jobs related to handle these technologies.
3.0	While in the past the number of jobs related to handle these technologies.
3.0	While in the past the number of jobs was very small and people faced with limitations to find suitable jobs.
3.0	So they had to follow their parents' career and tried to develop it.
10.0	I personally disagree with this statement that children should choose certain jobs that are simillar to their parents' jobs now.
12.0	Following reasons and examples prove my approach.
4.0	By advent of technologies, the abilities and skills of children are higher than those of parents so they should select certain jobs to fulfill their ability.
8.0	For instance, these days, the most proportion of kids is struggling with computer and they have lots of information about computer literacy.
8.0	In contrast, the parents do not have enough knowledge about computer and its application.
8.0	It is clear that children as a future generation shouldimprove their position and choose suitable jobs that are related to this technology.
4.0	Furthermore, parents should respect to the interest of their children and allow them to select it even their parents were very successful people at that job.
9.0	For instance, there is a man's uncle in a story, his uncle did not like to follow his uncle's father job and be a farmer but because of availability of farmlands and suitable equipment, he enforced to continue his father job.
9.0	By passing years he failed and lost his capital due to lack of interest although his father was one of teh successful farmers at that area.
4.0	In addition, when children have different jobs from their parents' jobs, they can be more independent with high confidence because they can prove their ability to their family in a different way.
9.0	As an example, you can imagine someone whose parents are carpenter with big workshop.
9.0	While he is a successful computer programmer with high confidence because he follows his interest and could achieve his goals which could never happen if he wanted to choose his parents; vocation.
10.0	In conclusion, I personally think thatchildr
3.0	When it comes to relax,different people have different opinions.
11.0	Some prefer to relax by watching a movie while others are willing to take physical exercise.
11.0	However,what I want to say is that it is the purpose rather than approach that matters.
9.0	That is to say,there are certain considerations or factors that everyone takes into account.
9.0	What they want is just relax.
5.0	First,what peope prefer to depends on their interets,and interets may change according to the reality.
8.0	For example,one of books becomes very prevalent because of its construction,idea,and humorous sentences.
8.0	In order to catch the popularity,people exactly prefer to reading it to relax.
8.0	This is also can be proves when it comes to a popular physical exercise.
5.0	Second,people choose different ways due to their spare time.
8.0	Think about it,people finish their office-work at about 5:00pm,however, they have many other things to deal with after they are back to home.
8.0	They have to have dinner and relax only within 3 hours,do they really matters how they relax?
8.0	I don't think so.
8.0	That means,people have to make a accurate schadule to kill the time to relax,no matter by reading or doing exercise.
8.0	The third factor people have to consider is that how much the relax cost.
7.0	We can take exercise at gym,this may spend a lot of money,while re
3.0	Nowadays, people almostly spend their all time on work.
3.0	A excellent attribution of tasks plays an important role in people's work life.
3.0	Some people think that workers will more satisfied when they do same tasks all the day.
3.0	However, I stronly disagree with this point.
12.0	Getting different tasks is the best choice for workers.
4.0	All of these two events have their own benefits.
8.0	Worker just do same tasks can help them improving concentration maybe.
8.0	Take my brother as an instance.
8.0	My brother, Tom, he is major in computer science and he work in a big company when he graduate.
8.0	H just whrites online application all the day.
8.0	I usully ask him if he feel boring but he told me sometimes we can achieve our goal when we specialize on one things.
8.0	At finnal, he achieves their goal that he create his own games.
8.0	However, I still suppot my opinion that workers prefer doing different works in their workday.
4.0	Firstly, attributing time for different tasks can improve my time-management ability.
8.0	To be specifical.
8.0	When I work in a computer company, I just write documents per day.
8.0	Due to the point that my work is always, I never do plan on my workload.
8.0	When I switch to another apartment.
8.0	I not only should write documents, but also I need to organize the company meetings.
8.0	Then, at the begining of one day, I list all the things I need to do and its time due to the tasks are highly sophisticated and I should to avoid forgetting its, which improves my ability to attribute time.
8.0	I am confident that I can achieve my goal at future.
4.0	Secondly, coping with different tasks can improve worker's efficiency.
8.0	People will fee highly boring if they just do similar work.
8.0	Therefor, they should to do some changes in the work tasks.
8.0	For instance, befor the final examination.
8.0	I should to prepare for the exam.
8.0	When I spend one-day time to study mathemetics, I find that my efficiency is very low due to the point that my brain is tired for one aspect knowledge.
8.0	Then I study six subject at one time, my brain is very fresh and my efficiency is improved.
2.0	To summerize, doing different works not only can improve worker's efficiency but also can improve people's time management ability.
12.0	In today's high speeding society,more and more people turn to watch a movie for relax,ignoring those primary happiness we gain from books,explaining that it wastes too much time for reading and they will lose their patience gradually if they sit there still.
12.0	There is no doubt that the movie has great charming in our life,and we can also learn a lot of knowledge in these movie,even having more efficency to gain those details.
12.0	However,I still believe that books are the best parterner in our free time.
6.0	To better account for my point of view,I'd like tocite my own experience.
8.0	When I first stepped into the college,I'm so tired of those new coming trouble,leaving a exhausted body in the dormitory.
8.0	All I wanted is to relax,then I began to watch movies,some interesting vedios,lost in them step by step.
8.0	While as time went by,I found that I couldn't catch up with my learning tasks.
8.0	What worse is that I had less time for studying!
8.0	Irriable and upset,I turned to my chemical teacher for help.
2.0	Having heard my confusion,he pointed out that it was I haven't used my time adequately that I went to this point.
8.0	After a long talk I understood that those moives can make us happy,stimulate our organ,even have some use for our knowledge,but it turns out to be one-side and plain.
8.0	Then, I set out to read book.
8.0	an   As I have said above,we  can safely draw a conclusion that read a book can make a better influence than those movies.
8.0	Let's make a good habit to read book together!
3.0	As a child, do you want your parents who have little time to company with you have funny games or sports with you or do things together that are related to schoolwork?
12.0	Obsolutely, most of the children hope their parents to play games or sports with them more, because doing things related to schoolwork is more boring than playing, and most of the children would like to spend a interesting time with their parents.
12.0	Therefore, I endorse that parents should playing games or sports with children in their limited time.
5.0	First, doing sports or having fun games can let children get away from the daily grind in a short time.
8.0	Nowadays, children's school life is full of pressure, they need to cope with the relationship among peers and they have to pay high attention to the classes.
8.0	When they get home, they still have to finish the schoolwork.
8.0	Their parents have limited time to care about their psychology and happiness.
8.0	So if they have time, they should make their children happy, or get rid of those worried things in such a short time.
8.0	Finally, it would form an eternel memory that they have a so relaxed time with their parents.
5.0	In addition, having fun playing games or sports is a wonderful opportunity for parents to teach their children the lesson of life  which is more important than academic performance.
9.0	Take the climbing montain as an example, parents could not only teach their children how to feel less exausted during the process, but also instill the mindset that they should have tenacity to everything.
9.0	Then in the future road of their children, they would think in terms of doing thing until it finished rather than give it up easily.
7.0	Finally, although finishing schoolwork can help them to reduce pressure form school work, they need to finish it in
11.0	Nowdays, more and more parents offer money for thier kids who leran in the school if thier children gain high marks.
11.0	Some pepole agree with it, they think this way can encourge thier kids to get higher grades.
11.0	However, another people disagree with it thier believe that once parents give money to thier kids, our children will pay more attention to the cash, rather thier study.
11.0	Our children will lose the happiness from learning knowledge.
6.0	In my opinion, I believe that students learn knowledge and gain high marks only for themself rather thier parents.
8.0	As a college student, I have to say the reason taht our parents can provide us life or give us money is not we gain the high marks, our parents love us, so they can offer something to thier kids.
8.0	Every parents both hope thier kids live a better life, but they will be olger with the time goes by, we can't depend on our parents in whole life, wo learn knowledge only for us.
8.0	In the future we will hvae our own kids and do same things as our parents.
2.0	If the students consider thier parents, and they will know the mind of thier parents, they will study hard by themself, no matter thier parents offer ot not offer money for them when they get a high marks in school.
10.0	I always bring a idea that every one can do the best in thier study if they pay more and more attention to learning, and never give up in study.
7.0	That's why I disagree with some parents offer thier-age children money for each
3.0	Nowaday, we are having a economic's world which means the money is more and more important in the past.
11.0	So that it is important to do a great job on your work.
12.0	Current works almostly are offical, and there is a idea has been arged for a long time, which is woekers are more satifies when they have many different types of tasks to do during the worday than when they do similar tasks all day long.
11.0	I totally disagree with this opinion, and I will give you two main points to wupports my opinion.
5.0	Firstly, according to the worker's, thus they donot have enough time or patient to face amny new things.
8.0	They are came here for work, at the begining they are not for fun.
8.0	And they are not expect to collect more experience.
8.0	The reason for why they came to work is they need money.
8.0	If they have same tasks every day, they will not need to spend a lot of them patient or emotions.
8.0	If they have diffirent types of tasks to do during the worday, they will need spend more times to think about how to fix it.
8.0	To compare with spend a little time to earn the same money or spend a lot of time to earn the same money, obviously the first one is better.
5.0	Secondly, by doing similar tasks all day long you can develop your skills in this area.
8.0	For instance, I have been played piano for 10 years.
8.0	And now I can play the music beautifully, and compare to the past.
8.0	At the beginning, I think it is difficult to pay one short song, but after I practice it a lot I have my own way to pay music perfectly.
8.0	During you do the same tasks, you can grow during you finish it all the time.
8.0	You also may have a conclusion about how can you do better next time.
8.0	It is a good way to study deeper in area, and it is  also easy to raise your company's status at the same time.
2.0	In conclusion, when workers doing same tasks it will help them relax and imprving their skills.
11.0	The development of career life produce an issue that whether workers are more satisfied when they do different work or do similar things all day along.
12.0	Some people may agree that the repeatable work reduce the stress about the workers.
12.0	In my opinion,Having different types of work gives a priorty to having the similar tasks in the workers satisfaction.
4.0	Firstly,similar task in the workday make workers feel boring about the work.
8.0	For instance,When I was in the high school,instead of doing all the math homework at a workday,I always did different subjects homework in oneday.
8.0	Hence doing a single subject homework easily make me feel exausted and be rejective to the tasks.
8.0	As a result, accessing to differents contents stimulate our activations to the unwilling work.
8.0	In this way,workers are highly motivated about the tasks.
4.0	secondly,having many different types of tasks is a great way to broaden their comprehensive ability.
8.0	Changing different tasks in daliy work means to face different challenge in the career.
8.0	Compared with workes only doing the same thing all the day,this type of the workers have more opportunities to know much more informations in their own area.
8.0	Thus,they can improve their capcity more rapidly and have a more splendid future in their career.
8.0	In summary,The benifits workers gain help them feel the futher satisfied.
4.0	In additional ,the repeatable work let the workers less stressful in work.
8.0	After doing the similar tasks all day,you must be familiar to the work.
8.0	Therefore,you speed at the work and the complishment at the work will be extremly excellent.
8.0	It a simple way that you can pay little in work but reward both your boss and yourselfs,satification.
2.0	Taking all the evidences above,we can naturally arrive to the conclusion that though the less stressful work way pleased the workers,the more complex work way will stimulate our motivations and improve our comprhensive konwledge edd
3.0	All of us will meet a lot of people in our daily life.
3.0	But for students,they are mainly surrounded by teachers and their friends.
3.0	Both of these two kinds of people have great influence on studens.
11.0	However, I still hold the opinion that friends have greater influence on students than teachers do.
4.0	Usually a students and his friends are almost at the same age,or at least they have similar age.
8.0	Therefore,they will have a lot of in common,such as hobbies.
8.0	As a consequence,they can talk to each other and imitate each other's behavior easily.
8.0	My best friend and I areboth interested in one paticular singer and we spent almost all our spare time listening to his music as well as communicating with eath other about our thoughts above his new look or new albums.
8.0	As a reasult,my friends and I better at appreiating the music,espeially teenager pop music.
8.0	Meanwhile,a teacher won't have such influence on s student since they have less in common with us and they only spend time with us during the class.
4.0	Morever,in most schools in my hometown,the teachers just stans in front of the students and give a long speech or lecture to them when there is a class,but after that,they will leave the classroom as soon as possible when the class is over.
8.0	There is no way for the teachers to talk with students in such a limited time period.
8.0	Even if they grab the time luckily to communicate with thier teachers,subjects and homeworks in school will always rank high over any other topics.
8.0	As for me,I could prefer to spend a whole day hanging out with my friends talking some topics we both enjoy rather than talking to my teachers about some boring and diffcult questions.
4.0	Additonally,an everlasting friend will be there for us for a long time.
8.0	Whenever I need help,this kind of friend will come to me immediately.
8.0	On the contrary,teachers sledom stay with us always and forever.
8.0	They won't have as great influence in the long run in our lifeime as our friends do.
2.0	To sum up,though I have to admit that teachers give us oppotunities to gain knowledge and make a great influence on us.
10.0	BUt
12.0	Nowadays, the young generation is confronted with a situation that it's to choose jobs that are similar to their parents or to choose a job that are quite different from their parents'.
12.0	Some think choose a job that is differeent from their parents can broaden their horizen and also can search for new possibility because parents' job may not be that hopeful as before.
11.0	However, from my point of view, i will choose a job that is related to what my parents have done before.
12.0	There are many advantages to be discussed.
5.0	First,choosing a similar job of parents, the parents can pass on the experiences which is professional and in detailed forms.
8.0	After graduation, if we choose a job that we are not familiar with, we might just do  some basic task sent by the leader after a long time, and eventually will not be improved that much in our working skills.
8.0	But under the instruction of our parents, we can easily master the essence of the related skills, because they will never cheat and lazy to cultivate their child .
8.0	In this way, we can be accustomed to our job and explore the new technology or skills and even we be promoted as soon as possible.
5.0	Second, our parents can assist us to extend our business cycle by choosing a similar jobs.
8.0	Our parents having worked for 30  to 40 years, which makes them has more human resource.
8.0	if we have difficulty in seeking financial support or material support, ask our parents for help and they can give us a variety of constructive suggestions.
8.0	Take myself for example, after graduation, i wanted  search for a good salary job, but things do not go like what i had imagined, because i didn't  know much people and much more imformation about some good job in such a big and strange city.
8.0	After calling my father , he told me he has one friend running a compony in Wuhan.
8.0	So i easily find a goog job now and no need to search in different website and run aroung Wuhan under the big sun and in cold weather.
0.0	Thirdly, finding a job simialr to pur parents can result in a closer relationship between our parents and us.
0.0	Currently, because of the rapid change of the world, it become more difficult for our parents to understand us when our parents is aging and we are growing up.
0.0	The generation gap is becoming wide and wide.
7.0	bu
12.0	I disagree with this view.
11.0	As everyone know, our society is improving and the information transportation ways are more and more.
11.0	The information can be easier transformed than past times.
11.0	However, as the use of the computer more and more universal, many computer games are apeared on computer and many children like playing them.
8.0	And palying games always cost much time.
8.0	Though it  difficulte to limit the desire of children playing games, there are also some benefit that educating children in nowadays.
8.0	Let me list three reasons.
5.0	First,I have to say that it is really difficult to limitb the desire of  our childre to play games,though this games had took too much time from their study time.
8.0	Because computer games have many ways to make childs fun.
8.0	For boys,there are many FPS shooting games and Moba games which are very stimulus and funny.
8.0	For girls, there are many dresing games which can make their favorate clohes.
8.0	These games always control the desire of the students, and this impact the education of the children.
5.0	However,computers and cell phones are not good for nothing.
9.0	Because nowadays the information can be transformed in a very fast way, childres can get many knowledges than past times.
9.0	They can learn surviing skills on the internet, they can know many conmunicating skills by working on socirty conmnicating apps, and they can also learn many professional knowledges in a quick and easy way,just to put a button.
10.0	So,
3.0	Since we grow old and then get into school, our parents and techers have taught us to offer help for those who in need.
3.0	And for over and over time, we have leaned or been familiar with a lot of stories which tell a person enjoys helping others and gets a lot of fun in turn.
3.0	Not for any rewardings or fame, just as to achieve their self-worth.
3.0	How elegant and noble a person is if he is always willing to help the struggling strangers!
5.0	However, conversly, in our societies, poeple tend to become much more inconcerned.
8.0	They are not willing to offer help for people in need, especially those who are strangers to them.
8.0	In their mind, they are not friends or not familiar with them, and any kinds of help would not give a reward.
8.0	Thus, would anyone like to give any help?
8.0	Even worsely, some people may deliberatly just fell down before a car on read, pretending that they have been crashed by the driver and compensate for their losses.
8.0	These things happened to old mans at first, and spread to almost every ages of people.
8.0	No matter how old they are, young or old, such behavour have had a  negtive influence on our society and nowadays, people are not willing to help the struggling strangers.
5.0	I am not glad with such a phenomenon and I think that everyone feel sorrow with these behavours just as me.
8.0	Such things should not happen anymore.
8.0	Not only adminstrators of the city but also our every citizens should take actions to prevent the thoughts and immoral behavours.
8.0	The government should use new technologies to recognize the behavioues and enact new laws to punish those who are deliberatly and cheating for a compensate.
8.0	And we ordinanry people should clear our eyes and stand by justice, condemning those persons and let them not dare to cheat any more.
7.0	We should keep in mind that helping is a moral and we should help those in need, nomatter they are friends or struggling strangers
12.0	Some people may think that it's good to give children some prize once they get high grade because this in a way can stimulate kids to work harder.
8.0	But I don't think parents should offer their school-age kids money for each high mark they get in school.
8.0	School is a place to get knowledge and test is a way to see how many things kids have gained.
8.0	Children should focus on study itself rather than what they could get if they studied well.
8.0	When a child get a high grade the first time he took part in an exam, he might happily go home and share the good news with his parents and the parents are proud of their son so they give him some money as prize.
8.0	Then the kid might keep it in mind that if I work harder and get higher grades, he can more present from his parents.
8.0	It seems to be nice that the kid pay more attention to study and can always get high grades but in my opinion, this is totally wrong, it against the purpose of education.
8.0	The true purpose of education is to stimulate the creativity and the passions of the student's body.
8.0	So we need to focus on what we've learned instead of the mark we gain in the exam.
8.0	Parents offer some money because they want their kids to behave better.
8.0	But I want to say that children should study for their future rather than a good job to make more mon
7.0	To be honest,I dont't think it's a good idea for parents to offer their school-age children money for each high grade they
4.0	get in school.
10.0	Here are my reasons:
4.0	First of all,as a student, to get a good mark is his duty.
9.0	So it is not nesscery to offer them money.
9.0	Too much money may
4.0	attract their attention to other things,such as goods,food and other things instead of studying.
10.0	This may make the
4.0	parents sad.
10.0	What's more,when the children get low grade,they may have no chance to get a reward,this may make
10.0	them sad.
10.0	Then, parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school may impress the children a
4.0	impression that all the things they should do in school is to get a high grade.
10.0	But  in our society ,we need students to get
4.0	more living skills instead of just studying.
10.0	To live a better life in the future,student shouldn't just study the knowledge from
10.0	books and class,they even need more practice to gain more society experience.
10.0	Having more money in school may lead a bad comparation between the studuent,it is harmful for the relationship
10.0	between the students and even the relationship between parents and children,it is not all the parents offer thier children
10.0	money as a reward.
10.0	Last but not least, parents to offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school may increase
10.0	the the expense of family.
10.0	In short,I dont't think it's a good idea for parents to offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in
4.0	school.
9.0	Instead parents may do other things with their children.
9.0	Going to a trip or a dilicious dinner may be a good choice.
2.0	Comparing with offering their school-age children money, these methods may make the children warm.
3.0	Nowadays, the question about would the studeents use printed books any more in twenty years from now has become a mamatter concern of many people.
3.0	Some peopel believe that students will not use printed books any more, while others believe students still use oprinted books in twenty years ago.
12.0	I vote for the idea that students will not use printed books any more.
4.0	To begin with, the schools and companys are use less printed paper then before, msot of then are compile their documents at computer or mobile phone.
9.0	For example of my sister, her school's teachers assign homework are the internet, also the teachers ask their students finish homework at soem application.
9.0	Such as the chinese teacher, his homework are use the application to read some books, also he can get every students plan at his mobile phone.
4.0	Moreover, the printed book are too heavy for the students.
9.0	I still rember, when I was young, at the primary school and midle school, i need to finished almost 5 to 6 differents homework, which means I need to took 6 differents book to home.
9.0	If we put this book together is almost 5kg at least, so teh students in the future would not use printed books anymore.
4.0	Finally, we know the fact taht the printed books are mainly made form tress.
8.0	In view of the growing seriousness of the environments problems and green space are decreasing step bu step.
8.0	The printed books will be limited in the future.
8.0	Also, printed books are more expensive compare with E-books which is cheaper and easily affordable.
2.0	I strongly believe that children will not use printed book any more in twenty yearts from now, because od the modern trend, tireded of students and environments problems.
3.0	Recently, an interesting question has aroused a heated debate among people: should the government improve the safety by hiring more police or improve the appearance by improving the old buildings and streets to attract toutists?
3.0	Some people hold the view that the authority does not need to do such things.
11.0	However, as far as I am concerned, it is necessary for the government to do like this to attract tourists.
5.0	First of all, safety is the prerequisite of a enjoyable travel.
8.0	This is to say, if people cannot keep safety when they go somewhere, they would not choose to visit there.
8.0	Therefore, if a resort want to attract tourists, they must keep their tourists safe at first.
8.0	So the authority should improve the safety by hiring more police.
8.0	On the contrary, when a tourista travel to a place equiped with unsufficient police, he cannot have a good time since he will be worried about his security: he dare not go out at night for fear that he would be robbed.
8.0	For instance, a news said that a girl travelling in Lijiang was beaten by the natives and she could not get help from the police at once because of the insufficient police.
8.0	And the event spreaded on the Internet quickly, people knew that we could not travel to Lijiang because maybe we would have the same experience.
8.0	Eventually, less people travelled to the city.
5.0	Besides, a good appearance of the old buildings and streets is a significant factor to attract tourists.
8.0	People travel to see the beartiful senary, take pictuers, experience the history of the cite.
8.0	In this case, a good appearance of old buildings and streets will leave them a deep impression, and plus, they will have a better experience of the trip because they do not need to walk on the harsh road.
8.0	By contrast, if the government do not improve the old buildings and streets, the tourists will think the conditions are dirty and they would not want to go there.
8.0	For example, there is a famous road in Wuhan, but its conditions are not well.
7.0	Last summer, my friend came to see me and we went to the road
3.0	Do you always think what kind of job is the way lead to the successful future?
3.0	Do you choose the right way that is suit for you and could lead you to a secure future?
12.0	I think the answer is very difficult because nowadays there are a lot of different kind of job or career could lead you to a brillian future.
11.0	But in before the ways lead us to be successful is very little and the competitive is not as firce as today.
5.0	Firstly, in before the successful future not only belone to these people who gain very high education and you just should have some different looking than others than you will be successful.
8.0	For example, the CEO of the Apple, who just study half of the university.
8.0	Suprisingly, he establish a very big company finally and he thinks that he can study the knowledge of the computer on books for himself rather than pay a lot of money to the university and listen to the professor.
8.0	But nowadays the level of the education become more and more important.
8.0	If we have high level of education, we will get the competitive edge when obtain some oppertunity.
8.0	And more and more prople are getting high education; a simple department will have thouthans of students.
8.0	Unfortunately, they all will compete with you in the future.
8.0	So should you just choose a very hot job or career but you will be stressful or choose a career which is less competitive.
8.0	It is a hard choice and we can not identify very exact.
8.0	Hense, choosing a suitble job is so difficult in nowdays.
5.0	Secondly, some career or job have grown very well and it is very difficult to bring a big improvment to this field.
2.0	Just like the business in China, during the before 30 years China open the market to the world; so a lot of chance occur in our country.
10.0	In this periord,
3.0	Which way of study can be more efficient?
3.0	which way the teacher assign the project can make more sense?
12.0	to work  together of learn individually on a project is quite a diaputable question .
12.0	dispite the multitude hold the opinion that to work alone can be of good contribution to the elevation of the study efficiency ,l strongly suppose the statement that working in a group can be more valid .
12.0	the reasons l cast below will definetly cament my point of view .
5.0	to start with ,as we know, we can learn from each other by the process of sharing different ideas .
8.0	thus, we can process a comprehensive scale of knowledge .
8.0	to illustrate ,l take my cousin for example, who was assighed a project to research a specific kind of mircogranizes for a medical study .
8.0	initially,he determined to cover it all by his own ,but soon the realized that he was lack of some crucial skill to accomplish the research ,hence he participated in a group which was doing the homogenous researech .
8.0	quite luckily, he won the success eventually and got a huge reputation .
8.0	the pertinent case l mention below can safely support my idea .
8.0	furthmore, by working in a group ,individuals can all  make contribution of what his or her is proficient in .
8.0	thus ,the research can be finished  more invincible.
8.0	take my classmate,jim for example ,he had been engaged in a study group which everyone has a specific skill .
8.0	to elaborate ,jim is good at mathmatical ,so he undertook the rule of establishing the mathematical model .
8.0	eventually ,his team learned from each other and reach the professor's  target .
8.0	the case above surely make the students learn with the highest efficient.
5.0	although we have to admit that  study all by one's own can have a little lesture ,such as it can get rid of the underlying distraction causing by the group discussing .
9.0	whereas,it is not a good deal .
9.0	we can eliminent the protential possibity of distraction by establishing a rule toghther.
0.0	as a pholospher once states ,the individual can't make a huge acheivement without a team's power .
0.0	we must alway believe in the potent of union .
0.0	we can imagine a brilliant future if everyone in the world has a perchant to study in a group rather than alone.
3.0	Recently,the problem concerning of education has aroused a wode discussion In my opinion,offerring school-age children money for high grade mark is a good idea.
3.0	First of all,it can motivate children to sdudy harder to get more money.
3.0	As is known to all,study is sometimes boring,and difficult to continiue.
3.0	Children are easy to lose motivation,and become hate to study.
11.0	However,if parents could offer some money for their high grade, i believe they will be interested in study,and study harder to get the reward.
6.0	Secondly,by offerring children money,parents can teach children how to manage their own money.
9.0	Parents could encourage their children to open an account in the bank,and teach children how to save money.
9.0	This will not only benefit their current lives,but also will influent their whole life.
2.0	Last but not least,oferring money to children can make them know that as you sow,so shall you reap.
11.0	I don't agreee with this opinion.
11.0	There may be a group of people who have gifts for being  leaders in their working careers,however ,it doesn't mean that all leaders come from talented people.
11.0	Individuals who adhere to thier targets and make great efforts can also become successful leaders.
4.0	You may meet a kind of people who with great talent of being a leader.
8.0	it's quite normal to have this kind of desire.
8.0	in modern society,whether people can be good leaders are becoming more and more important.
8.0	Qiuite a few people argue that people's ability of leadership comes without any practice,but others think that this can be grasped by everyone.
4.0	First of all,any ability including the leadership can be learned by perseverabt person.
8.0	Everyone is equal,maybe some people had the oppotunities earlier than others,it does not mean other people who work hard cannot achieve this forever.
8.0	Just like the volleyball pleyer,Hui Ruoqi,who was born with a heart disease,finally became the team leader of the Chinese Women's Volleyball .
8.0	What's more ,she conducted the whole team to gained the Championship of Olympic games in 2016.
8.0	despite her physical weakness,she never gave it up even when her doctor told her that she was not suitable to continue this agressive and stressed activity.
8.0	All this has indicated that practical actions can help someone to become a great figure.
4.0	Moreover,regarding successful leaders in the history, many of the are just average individuals.
8.0	And the reason why some people cannot manage to become good leader is because they haven't found the right methods to achieve their goals.
8.0	Take myselef for an example.
8.0	once Iwas selected to be the monitor of my high school class, but I was not well prepared to the previous issues that needed to be solved,so I didn't do my work fluently and my classmates had many doubts on me that I cannot explain.
8.0	If I wre given one more chance,I think I could get ready to shoulder this responsibility because I am well eqquiped now.
1.0	We can come to the conclusion that everyone could learn the leadership instead of born for leaders.
1.0	Not only by preseverant struggle but also taking successful leading methods into consiferation,people can learn to be leaders.
3.0	I disagree with the statement.
11.0	In my opinion, doing physical exercise is a much better way to relax than watching a movie or reading a book.
4.0	As far as I am concerned, physical exercise outweighs the other method to relax in two aspects.
4.0	First and foremost, it releases the physical tension and reduces stress in our bodies.
8.0	This is a result that can not be drawn from reading or watching a movie.
8.0	Instead, reading or watching movies in slumber positions may cause further tension physically.
8.0	Doing exercises may sounds a tiring process, but the after-effect of this tough process advocates for the best experience of total relaxation of the body.
8.0	Because of the exercises, falling asleep would be easy and quick, so that the stress will be reduced more properly.
4.0	As the frequently mentioned statement goes, doing exercise brings one a healthy body and a clear mind.
8.0	Hence the second aspect is that doing physical exercise relax the mind and make the psycological pressure level decline.
8.0	The reason for this is that when doing exercise, the muscle memory instead of the mindful memory is activated.
8.0	Therefore the brain could take a break during the whole process and let the body do all the work.
8.0	Many people have experienced moments that their mind went blank and peaceful during physical exercises.
8.0	Looking from another angle, exercising may also cause the mind to soar through the territory of daydreams, which often leads to a relaxed but creative state of the mind.
8.0	However, at the same time, reading or watching movies when one is in need to relax could only burden the mind further with new information.
10.0	In a word, physical exercise helps
3.0	Exercise and watching movie or reading a book are some way to relax.
3.0	The difference of these methods is staying inside of the door or staying outside of the door.
12.0	For me, I like to stay outside to workout, so  I disagree it is better to relax by wathchinga movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.
5.0	Reading books or watching movies help us to relax our bodies.
9.0	when i feel tired on my body, Reading an interesting book or Watchching movie are really helpful, I won't feel boring for staying inside of the door, and  doing these things could give me time to rest mentally and physically, but it is not really necessary for me, because I would like to sleep rather than watching movie or reading books for resting, it help me  relax quick and better.
9.0	Reading and Watching movie could be my hobbies, but they won't be my first choice or better choice for relax.
5.0	Exercise in some way can't help me to relasx physically, but it is really good at relax your mind.
8.0	When you are reading books or watching movie, you are still getting information from outside, a funny book or movie may make you laugh but your brain are still working, but I am a student, my brain is working all school days, the only thing I  need to rest is my brain.
8.0	For exercise, it can help stay away from learing more and more information and  empty my mind.
8.0	In another hand, after school, I really need to wake up my body, because my body won't get enough workout and it is bad for my body health if I didn't workout enough.
0.0	In conclusion I perfer exercise rather than reading books or watching movies.
0.0	Although stay indoor won't speed that mach energy.
0.0	I think it is better  to have some workout for my body and resting my brain from hard working in school.
3.0	Nowadays,many parent wants their kids to perform well both in academy and live.
11.0	As a consequence,more and more parents will give their school-age children money for high score they get.
6.0	From my prospective,this sort of parents give their kids too much expectation and giving reward for students' high grade is a two-side sword.
8.0	As we all know,beside paying housework fee to kids who help and meeting living needs,parents always give money to children who usually don't behave well to motivate them to study hard.
8.0	On one hand,this factor surely leads to enhance children's academic performance,to some extent.
8.0	On the other hand,some children will apply money to video games or getting friends together to have a party or some other entertaining events.
8.0	Other students may get some burden mentally and feel at a loss in a short period.
8.0	This is because they obtain what they usually don't attain easily and they feels like they are daydreaming.
8.0	Almost no students can insist in previous timetable and complete their assignment witn perseverance.
10.0	In a nutshell, it has both advtanges and disadvantages
3.0	There is no doubt that parents' accompany plays a vital role in children's education.
12.0	As some parents do not have lots of time to spend with their children, how that valuable time should be used is now controversial.
12.0	Some of people think it is best to spend that time playing games or sports with children while others belive that the best use of it is to do things together about schoolwork.
11.0	In my opinion, I agree with the former attitude for several reasons.
4.0	First of all, using the time to play physical games with children is beneficial for their body.
8.0	As we know, sports can indeed help children build strong body and with parents accompany it will be safer because parents can prevent them from hurting themselves.
8.0	As for me, when I was 6 years old, my father spent many time on his work and only had a little time a week to stay with me.
8.0	What he likes the most is to play badminton with me, which made me physical condition better than before.
8.0	Because of this, I was hardly sicked.
4.0	Second, exercising with children together is a practical method for parents to teach pass on some charaters to their children.
8.0	It is widly acknowleged that sports can teach children many things like the to persist.
8.0	For instance.
8.0	In my childhood, my father sometimes joint some activities like marathon.
8.0	During this activity, though it was hard to persist running the whole competition, he encouraged me to finish part of the length like 2km.
8.0	During the activity, I really felt hard to persist, but with his inspiration, I finally complete my appointment, by which I indeed leanrt the importance of persisting.
8.0	In my future life, I met sevral problems and everytime this experience would occur in my mind, which give me spirit to keep on fighting.
4.0	On the other hand, in my opinion, doing things related to schoolwork may be not a good choice as it is necessary for parents to encourage children to something by themselves.
8.0	Schoolwork was provided to let the childre review what they have learnt in the school or train them to solve some particular problems independently.
8.0	With parents' help, the schoolwork will be meaningless.
8.0	Thus, there is no need for parents to accompany with their children.
2.0	All in all, For all these reasons, I believe that exercising or playing games with children will be the best way for parents to spend their valuable time.
3.0	As the development of the society, there are much more various kinds of jobs.
3.0	Now whether it is better for children to choose the job that is similar to their parents or not is debetable.
11.0	Some people think that children can gain more benefits when they choose jobs that are very different from their parents because they can get more skills in this way.
10.0	As for me, I strongly believe that it is better for children to select career that are similar to their parents for following reasons:
5.0	First of all, taking work that are similar to their parents can avoid going atray.
8.0	Their parents must have many experience in this certain work , so they now waht exactly the downsides and the upsides of this work.
8.0	In this way, they can effectively lead the best path for their children and prevent bad things from happening.
8.0	For example, as a teacher, one has to speak a lot and is likely to have diseases that ha something to do with throat.
8.0	If your parent is a teacher, and you take teacher as your profession, because your parent is experienced and know this can happen in all likelihood, they can do some preprotection.
8.0	However, if your parents are not teachers and you are a teacher you cannot know what everything happens until you finally get a disease of throat.
8.0	But at that time, it is too late!
8.0	As a result, it shows the benefits of choosing jobs that are similar to their parents' job.
5.0	Secondly, choosing work that are similar to their parents is a very good way to improve one's ability.
8.0	Since they take similarprofessions, their work must have something in common and they can have a discussion of it then improve their own abilities.
8.0	Foe example, my mom is a HR and I am taking a job ot HR as well.
8.0	Then, we can discuss some good ways of electing people and topics such as ways of noticing people's shining point, making people do their best.
8.0	Then is a win-win situation because we can both learn something through this talk.
8.0	My mom's words might inspire me and my questions can push my mom thinking and manage to become a better staff.
10.0	"All in all, it's better for children to choose jobs that are similar to their parents because the ""shortcut"" they can have and the promote between their parents and themselves."
2.0	Then, what's the good of choosing jobs that are very different their parents'jobs.
3.0	It is not exaggeration that most people are not satisfied with their works,especilily when they are required to do the same things all days.
3.0	Workers are more likely to feel enjoyed when they have many different types of tasks to do during the workday.
3.0	Even some  part-time workers feel better than full-time workers,The reasons could be expressed as follows: To begin with,it is so boring to do similar things fo a long time,beacuse you are so familiar with it.
3.0	Assumping that you are a senior student in high school,your math teacher assign a hard math question you never seen before to you,the first time you will find how chllangable ,hard and interesting the question is,and you feel a sense of achievement when you give a perfect answer with a long time work.
3.0	But if you are required to repeat it every day,i firmly believe that you will get exhausted.
3.0	It is just like a punishment of writing words so many times.
12.0	working with similar works just like this.
6.0	Secondly,the more choice we have, the better quantity the work we can do.
8.0	And it will maks people feel happier.
8.0	Obviously,long time work for same things will frustrate works.
8.0	When people think it is not necessary to pay any attention to the work,they are easily distracked.
8.0	Thus,they feel plain.
8.0	But if they have choice which means more chllanges,they will make a sense of achievement and be more curosios about them.
2.0	Admittedly,pratice makes perfect,but if you pratice too much,it isn't a enjoyable process.
11.0	In my opinion,it is not a good idea to give money to children as rewards for getting high grades.
4.0	Fist of all, high grades are not the only important thing that students and parents should pay attention to.
8.0	There are some other qualities like sociality and creativity that may play more significant role in people's lives.
8.0	The action of giving money when children get high grades may lead them to regard the grades as the most important thing.
8.0	And this may have bad influences on children's further development.
4.0	Moreover, students are not studing for their parents but for their own future potential.
8.0	When they are given money after getting high scores, they may miss that point.
8.0	They will probablly think they are fighting for other people except themselves.
8.0	This may give much more pressure to them.
8.0	And this kind of presuure in some cases may even prevent students from active hard work.
8.0	Students may lose the most encouraging goal-their brighter futue.
8.0	And they may don't want to spend much time in study.
4.0	Lastly, some students want to do something harmful like drinking alchol or having cigerattes due to curiosity.
10.0	In that case, once they get too much money and the lack of parents' control, they are likely to get on a mislead to bad behaviors.
1.0	All in all, I think parents should not offer their children money as their high grades rewards.
1.0	They should let students know what matters and who they are studying for.
3.0	In my perspective, it's a good idea that parents offer their children money for high grade they get in scool.
3.0	Actually, this money act as a praise to their academic performance in the past.
12.0	It will motivate their children to study hard and stick to their dream.
12.0	When their children get the money, they must be excited and will have a stronger will to be more diligent.
9.0	Owning to this, parents must be willing to pay for this.
9.0	It benefits both the parents and their children.
6.0	However, every coin has its two sides.
8.0	What I want to point out is that the origin purpose to study is not for money.
8.0	Study is to get more knowledge that can change the way we think, we act and we live.
8.0	It could also cultivate our taste.
8.0	Actually, it is not supposed to do anything with money.
8.0	So, parents should point this out to their chidren, or the money will finally act as a misleading.
8.0	The amount of the money should also be proper.
8.0	Suppose that a students cheating in an exam just to get the money, what would their parents thing of it?
8.0	What negative effect will have on his future life?
0.0	Apparently, every parents expect their children to be excellent.
0.0	But the way of how to educate their children will always remain to be a question.
0.0	Different people will have different opinions.
0.0	Anyway, it's to make our education better and more efficient and make everyone live a happy life in the end.
3.0	With the development of technology and society , more and more technological inventions are changing our daily life.
3.0	For example, the bike that we share for each other have been devised to change our life.
3.0	Those inventions have a great influence on our life , including advantages and disadvantages,especially bike sharing .
12.0	I will talk about this invention.
4.0	First, i think the bike sharing have any great effect on our life.
8.0	As we all know, the students who are in the colleges that are much bigger than other cities'  colleges need to walk a long time to go to the class room.
8.0	So, they all need something to reduce the time that spend on the road .
8.0	The best way is to ride a bike in the campus.
8.0	The bike sharing has solved this problem , they can use the Mobike to go to the classroon  in  a low cost instead of buy a bike .
8.0	This invention also help people who need to walk so long to company.
4.0	Second, there are some disadvantages in this thing.
8.0	Because of many bike stay along  the street , it will rise the traffic jam on the mian road in Wuhan.
8.0	What's worse , there are many crash ocurred in the campus because there are too many students use the bike in the same time.
8.0	Additionly, we may cost much time to find a bike when we need it instaed of move right now .
8.0	It would not ensure us to arrival on time.
8.0	For example , i am usually late for class, because i always cost so much time to find a bike, but finally i did not find a bike to use .
8.0	But i can arrive on time when i walk to classroom the the beginning.
4.0	Admittedly, this invention actually have a bad influence on our society, but i think it's postive aspect will more importance for our life.
9.0	It will let us make more contribution to our environment  by this environmental friendly ways to trave.
9.0	Beside, I think it can save our money that we may need to spend on traffic.
1.0	Last , the technology will change our life , but the most important thing is the way how we use this technology.
1.0	If we can oder our action when we use the bike, I think  we can benefit from this more than before.
11.0	As many people believe that it is not a wise decision to give abundant money to children as a reward of their good grades,I'm also strongly against doing so.
11.0	I think it has many bad effects on those children who are too young to manage their money.
6.0	Firstly,yoo much extra money given by parents may spoil the children.
8.0	The children are too young to recognize things correctly, and unfortunately money is just one of them.
8.0	They won't cherish money because it is too easy to get it--they just need to perform well in an exam.
8.0	In result, they will not understand how hard it is for yheir parents to earn money.
8.0	Secondly, it can corrupt their hearts and goals.
8.0	Imagine how awful it would be if kids study hard just to get awarding money but not for accumulate knowledge.
8.0	Also, it would be horrible to parents if their children cheat in exams in order to get an A in exchange for money.
8.0	In addition,if children use the extra money to buy improper things, like games and expensive clothes, they will become disattracted and go away from their correct life.
8.0	If they use the money to buy drugs or alchoholic drinks, things just get worse.
8.0	"One of my old classmates enjoyed the ""policy"" and got extra money as reward, he used it to buy games and soon slided into the abyss of addiction."
1.0	In all, when it comes to extra money for children for good grades, my answer will be undoubtedly ''NO''.
1.0	I hope all the parents are wise enough to avoid the problems which could be caused by extra money for children.
3.0	With the development of science and technology, our lives change quickly and they are far from what they used to be.
3.0	For children, such changes is apparent and it is hard to avoid.
3.0	Children may touch PC or mobile phone when they are very young.
3.0	Also, plenty of various games attract them from reality.
3.0	Someone even claim that technology will made children less  creative than they were in the past.
3.0	I totally disagree with this idea.
12.0	As far as I am concerned, there are various application can be used to spur their crative thinking owing to the development of technology.
10.0	Futhermore, technology made gaining knowledge easier which is the base of creative thinking.
5.0	To begin with, there are more efficient ways can be used to galvanize childrens' creativity because of the deep study in human brain and its application via technology.
8.0	By learning more about human brain, it turn gradually clear that brain can be exercied more intelligent.
8.0	According to the study recently, the creativity even can be enhanced by some simple games, which are made up of some tricks or puzzles.
8.0	This is what we have never imagined before.
8.0	The development of technology made such fantasy to reality.
8.0	Without improved technology, we can only make use of orginal way to cultivate children's creativity, such as asking them to painting or designing, which turn out to be very inefficient and not suitable for every kid.
5.0	Moreover, technology make knowledge more accessible than before, which is exactly the fundation of creativity.
8.0	With the development of internet, we can gain information through our computers or mobile phone everytime and everywhere.
8.0	In the past, we can only convey knowledge one by one, generation by generation.
8.0	With the development of equipment, we can do relevent live experiment more convenient, while in the past, we can only imagine the real effect rather than observe the phenomenon by ourselves.
8.0	Observing the scientific phenomenon when they are young make boring knowledge more vivid and easy to obtain.
8.0	All of these knowledge build solid foundation for them to become more creative.
2.0	To sum, technology made children much more creative than they were in the past, by not only bringing more ways to help them motivate creativity, but also providing knowledge more convenient and vivid.
11.0	In my opinion, I agree with the idea that celebrities influence younger people more than older people.
11.0	Several reasons can be found to prove this claim.
4.0	First of all, younger people such as children or students are in their formative years which their values and the ability of  thinking independently are still developing.
8.0	In this period of time, people are susceptible to any incident or event ,including            the influence of celebrities.
8.0	For example, when a young child is watching at an advertisement on TV, it is likely that he will be attracted by the appearence and voice of a famous person in that advertisement instead of the product.
8.0	But for adults, they focus more on the quality and reality of the products introduced in that advertisement because they are mature enough to know that it is the product that is important in an advertisement, not the person who suggests it.
4.0	Moreover, for older people, their living habits are already developed and fixed, because they have been getting used to them for a long time and their living conditions are often consistent.
9.0	But for young people, it is the same reason, that they are still growing, that can make their habits and living conditions vary, which gives the space for celebrities' influence.
9.0	For an instance, an adult will not exercise because a famous athlete suggests him to do so, since his daily schedule is filled with what he already used to do, wherese a child always has a much more flexible arrangement for his time and habits, he can chose to do exercises at any time he is willing.
4.0	Finally, since the development of younger people needs a variety of models like their parents and teachers, celebrities become a new option for them to learn from.
9.0	At the same time, these celebrities can also see this as an oppurtunity to increase their fame, and attend the TV shows or cartoons which young people like to veiw.
9.0	To sum up, this can be seen as a motivation that celebrities want to attract young people, and  the reason why young people become the targets of famous people.
2.0	In conclusion, the lack of independent thinking, the relatively free living conditions and arrangements, and as a way celebrities can improve their fame, are the reasons why young people receive more influence from celebrities than older people.
3.0	There is no decaying that rewarding is a good way to motivate the students to study harder  , the  money is the most common way to reward the children when they get a high grade on these days .
11.0	Some people express that this is a good way to encourage them to work for.
11.0	However, in my opinion , this is not a suitable way for children .
5.0	Admittiely , some young  children may study harder in order to get the money as a rewarding.
8.0	It can actually give them a kind of encouragement and a self-achievement when they got a high grade , they may keep working harder for that.
8.0	However , this way may also cause a negative effect to children if they do not use the rules correctly.
8.0	For example , the children may lie to teachers and themselves during the process of  exams.
8.0	Thus they may get a good grade and also they can get money .
8.0	By the way , they can get a sweet feeling , they keep doing that again and again because they do not have the ability to testify which is wrong.
8.0	It may cause a really bad influence on their vision.
8.0	Hence , this is not a good way to motivate children.
5.0	Firstly,some children may work harder but they still cannot get a good grades.
8.0	These children may be upset because they grow rather than last time ,but they still cannot reach the standard that the parents set.
8.0	Nevertheless , other students get good points and rewards by lying others.
8.0	These children may feel unfair.
8.0	It may push them to walk in the convencent way.
8.0	It really give a bad image and influence on their mind.
8.0	They may do that again and again during the life.
8.0	Also their parents may give them a defination secretly which is that you should get a good result and you can enjoy the reward.
8.0	The children may do some thing against the law in order to get a good result in the future.
8.0	It really influence their mind in the futher Secondly ,the parents may teach the chilren the money is the most important thing , because the parents teach them the useful of money.
8.0	The children may misunderstanding the use of money and they may  do some thing badly in the futher.
10.0	All in all ,this is not a good idea
3.0	With the development of the society, both government and the citizens start to pay more attention about the entertainment and the cultures besides normal work and study.
11.0	Some people holds the opinion that in order to thrive the country, governments should give more financial support to arts in order to develop the culture and enrich people's life.
12.0	However, another group of people argues that at least they should be equally supported.
11.0	As for me, I am in favor of the later opinion for the following reasons.
5.0	To begin with, people's interests and entertainments are never less about sports than about art.
8.0	One reason that the government has to spend money on art  is that those things take up a large percentage of people's leisure time,  help to enrich their life and give them a mental treasure.
8.0	However, the sports can play the same part as art does.
8.0	Firstly, resemble to the mental health which arts devote to, the physics health is also very important and indispensable in our daily life, and sports do help people to mantain a fit body.
8.0	In addition, watching sports game is becoming a very popular way of entertainment among people from all social classers and all ages.
8.0	I can definitely say that if the government put more money into athletics, then people can receive the signal of the significance of the sports, so they will spend more time playing sports and get healthy body, which is the prerequisite of the thriving and prosper of the city.
5.0	In addition, it's more necessary and urgent for the athletics to get support from the government.
8.0	In order to get good grades in the sport games such as Olympic teams, atheltes have to spend a large amount of money in hiring the topnotch coaches, buying expensive food with nutrients, supporting the whole families with salaries.
8.0	However, the individuals and companys can hardly afford those money.
8.0	Also the atheletes receive little from the scholarship in wining an olympic games, so nearly nobody is willing to spend money on those athletics without high return.
8.0	So the government should take it's duty to afford the expense.
8.0	In the other hand, artists do not need that much money, their tools like canvas cost little.
8.0	Furthermore, some artists get their inspiration from the suffering and harsh environment, so there is no such need for the government to support them.
1.0	It's clear that the government should at least spend equal money on the athletics and art.
1.0	Even it's no problems that it support athletics more than art, for athletics really plays an essencial part in people's daily life and athletes are in urgent need of the money to get good grades.
7.0	With such policy to grant sports, the city can surely
3.0	Choosing jobs are always an issue for young people.
3.0	It is a discussion about whether to choose the jobs as their parents.
11.0	Choosing the same job can be somehow boring and tedious, but I strongly believe that children can benefit more from that.
12.0	Because children can receive the working experience directly about their job, and they can even know more about their parents as the viewpoint of colleage.
5.0	Firstly, choosing the similar jobs of parents helps the child with career.
8.0	To be specific, parents can easily give proper advices and tell experience of the job, the child's growth will be much faster.
8.0	For example, my father is a  doctor major in the heart disease for many years, my sister works as a nurse after graduate, my father always tells some cases about heart disease.
8.0	One day, my sister was taking care of a patient who suffered heart disease.
8.0	That night, the patient's condition became very dangerous, but the doctor were at home and could not arrive the hospital immediately.
8.0	Only my sister could help the patient at that time, my sister recalled one case in the same situation told by our father, she did the appropriate dispotion, then the patient became out of danger.
5.0	Moreover, choosing the same job allows child to learn more about their parents.
9.0	In other words, child can know the course of life in details by share the job's working experience.
9.0	To illustratek, my mother is a lawer, she took part in a case to be on the side of the criminal, I did not understand her when I was young.
7.0	After I graduated from college, I became a l
3.0	As the competition among students becomes fierce, it's more important for students to get good grades.
3.0	So a hot discussion regarding whether it is a good idea for parents to offer money for their child's high mark has arouse the interests among the general public.
11.0	In my opinion, i think it's  a good method for parents to do and there are three reasons to support my view.
5.0	At first, offering children money for each high grade saves a lot of time.
8.0	Because, parents always be busy and don't have time to teach children for their studies.
8.0	It is a time-saving idea for parents to take part in the process of kids' study and have sense of the results of their kids' studies.
8.0	So parents can have more time to work, prepare the food in each meal, even relax for their health.
5.0	Sencondly, students can be encouraged by money to study harder and get good grades.
8.0	Because if students get money to buy what they want and know the benefit brought by money, they will try harder to get good grades to get the money.
8.0	For instance, when i was a student in high school, my parents will give me the money as a reward for the high mark.
8.0	I always studied very hard even if others went to play, because i know that i study for myself and i have the aim to encourage me to study better.
8.0	As a result, i always got scholarship every year in my high school and go to a good college.
8.0	So i think this method is a efficient way to encourage students to study.
0.0	Lastly, this idea conforms to the social life.
0.0	Because when they grow up to work, they will get year-end bonus or other reward if they work hard.
0.0	They will also work efficiently to get better reward as their student life if they see the reward as their aim rather than working without aim.
0.0	And students can also adapte the social life in advance, it will help them in their future life.
3.0	Nowadays, many people watch a movie read a book or do physical exercise during the relax.
12.0	As for me, I would like to choose doing physical exercise.
12.0	First of all, doing physical exercise is benefical to your body.
8.0	As the technology developing, most people could finish their job on the computer.
8.0	But everthing coins have two parts, they have to sit on the chair for a long time.
8.0	What is the worse, it will have a bad influence on your eyes.
8.0	If you go to watch a movie or read a book, it could be worser.
8.0	However, doing physical exercise could make your body stronger.
6.0	Second, doing physical exercise could improve your diet.
8.0	After sports games, you will feel hungry.
8.0	Although you eat more, you could lose weight at the same time.
8.0	Last but not the least, doing physical exercise could help you keep good habits.
8.0	If you are addicted in smoking or drinking, not matter how rich you are, doctors could not save you when you are ill seriously.
8.0	Sports could not only help you making more friends, but also become happy.
12.0	Nowadays, according to the development of transportation, many peopke will travle on vacation.
11.0	Most of people think that they will get more benefit from traveling in their own country than frome traveling to fireign countries.
11.0	I think traveling in one's own contry can get many benefits, but not necessarily more than traveling abroad.
5.0	First, traveling abroad can practice your oral foreign language skills.
8.0	That is because people will lear one ore several foregin language in their own country, but they are surrounded by people who speak the same language as us.
8.0	It is hard to get a chnce to practice the foreign language, If people travel abroud, they can fully pravtice their oral foreign language.
8.0	For example, my sister traveled to America last summer vacation.
8.0	Before she went abroud, she though her spoken English was good enough, but only after she went aroad she realized how bad her accent was.
8.0	After half a mounth of life in the United Stated, by communicating with others, she learned to limitate the pronounciation and intonatinon of local people to weaken her accent.
5.0	Second,traveling abroad can exercise one's independence.
8.0	No matter wher you go in the local country, you will meet people who speak same language as you.
8.0	But when people travel abroad, they will meet people from different countries.
8.0	Psychologically, they will get uneasy feeling.
8.0	For instance, there are some  people can speake English in Thailand.
8.0	When I first wnet to Thailand, I lost my way.
8.0	If I get lost in my country, it is easy to ask a local person for direction.
8.0	But at that time, I was afraid thet I could not undersatand what they said and I might even be laughed at,but finally got up the courage to ask.
2.0	Finaly, different counry have different culture and history.
12.0	Although giving money can push children to study hard in a sense,but I think it's unhealthy for school-aged children in fact.
12.0	So I don't think it's a good idea.
8.0	indeed,children can probably make a progress by giving them money when they get a high grade,but in fact,they are not study for themselves but for the money.
8.0	They don't know what they really need to get,and further more,they do not have the concept that they need to study for their own ambitions,not their parents.
8.0	Bill Gates has never give his kids money derrectly,and what he did is that he allowed his children to work for money.
8.0	only in this way,can they really know what they wants and why they work for money.
6.0	What's more,giving money for good grades won't make children indenpendent.
8.0	In this way,children need other's help to engage thenselves into study.
8.0	they may not make a decision and stick to for it.
8.0	When I was ypung,I was also admire other classmates' prizes from their parents for their good grades.
8.0	but as I was growing up,I realized that this speice of independence benefits me a lot.
8.0	So I think giving maney for grades is not beneficial to indepe
3.0	Do you often think something for a long time?
3.0	And do you feel you do not need think for too long time that you could have a resolution from the website?
12.0	The thchnology develope very quickly and it help our life a lot.
12.0	We can play game or solve some life  and study problem more efficient.
12.0	But I think all of these cannot cultivate the creative of us.
11.0	So for this opinion I do not agree.
6.0	When children paly some game during their free time, in before most children will paly with other children and play some intelligent game but now most of them will play the phone.
8.0	In the past, we cannot have plantiful games from the computer or the phone.
8.0	As a result of that, we must find some friends and creat some interesting games.
8.0	To build a small building that is made of dust is very usual in my childrenhood.
8.0	It not only could let us learn how to do a thing well with others but also can cultivate the creative ability of us.
8.0	During this prosess, we will think how to design this building and how could make it look beauty than others.
8.0	All of this will give the children brain a kind of stimulate and in the future it will help them a lot.
8.0	But if they just paly computer game like nowdays, they just have a happy time and smile.
8.0	Thus, they cannot study knowledge and cultivate ability from these game.
0.0	Second, when children meet some things that they cannot understand, most of children will find the answer from the wedsite in the current days.
0.0	It can not let them think by themselves and lost criticize thinking.
0.0	In before when a child sees a bird fly on the sky, he will think that why the bird can fly but the human can not.
10.0	So he will think for several days and during long time think he will ask their teacher or read some book.
7.0	So they have a process tha
12.0	I don't think parents offer their kids money for high mark schools is a good idea.
12.0	First of all,study is all about the kids themselves.
8.0	Students' hard work is for the purpose of getting higher education and getting a chance to achieve their their dreams.
8.0	It's important for children to know that they are studying for themselves,for their future.
8.0	But if parents rewarded their kid with money when they get good grades,the kids will naturally have the idea that they study only for their parents and extra money.
5.0	In addition,good grades doesnt meaning everything.
8.0	Parents' offer of money will make the kids consider that grades is more important than everything.
8.0	But the truth is that there are lots of things which are way more important then grades,for instance,hobbies,imagination and independence.
8.0	These are also inreplaceablearts of a child's growth that both parents and kids can not ignore.
8.0	Thus,in the face of a kid's healthy growth,grades seem less important.
5.0	Finally,it is necessary for kids to know that they can only earn money by their hard work at jobs or intellegence.
8.0	Parents should let their kids realize this at a very early age.
8.0	This idea helps avoid a kid to commit crimes like robbing a bank or steal a wallet,because it's locked in their system that they should earn money with efforts and hard work.
8.0	But reawrding good grades with money won't help them understand this idea.
1.0	In conclusion,it is defenitely not a good idea for parents to offer kids money for higher marks.
1.0	For kids' growth and future,parents should never put such idea inti action.
12.0	No,I think reading a book is less relex than doing physical exercise.
12.0	First,it is acknowledge that people now take more and more working schedules.
12.0	Nonetheless,a meticulous look help us to find the fact that physical exercise is an unsurpassed choice for alleviation owning to the outlet ways and sound body it provided.
6.0	Second,physical exercises can make our chest and heart more and more porrowfull.
8.0	That's none of books or movies can do.
8.0	just as a coin has two side,everything has advantage and dis advantage,book can make people more wise,it also make man neglected how importent the exercise is.
8.0	So,what should people do to make their life safe and pleasant?
8.0	Physical exercise,in dddition,exercise neber lack paramount benefits to our well-being.
8.0	Besids affluent wealth of knowledge from books or movies,
3.0	The statement of letting the kids make mistakes and learn from it in the same time is reasonable.
11.0	Firstly, making mistakes can let the kids have more accumulation of life experience.
8.0	For instance, when I fall over some obsatcles, my mother wouldn't lift me up, she just watch me standing up by myself.
8.0	If I'm crying, my mother would tell me to be brave, and be more careful next time.
8.0	I could hardly understand her meaning at firat but then i get to know it.
8.0	Now, I seldom fall over, and I remember my mother's words all the time, avoiding falling down for the second time.
6.0	Secondly, making mistakes can let the children become a more successful person.
8.0	Maybe in the aspect of studying or other.
8.0	For example, I  often made mistakes in doing tests, which were caused by my carelessness most of the time.
8.0	I often forgot to write my name when I was in Grade 1 and Grade 2.
8.0	So it's normal for me to have no scores for some certain subjects.
8.0	Also I often make some basic problems in math.
8.0	I always make calculating mistakes, and it cost me a lost.
8.0	But it didn't appear since Grade 3, because I had learned from my previous mistakes.
8.0	Since then, I start to remember write my name and didn't make mistakes on calculating.
1.0	Thirdly, making mistakes can let the kid be more mentally mature.
1.0	The kids making more mistakes have better mental health than the kids who nerver make mistakes.
8.0	For example, it is know that the students with good grades are often worried by mental disease.
8.0	If they failed in some tasks and they are blamed by their parents, some extreme behaviors may happened to them.
8.0	But for the students who often make mistakes, they would have a light heart towards every mistakes they had make, and have an active mind to correct it, avoiding to happen the next time.
8.0	So it is dispensable for the parents to let their kids making mistakes and help them to learn from teh.
3.0	Nowadays,people are always tricked by strangers so they are less willing to help the struggling strangers.
11.0	This can be shown as social atmosphere,people's experience and others' opinions.
12.0	These are the elements when a person tries to help a stranger and fianlly refuses to help him.
4.0	First of all,today's society has a bad atmosphere that people don't want to get more trouble to help others.
9.0	For example,a man who has work to do but at this time,an old man needs him to help to cross the street,he pretens to not even look at the old man.
9.0	This shows that when people have things to deal with,they don't want more trouble things come to them.
4.0	Additionally,when people are trying to help others,they will first think about what them have experienced.
8.0	And this might cause them to change their mind.
8.0	For example,a news reports that a old man lays on a street and a young man help him to get up,then the old man asks him money for falling him down.
8.0	And since this news,most of people don't want to help others to get up which means the experiences will change a lot on whether help or not.
4.0	Last but not the least,the public opinions have influenced on helping people.
9.0	For instance,a classmates help a old woman to collect garbages everyday and get poor in studying,all her friends,teachers and parents blame her,so she stops the help.
9.0	This claims that the pressure from others' words change people mind from helping stangers.
2.0	In conclusion,people today are less willing to help struggling strangers based on social atmosphere,people's experience and others' opinions.
7.0	Definitly speaking .
8.0	I don't think it's a good idea for the following reasons .
8.0	firstly , this method will make children more negative .
8.0	because children are naive , they don't have definitly notion about money , maybe money is the things that can  replaced by nacks books or the things they like .
8.0	but in adult's world , money is the cretiror of glory and reputation , if children acquier money when they get high mark , they will aware of they real sense of money , maybe they would be hard-working not for their pure dream , but for money , that way , they will think high grade equal to the money , maybe they would be negative when they aren't get enough money .
8.0	second , i think this prize will help children to get bad hobby , because children are naive , they can't control themselves in some palces , especially when they meet what they like , and then they will  buy whatever they like , therefore , when they establish a concept that they can buy whatever they like by money , they will spend their money cotrollessly , maybe when they run out of their money they will ask money for theit parents , that makes it difficult for them to become modest .
12.0	Currently, a controversial topic has aroused heated debate among people: is it true that remaining happy and optimistic when you fail is more important than success.
11.0	Some claim that success is more important because it can bring us a great sense of achievement.
11.0	However, contrary to their view comes my perspective that keeping in good mood when confronted with failure is more important.
12.0	My point is well elaborated as follows.
5.0	To begin with, only when you deal with failure in optimistic can you do better in continue difficulties.
8.0	To be specific, with the good mood, it is easier for people to chear up and analyze the reason why they fail bravely in spite of how bad the result is.
8.0	In this way, chances are that they learn a lot form the failure and avoid the mistake in future.
8.0	However, if people only care about the result, they might find it easy to got lost once they fail.
8.0	Under this circumstance, they will be afriad to try and do worse in future because the fear of failure.
8.0	For example, my little sister is learning skiing now.
8.0	Everytime when she fails to ground, no matter how painful, she just laughes happily and try again.
8.0	Therefore, she is more and more adept to it.
5.0	In addition, remaining good mood when people fail is conducive to people's metal health.
8.0	As we all know, metal health is bound closely with people's condition.
8.0	Therefore, copying with difficulties in optimistic brings people better spirit world and releases their stress nerves, which help to keep a good metal heathy.
8.0	However, it is not doubt that If people always feel sadness and worry about wether they can success, they will suffer a lot from metal disease, such as insomnia.
7.0	For example, my uncle works for big four always concerns about the final performance, even during checking the voucher, he still thinks about the result and once he fails he will be sad and can;t cheer up
12.0	I agree with the statement that watching movie or reading book to relax is better than doing physical exercise, here are my 3 statments: First of all, reading or watching movies will not let us spend too much energy than sports, if you spend time to do exercise for relax you will feel much more tried than reading.
8.0	Secondly, reading or watching movie can make your mind calm, during this time you don't need to worry about other things only need to enjoy your peaceful time.
8.0	Differently, if you choose physical exercise your body will always keep excited and you always need to keep your mind concentrate, so exercise will only let you get tireder.
8.0	In my poinion, watching a movie or reading a book can be the better way to relax.
12.0	Recently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people whether should the people focus on achieving realistic goals rather than dreams.
11.0	Some people claim that people should focus on achieving realistic goals rather than dreams.
11.0	However I would stand on their opposite side and I believe that people should follow their heart to achieve their dream rather than focus on the real life.
10.0	And my reasons can be seen as follows:
5.0	First of all, I think following dream could encourage people and give them success.
8.0	As we all know, in the world, many famous are dreamer.
8.0	They usually have a big dream, and then they focus on their dream and study hard and work hard.
8.0	When they face something difficult, their dream will encourage them to overcome it rather than give up.
8.0	For example, when I was a high school student, I had a dream that become a scientist.
8.0	So I study hard to achieve it.
8.0	Although high school ilfe was so boring, I still enjoyed study, because my dream encourage me.
8.0	And my classmat usually gave up and then slept because they do not have a dream, because they just focued on the real life.
8.0	Finally I got the offer of a good university, and my classmate failed in the finally test.
5.0	What's more, the dream can give people a target leading them.
8.0	As we all know, if some one run in the circle track, they will stay at a same spot finally.
8.0	So we need a direction in our life leading us to go on ranther than run in the circle track.
8.0	For example, when I was young, I wanted to be a scientist, so I collected so much information with science.
8.0	And then I had an exact aim and track.
8.0	Then I followed this track.
8.0	Finally, I enter into a good university.
8.0	My friend donot have any dream and just focus on the real life.
8.0	So he is still puzzle with life, and he do not know what should he do.
10.0	In a nutshell, following dream could encourage people and give them success and  the dream can give people a target leading them.
2.0	So I think we should follow our dream ranther than just focuing on real life.
3.0	With social development, having a decent job is a dream for everyone.
3.0	To get quick promotion and get better salary, people always want to study hard in school to accumlate plenty of academic knowledge.
12.0	At the same time, they ignore talking with other people because they spend much time in studying.
11.0	However, as far as I am concerned, the ability to relate well to people is more important than studying hard in school for success in a future job.
4.0	Firstly, getting along well with your coworkers can get effeciency in work.
8.0	As we all know, we will face various problems in working in business, like hiring people or financial problems.
8.0	Whatever difficulties we face, if we relate well to people, we can find the keys to solve the problems quickiy, because everyone have different angle about the same question.
8.0	With these benefits, we can save tons of time and efforts.
8.0	With these time, we can do other business affairs to improve ourselves.
8.0	While having higher knowledge and not talking with people, you may have to spend much time on difficulties, which is negative for your job.
4.0	Secondly, if you communicate well with your fellows, you will become more responsible.
8.0	Having seminars in business is a good oppotunity for you to find your own fault.
8.0	During this section, people will tell you what you should do better, like watching tables much seriosly.
8.0	Therefore, you will correct your own weakness and get a sence of responsibilities to have a better impression in colleagues.
8.0	Futhermore, you may want to help someone out as much as you can in the company, which enable you to get quick promotion and improve yourself.
8.0	Studying hard in school can not teach you how to be responsible in a job.
4.0	Thirdly, you can expand your social network and build up friendly relationship while relating well to people.
8.0	There are plenty of people in the business who are into different fields.
8.0	During the period of time of communicating with each other, you can find someone who are like the same things, such as reading Harry Porter or playing volleyball.
8.0	Making friends in a company become more availiable if you want to chat with each other.
8.0	Meanwhile, you can share your own desperate feelings and problems with intimate colleagues, which is a good way of relieving.
8.0	Having higher knowledge and not talking with each other will make you depression when facing problems and you will not know how to proceed relationship with people.
2.0	In conclusion, it is good for you to have ability to relate well to people for success in a future job rathar than studing hard in school.
11.0	As people's life quality improved quckily, we have more energy and capacity to do something for others.
12.0	There is a question that should we spend our personal time to help the communities?
11.0	May some people think young person won't be so helpful.
11.0	However, I think for most young people, they would like to do this.
10.0	My opinion are stated as follows.
4.0	First,the young people have more capacity to do volunteering work.
10.0	The young person is more active and energetic,
4.0	What's more, the younger today have the sense of social responsibility.
10.0	From they are very young, their parents and teachers have told them to be helpful,
4.0	It's true that the young people are too busy, they spend a lot of time on work and study.
8.0	However, the company and school always organized the volunteering work.
8.0	For instance, the universities have a kind of scores that only can be got from social work, such as cleaning the streets or help with the traffic work, so many students take participate in the volunteering work for the communities.
8.0	It's the same in the company, they can get some reward from this, so young people are willing to help their communities.
1.0	So, for the three reasons that young people have more capacity, scoial responsibility and the school and company encourage them to volunteer.
1.0	I claim tha young people give enough time to help others.
3.0	Nowadays, many telebision occur in people vision.
3.0	And also some young children who need watch everyday.
3.0	It must lead some influence for children grow.
10.0	Some people argue that we should allowed them to watch TV ; some people think that we should not allowed them to watch TV.
12.0	But for my perspective, I think people shold allowed them to watch TV, even if it can directed toward young children.
5.0	First and formost,  young children watch TV can complete their own auditory sense, which can stimulate their speak ability, because soem children do not have a perfert auditory sense;  I mean is they cannot bulit a good auditory sense when they not grow up.
8.0	For example, my neighbor have a young boy, and I remember last once, when I go to their home to borrow some stuff, then I get a chance to talk to this little boy, I am surprise for that this boy can speak some word which belong adult.
8.0	So I  must ask his mother: why your children can speak these word, then she told me that his children always watch TV, and they do not know that is good or bad.
8.0	In these case, we can konw that watch TV have benefit for young children.
5.0	Second, watching TV can improve their knowledge, when these young children not go to the school.
8.0	They can watch TV and also that can improve their konwledge.
8.0	When they go to school to study; they can have some advantage than other children.
8.0	For instance, when I volunteer at a school, I cannot remember these children are mor knowledgeable than other children.
8.0	When I ask their teacher, who told me that they always organize the children to watch TV, because they know that it can help the children for study.
1.0	Admittedly, some people think that watch TV can make children short-sighted, which is absolutely true.
1.0	Watching TV when these children  in a young age.
10.0	O
3.0	First of all,I disagree with the follwing statement.
11.0	Phsical exercise is a better way to relax our body and mind.
12.0	When we finish our work,We uauslly feel tired.
8.0	So many people decide to watch a movie or read a book to relax themselves,but after these they  do not feel good .
8.0	Why？
8.0	Because our body is tired as same as our head.
5.0	So we should find ways to relax our body,too.
8.0	However,watching  the tv or reading a book can not relax our body.
8.0	IT do make us feel comfortable,but the body do not get enough relaxing activities.
8.0	So if you want to be relaxed,doing physical exercise is your better choice.
8.0	Doing physical exercise makes our flood run fast,so the oxythen can be thanserfered to the right place faster.
8.0	Envery cell can get enough oxythen and play its role better.
8.0	We will feel  excited and energetic because of these.
5.0	When we do phsical exercise,our head order all of our muscles to take part in the exercise.
8.0	So it does not  only exercise our head  ,but also exercise our body.
8.0	But reading a book can not do this .
8.0	As for the sports games,we can choose the basketball game or swim.
8.0	Besides this ,running and walking are our good chioces,too.
1.0	In a word,doing physical exercise is a better choice to relax ourselves.
1.0	I disagree with the follwing statement given in the question.
11.0	As far as i'm concerned, i don't think it is a good idea to offer the children with money every time they get high marks.
6.0	Here are some reasons, first of al, this strategy is indeed a very efficient way to help the children improve their grades in a short period, however, it will lead to the result that the children are not going to deal with the homeworks or exams seriously and patiently unless they are given the awards.
8.0	There actually exist an example, my best friend used to be very hardworking, and his aim was to reach the top of our class,the only reason was that his father promised to buy him a new telephone if he got the highest marks, but soon after he got the phone, he could't concentrate on study anymore, he even could't finished his homeworks on time,which led to his failure in the college entrance exam.
8.0	It really sounds unbelivable, but it did happened.
8.0	"Let's return to our main topic, the second reason is that the so called ""reward"" strategy can even give the children an erro sense of value, which will cause troubles in their futures."
8.0	Here comes an example, an officer called a new employee to tried his best to negotiate with another manager of a big company, the employee only talked about the money in the neogotiation, which resulted in the failure of the talk.
8.0	So we can conlude that if children grow up with this kind of teaching methonds, he will deal with everything in a conception of money.
8.0	So, in my opinons, this kind of teaching method is totally wrong, which will lead to unchangeable sense of wrong value in the whloe life of the children.
2.0	Based on what i've said, i think iis wise to find another way to teach children.
11.0	It's not proper to give money to the school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.
8.0	If every time the child is given money when the behave well,  the child may be mislead to this concept that attending school and geting high mark is a kind of trade, and the child regard this as a way to get money.
8.0	So the child will focus on the money he will get rather than the knowldge he has learn in the school.
8.0	This would be very harmfull.
8.0	The school is a place where the child gets educated, rather than a place where the child make their money by behave well.
8.0	Maybe, to some extend, the money will encourage the child to behave well and aim at geting high mark, this would be harmfull in the long wrong.
8.0	It's won't help to improve the chid's knowledge storing.
8.0	A better way for the parents to encourage the child to study well is telling the child the improtance of study well, and geting the child feel the benefit of the knowledge, and making the child be atrracted by the knowledge.
8.0	Then the child would behave well in the school and seek for high grade by themself, rather than by the stimulation of geting money form their parents.
6.0	Money simulation would be harmfull to the health of the child's mental health.
8.0	The money may make the child money-leaded.
8.0	They may aim at money whatever they do in their everyday life, and the regard the money as the only goal of their life, while ignore the importance of the phycological relationship.
8.0	As far as they become money-leaded, they will not treasure the friendship, won't treasure the lover-relationship.
8.0	Everything they do is for money, this is very terrible.
2.0	So I don't thik it's a good idea for the parents to offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.
12.0	I think this is not a good ideal,becouse the children well spend more money for play without study.
9.0	The parents should offer  the children the nessery money  for calss and buy some books ,or buy something to eat,so that the children will pay attion on thier study.
9.0	If the parents wish their children can learn knowledge and be sucess,they must be learn to how to teach thier children.
3.0	Is the history courses necessary for our learning?
3.0	Does the extra course influence our normal life?
11.0	As a common university student, from my perspective, the history courses are not significant for our learning if we major in other courses.
12.0	Since the history course slow down our learning efficiency and it is unuseful for our cource and credit .
6.0	On the one hand, the history course render our learning efficiency slowly.
8.0	To be more convincible, if we do not major in history, the histroy course will distract us from our major course.
8.0	For instance, we cost a large amount of time in history learning, we recite the point in the book, discuss some famous history evidences like the World War II.
8.0	It will wastes extremly long time for the learning in our major likes the time costs in mathematic calculation and chemistry experiment.
8.0	As a consequnce, we will have less time to do in our major, the history course will decrease our learning efficiency in our major course.
8.0	Meanwhile, the history course will give press to our after-school break time.
8.0	If we learn history after school, we will have less time to sleep or have a break.
8.0	Then we will feel sleeply and unaminate.
8.0	As a result, it decrease the learning efficiency in our major learning.
1.0	On the other hand, the history course is unuseful for our course and credit.
1.0	To be specific, do the extra history course can not earn more credit and learning history have not any effect on your course in final exam or month exam.
3.0	Nowadays, some parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.
11.0	I don't think it's a good phonomeon.
12.0	Here's my opion.
11.0	By doing this, it can only make students study for money instead of something which can improve them.
8.0	That is to say, it makes education utility.
8.0	I always insist in that we study to improve ourselves and to make our soul peaceful.
8.0	We study beacause we want to study, in the constrast, if we don't want to study but do it, it isn't study, it must be something else, maybe a task.
8.0	So to know whethe we study well, we have exams.
8.0	As for the exam, grades are the most important.
8.0	They can subjectively reflect wheather you study well, so, if you get good grades, it means you study well.
5.0	But when parents offer children money for good grades, they may not take grades as a reflection of their study, but a tool to earn more money.
8.0	By doing so, it can easily make study utility and scheular, in the other word, children don't study because they want to study, they study for money.
8.0	They will not study hard to improve themselves, to make their soul peaceful, but to get high grade to get money.
8.0	To achieve this, they try many methods to get high grades, after doing so, many of them even use some extreme ways, such as cheating.
8.0	It's a really serious situation.
5.0	So, after say this, I really hope parents stop offering money for high grades.
9.0	They can replace money to something else, such as books` a family trip and an encouragous saying.
9.0	By doing so, students can study more hard and have a useful goal to study.
2.0	Hoping all the students know why they study and do it well.
3.0	Nowadays, with the development of technology, people more and more concern about history.
12.0	People can get some informations about history from movies, novels, and news.
11.0	However, some people contend that all university students should be required to take history coures no matter what their field of study is, but I strong believe that not all of the university students have to take history courses because students who take more time to focus on the field which they are studying will be more successful.
12.0	In addition, not all of the student are suit of learning history.
5.0	First of all, student who takes more time to focus on one's field will be more successful.
9.0	Some students leaning history would not has any help on their field, so quit the history course can helps them focus on their fields, and they will have much more achievement on their fields.
9.0	For instance, my sister is major in machine, and she has a lot of courses to take everyday, and she quit all of the else courses like history courses to make sure that she have enough time to study machine, ang she is the best student in her field.
5.0	Secondly, some students are not suit of history will have low effecient to taking history courses.
9.0	Some university student only good at studying some thing like math and physic, and they are bad at learning history, so that for them, it may takes a long time and only have a little achievement.
9.0	To illustrate, I am good at math, but I am really bad at history, once I attempt to study history with a lot of times, I try to study history every night, but I only have a little progressive.
2.0	It is fact that taking history courses has a large amout of advantages because we can learn a lot of country's history.
7.0	Nonetheless, focusing on one's field will moresu
3.0	As the improvement of society, more and more cities produce places for tourists to visit.
3.0	In order to appeal more tourists, some cities improve old buildings and street to achieve a good appearance,others hire many police to ensure the toutists safety.
3.0	So the topic of which method is more effective arouses a debate.
3.0	I hold the view that develop safety by recruit more police is better.
11.0	The reasons can be illustrated as follows.
6.0	First, safety is the most important factor which touring people concern.
8.0	Only a place where is safe people are willing to travel.
8.0	When people see there are many police to matain the process in the public, they will get the sense of satefy and recomand their friend to travel there.
8.0	If there is less police, people who first there to travel will feel nervous and fear to be robbed by native people.
8.0	For example, I have ever been to the Tibaten in China, there were many police along the road to Lasa City.
8.0	My friends and me  all felt safety and willing to stay Lasa city for long time.
1.0	Second, it is true that improve old buildings can develop the appearance of the city, but  the raw buildings can show the real city history which the tourists are interested in.
1.0	So government should not improve the old buildings but hire more police to protect the old building from being destoryed so that the tourist will go to the city to enjoy original scene.
10.0	For exmaple, their is an old stone sculputure in Sichuan, the government improve it by covering colorful dye.
7.0	The historian criticize the goverment do not know about how to protect the c
3.0	It is unnecessery to offer school-aged children money for each high mark they get in school .
5.0	The follows are my humble reasons.
5.0	First and foremost,studying in the school,the aim is to gain knowdge,not  the money or something else.
8.0	then,this behavier may accelerate the school-aged children's some bad acknowledgement.
8.0	For example,they may think that the aim of studying is money or awards.
8.0	This may cultivate their material spirite.
8.0	In fact,The aim of studying in school is to make some progress in ourself.
8.0	Such  as ,enlarg our eyesight and knowledge.
8.0	Last but not least,this thoughts effect our education .
8.0	learning is a pure motivation in improving ourselves.
8.0	If the school-aged children get a nice performence,we will provide some price for them.
8.0	Such  as ,ceitification,scholorship or books.
11.0	When it comes to the issue about how to relax oneself when you feel tired,people's opinion differs from person to person.
12.0	Some people prefer doing exercise when they are buried in working chores for a long time,while others may choose to watch a movie or have a quick flip through a book when they feel exhausted.
11.0	As far as I am concerned,both of the two methods are to be emphasized.
11.0	In my opinion,doing physical exercise is no less important than watching a movie or reading a book.
5.0	Primarily,working out after a long period of struggling can make people refreshed,and then people could come back to their work or study with a fresher thought and a clearer mind,which could definitly improve their working or learning efficiency.
8.0	Take me as an example,I have had a hard time struggling for my En Furthermore,some sorts of physical exercises are really helpful to a person's mental and physical health.
8.0	Taking a yoga courses can help people release their stress and also can give woman a slimmer figure,which makes them more charming.
8.0	Swimming can improve the function of a person's lung and heart.
8.0	Running can provide people with strong muscles and even can extend people's longevity.
5.0	The significance of movies and books should also be mentioned.
8.0	If a person is too exhausted to working out,it will be better choice for them to stay at home and just read a novel or watching a classic movie.
8.0	Suppose you have been buried in a series of grueling work and stayed up late for a whole week,it could be a impossible task for you to take exercise.
8.0	Under this circumstance,have a glimpse of a interesting story or just watching a romantic film would provide you a better sense of relaxing.
0.0	In conclusion,there should be no prejudice against either of these two basic ways to relax onself.
0.0	As long as our society continues to progress , the importance of a healthy body will be on the rise.
0.0	Both woring out and watching movie or reading books are critical to a person's overall health amd each deserves our ever-lasting attention.
11.0	I can't agree more that we should never offer school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.
11.0	There follows three reasons.
11.0	First of all, the reward they get for high grade will lead them to pay more attention to getting money, rather than studying itself.
12.0	School is a significant place to help children build active and appropriate values.
8.0	So the lesson we'd like to convey should be we study because we enjoy the proccess of learning and the content of gaining knowledge.
8.0	We should be cautious enough when talking about money, let alone connecting study with money.
8.0	If rooted in their mind is the opinion that the aim of study is getting money, then we remind our children of something wrong.
6.0	Plus, the presence of money towards grade will make them much more nervous when facing examination,which have an adverse impact on their test behavior.
8.0	Just the evaluating system of grade will lay stress on the emotion of our little children.
8.0	Parents as we are, it is cruel for us to give them more anxiety by involving money.
8.0	Think of it, your children cannot concentrate their mind because if they donnot behave well, they will lose an amount of money which is a large sum to them.
8.0	How pity they are!
2.0	Last but no least, your reward will remind them that their high grade is everything, which, to some degree, contributes to their ignorance of personal character.
7.0	In their mind, your money implies thay only by getting good grade can they obtain the money they desire, and it is this indication that highlight the miportance of grade, in
12.0	I am totally for the opinion that people today are more willing to help the struggling strangers.
8.0	The phenomenon that the beggar are fewer and fewer in our contemporary society.
8.0	The reasons are not far to seek.
8.0	To begin with, more and more people know that giving coins to beggars can not help them throroughly, as another point of view, it is a kind of way to connive.
8.0	In addition, with the development of technological, the pace of life is increasing.
8.0	As a result, people do not have much time to stop and give others money.
8.0	Last but not least, our society is getting more and more equity.
8.0	Everybody get their own money from their own efforts.
8.0	So,we all believe that nobody can help you except yourself.
6.0	The words above mentioned some ideals in my perspective.
8.0	Now, I want to take one of my own experience for example.
8.0	In my childhood, my parents took me to the singing class.
8.0	There were nearly thirty students in that class.
8.0	So, it is very difficult for teacher to take care of every child.
8.0	However, I used to enjoy being the heart in all conditions.
7.0	When the teacher cou not take more care of me, I
10.0	Nowadays,
3.0	First of all, parents are pay more attention on children's school grades, and they ignore children's social abilities.
12.0	That couse the young people cannot realize that they are responsed to help their communities.
8.0	For example, when I was in high school.
12.0	Both my parents and teachers only focused on my grades rather than if I should help my communities.
12.0	More importantly, the school courses occupied nearly all my free time.
8.0	Finally, when I came to college.
3.0	I had enough time to join in to social service.
8.0	And many of my classmates were willing to volunteering.
6.0	With the development of  teachnology, more high-teach products are invented, such as samartphone and personl compertuer.
10.0	these are deeply attracted the young people.
11.0	In this day and age, what people concern is only around themselves.
11.0	In other words, they do not awake their consciousness   of what happened around the globe for they might think there is no connection between them and people involved in the events.
11.0	However, I do not think it is good.
11.0	My opinion wll be amplified by the benefits that knowing about the events around the globe can bring about.
6.0	First and formost, one can learn form the mistakes made by other people.
8.0	Provided that someone makes a severe mistake and it is broadcast in the television or some electronic devises, other people may thus be aware of the mistake and try to learn from it in his life.
8.0	For instance, one of my friends once read about a piece of news, which talked about a person who made a serious mistake and would be sent to prison soon.
8.0	However, she did not think that occurence as a severe thing, so she investigated it and searched much information concerning it.
8.0	However, since she is not a lawyer and were not quite acquainted with law before, she did not feel so disappointed.
8.0	Even so, she learned a lot from it and also knew how to defend.
8.0	As the example reveals, knowing about the events can bring about other benefits.
8.0	In addition, when one is doing his essay, he can cite the events extracted from the news.
8.0	This is mainly because people will always use some specific details to support his idea, and knowing more events means he has more citation which can be used in his essay.
8.0	A typical illustration of this can be seen in my sister's experience.
8.0	Once she was completing her assignments and could not find any supporting detail to comfirm her opinion.
8.0	Then came her father and told her to relax herself for a while.
8.0	Therefore, she started to watch the television.
8.0	And just then, she found the event happening at the other edge of the world could be cited in her homework.
8.0	She was so excited that she made up her mind that she must watch the news at least ten minutes per day to broaden her horizons.
8.0	As the instance demonstrates, people can find citation through knowing about the news.
2.0	In conclusion, I strongly believe that knowing about the events is of great significance, even if it will not affect our life in that people can not only learn from those mistakes mentioned in the events, but also find the proper citation from the events.
3.0	Such is human nature that parents want their child to perform well in school.
3.0	They know that the success in school reflects and predict the success in the future.
3.0	That is why they determine to do all they can to stimulate their child with the school work.
3.0	To be frank, I do not think that offering child money for each high grade is a goo way.
12.0	It may have some immediate feedback, but its destructive effects on the kid's life are enormous.
4.0	For an activity to be pleasurable, it should be done only for the sake of the activity itself.
8.0	This is what most religious and spiritual methods emphasize on.
8.0	If you are climbing a moutain just in order to reach the top, you must not enjoy the journey.
8.0	The climbing will be just a way to the end.
8.0	A child shoult be educated that what studying really mean to him .
8.0	It can not be a way to get award but improve himself.
8.0	Only when he knows this will he concentrate on studying.
4.0	In addition, the amount is not so easy to control.
10.0	A school-age child must develope a wastful habit under this stimulation.
4.0	Moreover, if a person is doing something only for money, he may cheat for it.
10.0	Money
2.0	To conclude, money is an alternative way to encourage child to do well, but it needs proper control.
11.0	Currently, a controversial topic has arouse a heated debate among people: is it better for colleagues or classmates to communicate in person than through email in order to do a project.
11.0	Some claim that communicating in person is much better because people can speak face to face.
11.0	However, i hold an oppsite view that using emails to finish a project can be better.
12.0	My point is elaborated as follow.
5.0	First, using emails to communicate can be more efficient to finish the project.
8.0	This is because by using emails to communicate people can have more time to collect information about the project, which would contribute to a all-round consideration.
8.0	If classmates or colleagues only communicate in person, they have to quickly make reaction to what others' saying, which is too hurry to come up with a conclusion.
8.0	For instance, my classmate Li, who used emails to communicate with his teammates,  finishing their work very efficienly on perparing a debating competition.
8.0	They had enough time to search the database and thought the question in a deep and wide consideration.
8.0	However, my team, who were the opposite with them, communicated in person.
8.0	My teammates always quickly drew a conclusion, whcih was confirmed  unreliable on the competition.
8.0	So, i think it is much more efficient to use the emails to finish a project.
5.0	Second, it will encourage colleagues of classmates who are shy to enter the team and share their initial thinking.
8.0	It is believed that many teams have some teammates who are so  shy that they rarely share their oppinios with others face to face.
8.0	By using emails to communicate, the shy person can have a chance to output their thinking and this is beneficial for doing a project because failure is always coming from with the suitation that some people follows others without their own thinking, teamwork continuing.
8.0	My brother John, who is really shy to talk to others, when doing his experiment with his teammates, he had some wonderful ideas in solving a problem.
8.0	However, because he was scared of talking to others, he didn't show the ideas to others whcih contributed the project slowly finished.
8.0	Now, his leader in this team has using emails to communicate, and John can easily show his ideas to others.
8.0	So, it is beneficial for dong a project to give shy people a chance to speak.
2.0	In summary, from what has benn discussed above, we can safely draw a conclusion that it is better to communicate through emails than in person in order to do a project.
11.0	In my opinion, parents offer money to their children when then get high gtade in school is a good idea.
11.0	And my reasons are as follows.
11.0	First of all, this behavior will let the teenagers realize the importance of study and behave better in school.
8.0	In addition, if a young person got good grade and received the reward, he can use the money to do what he like, for example, buying a pair of basketball shoes or some books.
8.0	And In this way, their interests could be improved and this will be wonderful to their creer.
8.0	However, some young men may use the money to buy games or other entertainment instructions, and parents may worry about this.
8.0	This problem could be solved if parents teach their children to cost the money scientificlly and make the money become more meaningful.
8.0	This will certainly improve children's ability to manage their money.
6.0	Some people may say this idea will make children think highly about money and study and can't realize the importance of other things such as mental health.
10.0	The problem also need parents and teachers to help them to understand there are much things more important than money and they have more abilities to exercise expect of study.
2.0	All in all, giving money to children who got high grade is a good idea though it has some problems.
10.0	So parents and teachers must try their best to solve the problems and let the idea has more good infuence.
10.0	Do  not  offer  extra money  for  good gade
3.0	Should we should offer your school-age children money for each high grade they get in school ?
12.0	I think the answer is no.
10.0	my  reasons are as belows :
5.0	First , for some lazy children, it  will make  them take it for granted .
9.0	Money becomes the target of study .
9.0	As time gose by ,they may not enjoy acquiring knowleage , but dedicated in eaning money,which is quite harmful to their growth.
5.0	Second , even your children are deligent,rewarding them with money could makes them feel stressed when they are having exams .
8.0	Especially in participating some vital exams ,for instance the college entrance examination .
8.0	At this time ,money is no more a benifit point but a heavy chain on their body .
8.0	They will be bothered by the expectation behind the money so that they can't get good grade
8.0	So
12.0	There is no doubt that I agree with the opinion that parents shoulr let childern make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes,because I was just been educated as this flow.
11.0	It is really help me to have a poissitive attitude to slove the really hard problems in my future life.
6.0	When I was a young boy,I was really loving to play with the fire and couristory about everything that can be burned.
8.0	"when I do this, I was to young to realize the dangerous include the ""palying""."
8.0	So,my mum mentioned me that it was really dangerous to playing with the fire, amd I should stop otherwise I would hurt myself.
8.0	But I don't think so,and always lighted the candleds,burned the alcohol and papers.
8.0	I was really enjoying it until one day,I bruned my bed,and also my left arm was bruned.
2.0	At this moment ,I realized that the dangerous things maybe very beautiful,but I should be always noticed the insight of the beauty things.
8.0	When I was older,I also play with fires, but I will do the encough measure to insure that the fire will not hurt myslef or anyone else, at the salme time I also could enjoy the beauty fire, the wonderful chemistry silomilens.
8.0	In fact, as far as I am concerned,the experience I played with fires did really teach me how to deal with the dangerous but beautiful things.
8.0	I will not afired them, but learn how to control them;I will not leave away from them ,but enjoy them in the safetly environment;I will not joujst it by other people's view,but learn it by myslef.
8.0	Thanks god my parents didn't just stop my to playing with the fire when i was a little child, but instead,let me try, and let me learn from it by myself.
3.0	I am disagree with it.
11.0	Because in my opinion, both of relax by watching a movie or reading a book  and doing physical exercise are good ways to relax.
11.0	The most different of them is where were you want to relax.
5.0	Relax by doing physical exercise are more likely relaxed our hert and mind.
8.0	I mean for example, if you had a long time studying or meeing.
8.0	You might feeling tired but your body doesnt tierd.
8.0	In this way ,you need doing physical exercise to relaxed your hert .
8.0	Because when you exercising , your mind is very relax.
8.0	You dont need thinking many things.
8.0	You just enjoy in physical exercise.
8.0	In this moment , time just like stop.
5.0	But relax by watching a movie or reading a book  are more likely to relaxed  our  body.
8.0	Just like ,when you fished your daily works or had a long traveling back to your hotel or home  .
8.0	You might feel your body and your mind very tired .
8.0	In this time, you need to watching a movie or reading a book to relax you mind.
8.0	And in this time,your body has also relaxed very well.
8.0	Because,when you reading or watching, your body are rest Any more, when you fished reading or watching movies.
8.0	You might feel very peaceful,and it will makes you have a great sleeping.
0.0	I always using this two ways relaxed my body and my mind.
0.0	And if you using them in a right way , both of them were having great influences .
0.0	So  i think this two ways were not having the best, the key way was how to using them in your different approach.
3.0	In China, it is very common for parents to reward their school-age children money if they performed well in their examination.
11.0	However, as for me, I don't agree with that and I believe that it is not a good idea to reward and encouage the children.
4.0	First of all, it is not for money that the children go to school, but for the knowledges and their interests.
8.0	In other words, the purpose of the children's studies is to explore the unknownness.
8.0	Therefore, if the children get high grade in school, they already have their reward, that is the master of the knowledges.
8.0	The parents should lead their children to develop their interets of the study rather than money.
4.0	The other reason that I am favor the idea to offer the school-age children money for their high grade is that money is not an effective motivation.
9.0	For example, if the children failed to perform well in school, they won't be able to have money from their parents.
9.0	Without money, they may loose the interests of study and quit their life.
4.0	Thirdly, offering money for high grade may failed and the reason is that the fulfillment of the children is limitless.
9.0	In other words, they may glad to receive money from the parents, but they may expected much more money when they grow up.
9.0	However, when the parents are not able to provide them , it will cause a lot of problems.
0.0	Finally, the reason that I am not agree with the idea that to offer children money for their each high grade is that I was born in a poor family and the reality is that my parents are not able to do that.
0.0	And I know that not only me, but also a lot of students' parents either able to do that.
0.0	Therefore, the reward of money will hurt their self-dignity and intigue their heart of envy.
0.0	For those reasons, I appose the idea to offer school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.
3.0	Nowadays, many parents are busy in their job and have less and less time to accompany with their children.
3.0	To this phenomenon, many people think that parents should use their spare time to pay games with children, while other believe that it is the best to use that time doing together that are related to schoolwork.
3.0	From my perspective, I prefer to spend my happy time on the sports or games with my parents.
12.0	Next, I have some reasons to support this.
4.0	First, as a student with heavy workload, they need to refresh their mind and they can not work hard if there is so much pressure.
10.0	At this time parents and childrencan play games or sports to release their pressure togther.
4.0	To illustrate, Mr.Smith, who was a teacher and always be busy and overburdened in the school, would always play basketball with his son after school.
10.0	Because he thought that the best and the most efficient way to reduce pressure is to play sports and which could help them concentrate better when they were going to working.
4.0	Second, in the spare time, playing games can sometimes give some inspiration to both parents and children and also they can develop a stronger logic.
8.0	If parents still dothe things related to the schoolwork with their children, it will make children feel bored and frustrated.
8.0	For example, my friend Mike was always struggling the geometry problems and could never understang what the teacher was saying in the class, and his parents were always busy in their job and no one could tutor him.
8.0	However, his father realized this point, and he spent his spear time to play computer games with Mike rather that desiged a plan to hime to practice.
8.0	As a result, MIke become more logic and be more interested in studying math.
0.0	In the conclusion, although parents may be busy and do not have enough time to accompany with their children, they can just consume a little time to play games with children.
0.0	Not only it can reduce children's pressure, but also it can develop a strong logic and give some inspiration to them.
0.0	I believe that is worthy.
3.0	Nowaday, many parents increase attention to s their school-age children's education grade.
3.0	To enhance children's grade, the parents come up a series of method.
3.0	The most arguement one is some parents offer their school-age children money for grade they get in school.
12.0	In my view, this is a good chioce for encouraging children to improve their grade.
6.0	The first reason drives me to indicate is that, it is an important ability for now children that is finacial management thinking.
8.0	It means that we need to teach our children how to manage their own money.
8.0	During this method that giving money as a prize, children will have a chance to manage their own money.
8.0	And parents will give children not only to their life but also their future.
8.0	For example, my mother used to give me some money as a prize when I was a children.
8.0	It cause me have to learn how to save money and use it.
10.0	That is why I agree wi
3.0	Recently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people: whether teachers should be paid at least as much as doctors, lawyers or business leaders are paid.
3.0	As far as I am concerned, teachers should be given at least equal remuneration as doctors, lawyers or business leaders.
6.0	To begin with, paying high salary to teachers can keep our society stable.
8.0	To illustrate, teachers have the duty to cultivate next generation of our world.
8.0	Whatever you do, you always need a teacher to teach you at the first time.
8.0	Moreover, becoming a doctors also need teachers thus it is ridiculous that teachers have lower salary than doctors.
8.0	However, if teachers are paid low salary which is lower than doctors or lawyers, people are willing to be doctors or lawyers rather than be teachers.
8.0	Thus, no one will teach our next generation and doctors, lawyers and business leaders will also disappear.
8.0	Then our society will lag behind.
0.0	To be followed, paying high salary to teachers can improve the world.
0.0	To be more specific, high salary can inspire teachers to improve their work.
0.0	Thus, students can get high quality education which will make them become elite.
8.0	More and more elite promote the progress of our world.
8.0	Nevertheless, if teachers only paid little money, they would not have motivation to give the students high quality education.
8.0	Consequenty, all the oocution of our world will lag behind.
3.0	Always many parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school, in order to spur their children to try their best to study hard for the award.
12.0	I am also treated by my parents in my early school life.
5.0	I don't think this is a good idea to simply define whether this educational method is right and effcient or not.
8.0	It depends on the child's identity.
8.0	To those who are able to get a high grade, the lack of interests to study is a trouble problem.
8.0	Their intelligence entirely can make them a scholar, but most of children prefer to having funnny activities, not boring curriculum.
8.0	And everyone tend to be not willing to be busy and tired, but unfortunately study is one of the activities that take us tired.
8.0	To these students, some physical award is effcient and helpful.
8.0	Of course, each family has different funding condition, the money must be controlled within it that the parents can afford it.
5.0	On the other hand, some children who can't get high grade is not because of the interest, they had studied hard, but the profit is low.
8.0	Perhaps the false study method leads to the consequence.
8.0	As their parents, rarely providing family scholarship with children is not a effcient choice.
8.0	If these parents can deeply disguish them, and help their children with their more experience, I believe these students can improve their grade unprecentedly.
7.0	The action that parents offer their school-age childre money for each high grade they get in school is
3.0	With the accelerating development of our society, the public and government have more strict standard for university students.
11.0	Some people contend that university students should not only learn about their major's knowleage, but also other courses.
11.0	Many people of them think history courses are necessary for university students.
11.0	Because  nowadays more and more young people do not know about history.
11.0	But I strongly believe that the history courses seem to be a burden for university students.
6.0	Firstly, university students have few time and energy to study a course out of their major courses.
8.0	To be specific, today's university students spend a lot of time in their major courses, especially the engineers.
8.0	With the development of technology, some engineer courses become harder and harder.
8.0	The students face the most complex problems ever before.
8.0	So they spend much more time in their major courses than several years before.
8.0	In that situation, the extra history courses would certainly take negative effects to the students.
8.0	Some students even spend their rest time to struggle for their history credits, that might cause some body diseases.
8.0	Moreover, if the students do not spent their rest time, their reduce their study time for major courses, that might hurt their professional abilities which are important after graduation.
1.0	On top of that, university students gain few benifits from the history courses.
1.0	In other words, the university students who do not  major in history do not spent enough time to have a comprehensive impression of history.
8.0	That leads misunderstand of some historical truth, students are likely to have a false attitude towards to some events.
8.0	In China, their are many young energetic people who only read few history textbooks are extremely negative towards Japanese.
8.0	The negative attitude leads them to do some unreasonable riots, such as destroying the Japanese made cars in the streets.
8.0	That caused big decreases.
3.0	Universally it is quite a average phenomenon that parents are accustomed to preparing everything for their children especially when they are in rebellous age or too young to handle things.
12.0	Furthermore, for numerous Chinese parents, children are what they live for,no wonder they woould rather expense every penny to get a promising future for their children.
12.0	However,from my perspective,it is too indulging for kids if parents do not let children make mistakes.
6.0	There is a saying that failure is the mother of success.
8.0	People will only learn from their miastakes not in success,needless to say children.
8.0	In the process of growing up,it is time for them to study and  learn from failure or mistakes.
8.0	If parents take that crucial part out of the process,they will enjoy less lesson of what are supposed to shown for them.
8.0	What is more, it is also impossible for parents to loo after their children for their entire life,which means they wil make mistakes sooner or later,and then you will not be able to protect him from hurt.
8.0	Therefore, what parents ought to do when children make mistakes is encouraging them and cheering them up,so as to help them gain more meaningful experience,instead of stop them from making mistakes which will only lead to temporary warmth.
8.0	Of course,you should not comprehend it for being cruel to children ,cause it is not simply superfical love ,it is deeper and greater care and attachment in the long run.
8.0	Besides,it is acknowledged that eagle moms throw their very own kids in the hill just to force them to learn to fly.
8.0	It is of course ,for good purpose,that they do such things.
8.0	Equally, men parents,should let their children make mistakes and help them correct before too late.
3.0	There is no doubt that communities play a vital role in people's daily lives.
3.0	However, nowadyas whether young people spend enough time to helping the communities or not is controversial.
11.0	In my opinion, I think young people today indeed do not give enough help to the communities.
5.0	First of all, young people nowadays do not have enough free time to help others.
8.0	As the stress of young people is becoming higher and higher, no matter those students in schools or those people at work both have too much things to do, as a result, it will be tough for them to find sufficient free time to help their communities.
8.0	For instance, when I was studied in the university, I had so much things to deal with every day that I even did not  have any free time to do other things.
8.0	I had to pay much attention to my courses and it was also necessary for me to participate in many activities organized by the sports club and also sometimes I would join in some competitions like debate which needed a lot of preparation.
8.0	By all of these, it was really hard for me to find enough time to help my communities as many times they came to asking for my help what I could say is suggesting them to look for others' help.
5.0	Second, now more young people is more apathy and more likely to enjoy their life alone rather than spending time on helping others.
8.0	With the development of the technology, now it is possible for a person to only use high-tech devices like mobile phones or computers to live alone without others' company which make people more unconcerned than before.
8.0	To illustrate, my cousin used to study with me in the same university.
8.0	He was very apathy that he could just sat their with playing his mobile phone for a whole day.
8.0	It was not necessary for him to get on with others or give help when others need.
8.0	When we all participated in an activity needing team work, he refused to join in and did not give any help to us group because of the lack of team spirit.
8.0	Thus, nowadays many times young people are not used to helping others, that is why they do not spend enough time giving help to their communities.
2.0	All in all, for all these reasons, I indeed believe that young people now do not spend enough time helping the communities.
3.0	Recently，there is a discussion about helping the strangers.
12.0	And most people are more likely to help the strangers who are struggling.
12.0	As for me,I agree with them and I will also help the strugging people.
6.0	In China,helping others is a traditional virtue,espcially when they are in problems.
10.0	In our childhood,we have heard a large number of stories about it,which is that a warmheated man helped a poor man ,and after many years,the poor man became  rich and he had still remembered who had helped him.
3.0	Can you imagine what things would like to be if there are numerous cars which will occupy everywhere in our cities?
3.0	Can you guess what the consequence would appear if we living in a place which will be filled with carbbon dioxide and mog from cars?
3.0	Both of these answers are evidently easy for us to guess.
3.0	If the amount of cars increase unstoppablly in the existing 20years, our city will definitely turn into a nighmare.
12.0	So the number of cars could not increase but decrease in someways.
5.0	Few things can be more horrible than a whole city will be occupied by all kinds of cars in future years, simply because the more cars, the more traffics, and then there are more traffic accidents.
10.0	All of know what the streets likely to be when we are on our ways home after we finished our work--Only cars on the streets, and we cannot move anymore in such a heavy traffic circunstance if we drive home., and this would steal much time of us without any reason.
5.0	And things can be worse that there will be more carbon dioxide in the future if more cars come out, and our plannet will be warmer and warmer which could lead to many kinds of nature disasters.
10.0	And the mog from cars can only be harmful to our health, even could cause deseases.
2.0	So, our scientist or inventors would not allow this kind of disaster happen.
10.0	This is because in such a high technology era, we could invent the traffic vehicles in air, we can build more subways, which could effectively control the nubmber of the car in the future.
3.0	Recently, a controversial topic has roused a heated debate: whether young people today are more likely to invest their time and efforts in improving the world than young people in the past?
11.0	As far as I am concerned, young people today are more willing to try their best to improve the world.
6.0	To begin with, young people today have the demand to improve the world.
8.0	To be more specific, getting attention from world is a great satisfication for young people today since they are watching the world all the time through internet.
8.0	What's more, young people today can use internet to find the information they need and know which can help them improve the world.
8.0	In this case, young people tend to participate in things that change world in order to get more attention.
8.0	On the contrary, in the past, young people cannot know what is happening in the world and they did not know how to change the world.
8.0	So they were not aware of that they can improve the world.
8.0	Consequently, they were more likely to invest their time on their daily life.
8.0	For example, most of the young people nowadys have did some volunteer which also improve the society in some ways.
8.0	However, in the past, less people did volunteer.
2.0	To be followed, young people have time to improve the world.
8.0	To illustrate, young people today do not need to worry about how to make living since the society progress.
8.0	They can find a job to make living easily and then they have more free tiem than before.
8.0	In order to make a good use of this time, they are more willing to invest it to improve the world.
8.0	However, in the past, people always need to consider how to earn more monery to support their family.
8.0	They often need to work all days and did not have any time to invest.
3.0	Recently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people: whether your job has more influence on your happiness than social life does?
3.0	Opinions vary from person to person.
11.0	Some people claim that your job has less effect on you happiness than social life does.
11.0	However, I would stand on their opposite side and I believe that your happiess are more influenced by your job rather than social life.
12.0	My viewpoints can be elaborated as follows.
5.0	Firstly, your job can bring money to you and these money can make you happy.
8.0	As we all know, the salary of our job are our motivation of working.
8.0	If we can get lots of money every month, we could save these money and do any we want.
8.0	However, if we are always worried about problem that whether our money is enough to survive, we would feel very stressed out and unhappy.
8.0	For example, I was a music teacher in a high school two years ago and I could recieve six thousands RMB every month.
8.0	I saved all of my salary and went to Chongqing where is a beautiful place.
8.0	I took many photos and ate many delicious food.
8.0	I felt very happy.
5.0	Secondly, your job is nearly one-third of a day, and if you feel unhappy when you work, your one-third day would be unhappy.
8.0	When people graduate from school, all of us need to work every day  and our job become very essential part of our whole day and life.
8.0	If we work very hard and we get reward, we would feel a sense of accomplishment because our efforts recieve feedback.
8.0	Thus, our overall mood would be lifted.
8.0	For example, my sister graduated last year and she went to a advertising company.
8.0	She often complained to me that she felt very upset and unhappy, because she dislike her job and her boss always criticed her.
1.0	To put it in a nutshell, I firmly think your happiness are more effected by you job.
1.0	This is not only it can bring money to you and meet your needs, but also it can influence you one-third day and whole life.
11.0	With the social process, there are a large variety of may of working to enable job hunters to choose.
12.0	Some prefer to work at their own house instead of the workplace offered by their company; some would like to spend three days per week on work though it takes above ten hours to work everyday.
12.0	As far as I am concerned, it is advisble to engage in five days a week because I just spend about eight hours on work.
6.0	To begin with, working shorter hours everyday help people maintain health.
8.0	Since it is not uncommonly known that long period of working would lead a sedentary lifestyle.
8.0	This means people would pay less attention to physical activity.
8.0	Last week, I heard a news about a writer died because of working for long time.
8.0	Because she had no time to participate in exercise, she already suffered from chronic diseases.
8.0	This event tells us if people can spend time strengthening their legs and arms or making aerobic activities rather than sitting in front of computer screen, they would keep fit.
8.0	Therefore, for the sake of physical healthy, people should choose a job for working shorter time.
2.0	what is more, people working five days for shorter time could enjoy their colorful daily life.
8.0	If people have to go to work at once after waking up and go back home when they finish their work, they would not have time hang out the department store with their friends or do the household chore every day.
8.0	In other word, they are more likely to feel boring owning to lack of entertain.
8.0	This point is illustrated by a example of my friend, Lily.
8.0	She very sick of her last job where she work three day a week for eleven hours.
8.0	She quited because she had no time to care for her baby.
7.0	Now she do a job for shorter time every day, she can spend more time with her children, which enablet
3.0	Have you ever seen that some people had different opinion when teachers were instructing?
11.0	Some prople in the society think that when teachers say sonething that against our own opinion, people must point out the mistake or say nothing in order to avoid some trouble.
11.0	When it comes to the opinion that people can communicate with teachers after class if teathers say something that incorrect in our opinion.
11.0	There are three reaons that help me to explain my opinion.
5.0	First of all, talking with teachers after class is the most effective way to claim our opinion to teachers.
8.0	I mean communicating with teachers when they are not busy can lead teachers pay more attantion to what you are saying.
8.0	Also, it won't delay the class schedule.
8.0	For example, my math teacher is a strict person and he is glad to answer his students' question.
8.0	If some people people point out some question when he was teaching, he had to delay the class schedule in order to solve this problem.
8.0	Also, he won't pay mush attantion because he wanted to finish his class schedule.
8.0	Instead, if students asked him some incorrect point after the class, he would be concentrated because he was free.
8.0	Also, he can correct it in the next class.
5.0	Furthermore, if students interrupt and correct the point when teachers are teaching, teacher may be very angry and impatient for this behavior.
8.0	The reason is that it is a motion that isn't respect for teachers.
8.0	For instance, my English teacher is a impatient person.
8.0	One day, one of her students point out a mistake when she was teaching.
8.0	She was really angry and she can't
12.0	I think this is a pretty good idea.
8.0	First,money is one of the most directly way for to make kids happy.
8.0	Many parents try to discribe bright future to encourge their kids to learn but in vain.
8.0	That is because kids cannot understand many things which adult concern.
8.0	Money will be a execllent motivation for kids to study well.
8.0	For example,you tell your little son about all the glory and advantages after entering IVY,and turn out that they do not pay any attention to that which is too far away from them.
8.0	So why not use something they can accept easier to make them do right things?
8.0	Second,by doing so will teach kids a social rules:you cannot have anything untill you pay for it.
8.0	Knowing nothing comes free mature a kid rapidly.
8.0	They will aware that only self-effort can bring them good life,and parents and anyone else cannot offer help and love to you forever.
8.0	Thirdly,teaching kids to use money correctly is important.
8.0	After finding the money they get from 5 Aplus cannot even afford to something they normally purchase without much thinking,kids will defintely start to think about the importance of money and how to use the money wisely.
8.0	In conclusion,offering money to school kids for high grade can help both parents and kids themsevles.
3.0	When i was walking my dogs in the park nearby, I saw a mettlesome old man running slowly with sneakers and sport pant.
3.0	In the meanwhile, a young man with suit passed me, looks tired and down hearted.
3.0	This interesting contrast leads me to think whether young men need less exercise than those elderly people.
11.0	In my opinion, I think it's crucially important for younger person to has more exercise than the older.
5.0	First but not least, exercise is a excellent way for young people to build up a strong body.
8.0	As we all know, comtemporary social life has quick rhythm.
8.0	Young workers need to get up at six o'clock and go back home until 8P.M.
8.0	Therefore, they spend too much time on working with those harmful techiques that have strong radiation to their body, such as computers, smart phones, or electronic books, which would lead them to a result that their eyes and other organs can be harmed and they are likely to have serious diseases in the future.
8.0	And if they have time to exercise, they will be able to reduce the bad imfluence that those electronic devices have caused to their bodies since those exercise, such as running, rope skipping, yoga, could help them keep fit.
8.0	As a result, compare to those old people who don't has much work to deal with, young people who needs to work all day long should exercise more often.
5.0	Moreover, i think exercise is a good way to release pressure.
8.0	Take myself as an example, when I was in high school, I needed to study for eight hours a day in my classroom and then went back home to finish homework.
8.0	Since my homework is hard to deal with, I always need a couple of hours to finish it.
8.0	From day to day, I started feeling very tired and stressed out because I was studying all the time but didn't have a way to discharge my pressure.
8.0	However, my friend Lisa told me that she always do some exercise before going to bed twice a week and it's a good way to relax.
8.0	So i decided to try it, and the result is sensational.
7.0	Thereby, it's suitable for
11.0	Making decisions can be a crucial part in our daily life.
11.0	Some of the them may have a great influence on our future.
11.0	Whether young people in the present time and age have no influence on the important far-reaching decisions on our society can be still a controversial topic.
11.0	Some people believe that the young cannot have something to do with making that kind of decisions due to the lack of experience and knowledge, while, as for me, I hold the idea that our young people have the ability to influence that decisions.
5.0	First of all,  with the development of our society, people nowadays have many metheods to explain your ideas to others.
8.0	So, in this way, many approchs are provided for young people to affect others.
8.0	For example, as far as I remember, my  cousin who is concerned about the city's futrue plan of protecting the environment always wrote articles to express his own idea on many websites and his blog.
8.0	It was because his words were so creditable and his plans were so sophsicated that finally he had many fans online.
8.0	And then, he and his fans wrote a letter about their advice of that plans, which were accepted by the government of our city.
8.0	As a result, my cousin showed his influence on decision-making.
5.0	Second, as my point of view, our government is more likely to listen to the young.
8.0	That means our young people can take part in the process of making decision.
8.0	Let me take my experience as an example.
8.0	When I was in high school, I was selected as a representative to attend a important meeting about the future buget in our city.
8.0	In that meeting, I found that half of people who attended to that meeting were students rangeing from high school to college.
8.0	This could never happen before and the adult had the priority.
7.0	In a nutshell, because of more ways to express young people's idea and
11.0	Nowadays, many people they will think that they do the single thing for a long time is enough, because they think they need to keep on doing it and it's very easyto do it.
11.0	But, I don't think so, we need do more types of tasks to make us more enjoyable, because we can we can know more things and we will not be afraid of the differet barrierswhen we face.
5.0	First, doing different types of things can broden our mind.
8.0	To illustate, when I study at the school, I will have six subjects need to learn, but I'm not tired or frustated.
8.0	Because by doing these,  I can get more academic knowledge, which can open my mind and develop my intresets, also it's a good chance for me to exchange the ideas between me and my friends, we can help each other to solve the problems and we will be more efficient to study on other subjects.
8.0	So I think it can make enrich my mind and make my life colorful rather than boring.
5.0	Second, I can  make more friends who may have the same interests with me by doing different tpyes of tasks.
8.0	For example, I have an uncle, who is a lawyer, but he not work only for his lawyer's task and he is also asport amatuer, and he always spend his time on doing sports.
8.0	I ask him why doing thie.
8.0	He said when he play sports with other people they can develop the ability of team work and use this method on his work, the can also make frieand when he play sports, the friends is that when he face the difficulties who will encourage him to overcome the barriers.
0.0	In conclusin, by doing different types of tasks, we can open my mind and make more friends to let our life colorful and enjoyable.
0.0	When you feel tired, you can attemp to do something which you never try it.
0.0	You will feel amazing and happy when youin this process!
12.0	Living in the modern society fulled with pressure and fiecrce competions,we are always in need of much relaxion.
11.0	Fortunately,with the boom of the economics and technology,there exists more and more chances for us to lesson our pressure and tiredness in order to enjoy our life.
11.0	But there is a discussion about the better way to relax.
11.0	Some people think it's better to relaxby watching a movie or reading a book while others propose that it's better to do physicial exercise.
11.0	In my opinion ,I prefer the former one.
10.0	There are several causes following.
5.0	From my perspective,first of all,after doing physical exercise,we are more likely to be tired and are even sleepy.
9.0	As a result,we need extra time to sleep which decrese the efficiency of relaxaion.
9.0	What's more,if we choose to watch a movie or read a book,we can be relaxed anywhere and anytime,instead of wasting time to find parterners or places to do exercise.
5.0	Secondly,some physicial exercise may cost a lot to rent or buy the equipments,which we may not be easily access to them.
10.0	While we can spend little in watching movies and reading books.
0.0	What's more,it may be not suitable to do exercise for the people who are in a bad physical conditon.
0.0	Howerer,we can be more safer and relaxed to read and watch movies.
0.0	I can also enjoy the time.
12.0	I think it's not a good idea for parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade or mark they get to school.
5.0	First,before college or university, money dos not have any realtionship with the scores, grades and marks that school-age children earn by study.
8.0	These children had not clearly understand what the money is, what the use of the money is, what can we deal with the money correctly, these are important aspects for children.
8.0	If they  use the money without any purpose,this could be really harmful for him or her and his or her families.
8.0	They can use out his or her families' money.
8.0	If their s no money that his or her families can offer,children could do some economical crime action.
8.0	Like stealing,robbery,murdury,smuggling drugs or any other crimes that have connect with the money.
5.0	Second,parents should renew their thiking.
8.0	Should we give school-age children money or not?
8.0	You have to think about all the situation and th result of you make up a decision.
8.0	Any decision can be connect with you survive of your family or die out.
8.0	You have to be really careful that your children will get naughty after you offer money to your high grade or mark children.
8.0	They spend too much money,children could became demanding to their parents.
8.0	Or they could became greedy on money.
8.0	If they  still greedy on muney aafter get job and grow up,terrible result will happed on them.
8.0	recently in PRC,many Centeral People's Government(CPG)'s officers  and the members of Commist Party of China(CPC) were sent into prison orthey were executed.
8.0	Because of what?
8.0	Greedy on money!!!
8.0	It's against the law on greeding on money in ChinaTheres a good saying in China:Money is a weapon.
8.0	It can protect yourself,but it can also harm yourselves.
1.0	In the end,I suggest that parents better not to give the school-age children money.
1.0	It' bad!!!
10.0	DON'T DO IT!!!
3.0	I don't think that parents offer their children money for high grade is good.
12.0	In my opinion, we shouldn't give children the sign that they study for money.
6.0	We should tell children that study is for yourself to gain knowledge in the beginning.
8.0	The purpose of study is not for money but for knowledge itself, and there is no doubt that knowledge is vital for us for the future.
8.0	"Therefore, if parents give their children the feeling that they study for money, when they don't have the ""money"" motivation one day, they will not want to study anymore."
8.0	Take the most of Chinese parents as an example.
8.0	They often offer their children material awards for getting good grades, and it did make a lot of improvment.
8.0	However, when their kids go to the college, they suddenly loss the motivation to study, and they get low grades in college even they fail the exams.
3.0	These days, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debated among people: whether people will spend less time cooking and preparing food in twenty years than they do today.
3.0	From my perspective, people will spend more time on the food preparing and cooking.
12.0	My point will be elaborated as follows.
5.0	Firstly, the scientific diet need people to select foof carefully.
8.0	People will pay more attention on the scientfic living especially the scientific food, so they will spend plenty of time designing a diet and make sure that every food have advantages to human instead of bad influence.
8.0	Also the process of cooking need enough time to guarantee that all the bacteria is killed.
8.0	On the contrary, todays'people  often just buy the food material and then cook them without the scientific matching and required time to make the food done completely.
8.0	consequently, this would have a bad influence on the people today.
8.0	For example, with the develop of technology, a research conducted by Harvard un iversity shows that people can use the nutrition detector to monitor the vitamin in the food to create the most healthy food in their home.
8.0	So with the fashion to make scientific food, people in twenty years would spend more time one food.
5.0	Secondly, people would have more spare time in twenty years, whcih would guarantee that they have enough time spending on the food preparation and cooking.
8.0	In the future, people would have more spare time because the advanced technology would take a great amount of works.
8.0	With the robots and the computer to control most of the jobs, people do not have the stress to deal with the work.
8.0	Consequently, people would develop the cooking as a hobby so they would spend as much as  possible because they enjoy the cooking process and the cooking process would give them happiness and relaxation.
8.0	For example,  people in twenty years would come back home at a early time or even they only need to deal with the stuffs at home, receiving some emails.
8.0	So they can spend plenty of time preparing the food and cooking to enjoy the relaxing environment.
8.0	On the contrary, you can imagine that people today would only buy some quick food or deal with the cooking quickly with so much stress.
2.0	All in all, people in twenty years would spend more time on cooking.
3.0	Awarding school-age children can stimulate them to study harder and let them taste the sweetness of their success.
3.0	But it depends on the form that parents choose.
3.0	Because some unexpective results may came along when the tendency of study is twisted.
11.0	Take this brief evidence into consideration, I have to say that I'm against the opnion that parents offer their scholl-age children money for each high grade they get in school.
10.0	And here states some reasons down below.
5.0	Interest comes first.
8.0	Stimulation can make a difference in a short period of time, but as the road suspends in our children's  life, what takes the indesipensable place is interest.
8.0	So instead of showing them money to push them to work hard, which unfortunely is a lifestyle of a grown-up who has lost his curiosty in life, we should fuel their interest in gaining knowledge.
8.0	Take my deskmate as an example, his parents read books when he was little.
8.0	However, his parents always ceased to read during the exciting pattern in order to raise up his curiosty for more.
8.0	Now he's in good grade, forced to study by nobody but himself.
8.0	When a child strongly intend to learn something, this child's future can be bright as the balcony.
5.0	Never let a child grow into a man who lusts for fortune.
8.0	What my mom used to convince me is that when a man lost his essential characters, he lost it all.
8.0	When money becomes the only reason that a kid learns some stuff, how much fun does he miss?
8.0	A businessman I used to know comes to my mind.
8.0	He only cares about money, when it is beyond the topic of money and profit, he just doesn't care at all.
8.0	What he told me is that his parents tried to stick the thought that money wins into his brain.
8.0	There's so much entertainment in the world, don't blind your children's eyes by money!
0.0	So thos are my thoughts I'd like to share.
0.0	Study should be pure.
0.0	Let your kids understand this.
3.0	Have you ever selected sciences in university just want to escape the history class?
12.0	Nowasays, there are increasing students think the history class is boring and do not want to choose the history class, so they try to select a distant field which could cut these classes.
11.0	However, I think it is really important for students to study history, no matter what their field of study is.
12.0	The history can be classified as the history of culture, the history of ecnomic and the history of policy.
12.0	And these are all really necessary to ourself and our life.
4.0	Firstly, the history of culture is significent to learn.
10.0	The university students are the descendents of their country, so it is their obligation to inherit the culture, and remember the traditions of their countries.
4.0	In addition, learning the history of the ecnomic of the world is useful for the univerisity students.
9.0	After graduating the university, these students need to seek jobs.
9.0	So they can have a proper orientation about their jobs after learning the tendacy of the ecnomy.
4.0	Finally, knowing the history of the policy is fundamental as an excellent citizens.
10.0	The country and the world are like our homes, we have obligation to know what happened in the past.
2.0	Therefore, do not feel disguised toward history class.
3.0	Parents today mor elikely to help their children becaus ethey want their children to be more successful than other, many parents already planed how their children' s lives go before their childrens were borned.
3.0	With this caring about children's lives, children today tend to just follow the decisions made by their parents.
11.0	Thus, i believe that children today tend are less able to make decisions about their own lves than before.
5.0	Firstly, most people in the past time are poor, hunger and poverty is their major concern.
8.0	Parents just did not have the time to care about their kids since they need to work hard to make a life.
8.0	Thus, since parents back then were too busy, they did not care about how their kids's decisions.
8.0	For instance,  in my mother's family backcthen, my grandparents were working day and night.
8.0	My grandparents's only cared about how to make sure that hmy mom and my uncles had enough food, my grandparents did not care about whether my mom and my uncles are going to university or even if they are going to have a job, what their jobs will be.
8.0	Thus, since my grandparents did not have the time to help them make decisions, my mother and my uncles had to make future plans by their own.
8.0	However, nowadays, since we are weathier and our parents are thinking more about our future, they are more likely to plan for us.
5.0	Furthermore, todays world is with a large variety of things but the days before the world is simplier.
8.0	We have way more choices than the past and young people will sometime get confuse by what are they going to be.
8.0	For example, in days before young children are make plan just base on how much money they will make or whethe rtheir decision will be benefitial to their contries or families, however, today we have a higher standard, maybe we just want to do things base on our interests.
8.0	Therefore, we need the help from our parents since they are more experienced so they can help us make better decision.
8.0	Thus, the decisions young people need to make is simpler in the past than today.
8.0	So today's people need more help from parents to come out with a good decision.
2.0	Overall, due to the condition in our society and wealthness of our lives, I think the people in the past make more independent decisions.
3.0	Can the strain of the work renders us boring and tired?
3.0	Is the high stress work good for our health?
3.0	As a common employee of my company, I prefer to have the spare time about several hours everyday.
3.0	Because from my perspective, the spare time in everyday is good for our health.
3.0	At the same time, the fewer working time in everyday enhance our working efficiency.
3.0	So I would like to choose the lifestyle that working five days a week for shorter hours.
6.0	On the one hand, the shorter times work enhance the quality of our body.
8.0	To be more convincible, if we just work 4-5 hours a day, we will have large quantity of time to do some sports and arrange some appointments and so on.
8.0	These leisures not only are good for our health, but also enhance our passion of the life.
8.0	There is no better illustration to prove this idea than the instance of myself.
8.0	In our company, some part of employees only work three days in a week.
8.0	However, they need to do a 9-hours-work everyday, so they are extremely tired and looks weak.
8.0	As a result, in the later two days leisure, they can only spend most part of time to sleep.
8.0	They not only can not spend their spare time to travel or anything, but also do not do any sports, so they have worse condition to face their work.
8.0	But for me, I spend 3-4 hours to do some sports in my leisure everyday.
8.0	I not only strengthen my muscle and legs, but also do not feel tired in my work time.
0.0	On the other hand, the shorter times work enhance our working efficiency.
0.0	To be more specific, if we work 8-10 hours a day, we will feel extraodinarily tired and the efficieny will be very low in the latter 3-4 hours.
0.0	However, consider myself for instance, I work 5 hours a day, I can spare no effort to do my assignment everyday.
10.0	This is the condition that our leaderships want to see.
3.0	What should we do when somebody said something wrong in a meeting?
3.0	Should we correct them or should we let it go?
3.0	If we want to correct the mistake the person said, when should we correct the mistake?
11.0	In my opinion, I will choose to correct their mistake after the person who made the mistake have done the speech.
12.0	By doing this, the people who made the mistake will realize their problem and correct this mistake in the future, also this person will feel a sense of respect since we did not poinrt out their problem infront of others which will causes the person to feel bad.
5.0	Firstly, if we pint out the mistake the person made after all others are gone, they will feel that we have the respect toward them.
8.0	Interrupting others is very rude, and since the person who is speaking is our leader or teacher, so we need to respect them .
8.0	For example, once when I was taking a math class last years when I was a high school student in America, my teacher made a mistake when calculating a formation and i realized that.
8.0	I told him the mistake after everybody else were gone and he was really appreciated and he corrected this mistake in the next class.
8.0	After that, he always decribed me as respectful and smart.
8.0	So, people should point out the mistake a teacher or a leader made privately to let them both realize the mistake and feel a sense of respect.
5.0	Furthermore, interrupting the teacher or the leader to tell they were wrong or just leave the mistake like this are not good choices.
8.0	By interrupting them, they will feel we are intend to embaress them or we do not have a respect to them but if we do not point out their mistake, they might be continous to make the mistake and they will mislead many people.
8.0	For example, my friend in a Chinese class last year pointed out a mistake made by their teacher during class by interrupting their teacher, after that, his teacher kept treated he really bad, when he was in high school, there another teacher in his class made a mistake and he just left the mistake like that, later on his teacher was kept making the smae mistake over and over agian.
8.0	Therefore, we  better not not either interrupt to point out the mistake or say nothing.
3.0	Recently, an interesting question has aroused a heated debated among public: whether teachers should be paid at least as much as doctors, lawyers pr business leaders are paid.
3.0	Opinions are vary from person to person, some people claims that they actually get the as much salary as doctors, lawyers or bussiness leaders are gotten.
3.0	However, I would stand on the opposite side.
11.0	I believe that they could have diffenert number of salary.
5.0	Firstly, a business leader should be paid more than others because they would mak more contributions to the soecity.
8.0	Because the business leader offers many people job, which can support many families.
8.0	That is to say a business leader should get more wages becasuse of their contributions.
8.0	In contrast, if a teacher is paid more than a business leader, there will be less companies because most people are willing to become a teacher.
8.0	For example, a business leader can arrange a company to make money more than their salary because of their work.
8.0	But if they get a less wages, there will be less motivation for them to become a business leader.
5.0	Secondly, we should pay somebody through their contributions instead of their jobs.
8.0	This is because when we make a good progress in some fields, we should be paid more than others.
8.0	That is to say not all the teachers should be paid more than doctors or lawyers.
8.0	On the contrary, if the teachers are paid more than other jobs, they may be distracted by the money.
8.0	For example, there are many professioners who teach in the universities.
8.0	Some of them are interested in earning moeny.
8.0	So they would conduct many experiments that can sae to companys for much money instead of what we need.
8.0	Then they will be misled by the money.
2.0	To put it in a nutshell, I firmly disagree that we should paid teacher at least as much as doctors or others.
7.0	This is not only because we should consider their contributions but also because we should take their proformance into s
3.0	Recently, there is a heated discussion about society.
12.0	some people believe that young peopel today have no influence on the decisions that the future of society as a whole, because young people do not have experience.
12.0	However, others hold a dissimilar viewpoint that young people can competent in many job in the society.
12.0	As for me, i agree with the latter one.
12.0	My reasons examples are listed as follows.
6.0	One reason why i am in favor of my perspective is that young people can competent in many job in society.
9.0	this is because young people are curious about the unknow, which help them want to try all different job.
9.0	A good example of this is my brother
11.0	I don't think it is a good ideal to offer school-age children money for each high mark they get in school.
12.0	There is no denying that these rewards can encourage students to study harder and get higher grades.
11.0	But it will make them form an idea that ifas long as they complete anything well, they should be paid with wnderful award, which is harmful and unrealistic.
6.0	When I was staying at home in summer holiday, my younger sister, who was reading in primary school, came to my home everyday to get help for her study and she asked me if I can  teach her friend chemistry as a private teahcer.
8.0	Thinking that I have enough time, I agreed.
8.0	Her friend told me that if she can gain high score in exams, her father will give her money to buy anything she want.
8.0	One day, I was lucky to be invited by the girl's parents to have dinner with them.
8.0	In the restunant, the girl asked her father to buy ice cream for her although she was still having a cold.
8.0	Of course her father disagree.
8.0	Realizing her requirement could not be satisified, as a result, she began to count her exam results one by one.
8.0	"Even a small quiz in class could be her example and a ""good reason"" to buy herself an ice cream."
8.0	She even ask me to tesitfy for her good perforemance in my class.
8.0	Her father finally give up and bought her an ice cream, as the whole atmosphere became very embarrasing.
0.0	In my opinion, giving money as a reward for students' hogh grade is not a good opinion.
0.0	Parents can bring their children for an ice cream or a box of sugar to praise them when they perform perfect in an important exam.
0.0	Don't let children think they can gain whatever they want just because of there high grades.
0.0	It will make them always have excuese for get anything.
12.0	I think this thing has two sides.
11.0	One is good,and the other is bad.
12.0	This thing has some advantages.
12.0	On one hand ,this can encourage their children to study more hard-working in the school and be more self-confidence in the class.
8.0	For example,if my mom promised to give me money for each high grade i get in the school,i will be very happy and i will have more power when i study.
8.0	I will never think study is boring.
8.0	On other side,i can learn how to collect money by myself.
8.0	I will control myself to use less money and use this money to help other helpless children for their school,books,clothes and so on.
6.0	Offering money to their school-age children for each high grade(mark) they get in the school also has some drawbacks.
8.0	For example,some children want to have more money,they will think some bad methods to get more money.
8.0	Such as copy other students' test paper to get higher grades,use mobile to find the answers to the questions and some other ways.
8.0	For some children,if they the money,they can't contrl themselves.
8.0	They use the money to play games or go to some places to play with friends,but not use it in the good ways.
2.0	So ,i think if the children can control themselves ,the parents can offer their school-age children money for each higf grade (mark) they get in school.
3.0	As we all know, money plays an significant role in our socity, and it is the base of one's living.
11.0	And for a children, studying hard to get a high grade means that they will have access to better education in the futyre and when they graduate, better jobs are waiting for them.
11.0	Hence, in my humble opinion, it is right and reasonable for patriarch to offer their school-age childre money for high grade they get in school.
12.0	The reaons are as follow.
5.0	First of all, money can stimulate children to study more hard.
8.0	It is universally acknowledged that children's thoughts do not formed fully.
8.0	And it is parents who help them to grow.
8.0	When they do something wrong, parents are ought to punish them.
8.0	On the contrary, when they do a good job, appropriate award which gives a positive sigal to children is also neccessary.
8.0	When children get the money, they know that their hard work is paying, and during the next semester, they will still focus on study.
5.0	Secondly, as children grow up, they have a stronger and stronger need for money.
8.0	As parents can not be with children all the time, it will be more convinient if children have some money.
8.0	For example, when students want to buy some stationery, it is a totally waste of time form them to go back home to get money and then go to the shop.
8.0	If they have money, they can go staightly to the shop and the saved time can be better used for their study.
0.0	What is more,children can be more independent learn how to distribute and manage their money.
0.0	Every children will grow to be an idependent adult who has to live by himself.
0.0	How to magage his money and make an appropriate budget is significant.
7.0	Therefore, when they are still
3.0	In my opinon, the idea which gives children just because they achieve good grade is not good.
12.0	Following are my reasons.
12.0	On one thing,giving  the school-age children money has a great possibility of making them not save the money, which will develop the conception of wasting money because the school-age children don't be aware of the money is earned by their parents' effort.
8.0	For example,the children spend all of the sallary when they grow up if they don't have the right conception of money.
8.0	On the other thing,as a school-age children, study is their obligation so they should study hard like their parents work hard.
8.0	Because having a good mark is not for their parents or just a little money,if they don't realise the point that they  study for themselves, they will not success in their career in the future.
8.0	What's more, the money may make the children think that they don't study for their dream or contributing to the community but for money.
8.0	Due to the parents giving their children money, their children may not have a great dream and a heart for developing the world.
6.0	In additon,in my opinon,the education to children should be encouraging children to do what they want to do rather than just ask them to get a good mark.
9.0	It is not money but the interest that is the best teacher to children so we should develop the interest of children from the native of them.
9.0	I think offer their school-age children money is wrong.
3.0	School grades plays a more and more important role in students' school days .
12.0	It would influence on students' entering higher education .
12.0	So , how to encorage children to get high grade become a classic topic of family education .
3.0	When I was in primery school , my grandparents always gave me some money as a reward for I got high mark .
10.0	Now many familys do the same thing .
3.0	Is this good for children?
6.0	Everyone keeps his opinions.
9.0	As for me , I think it's really a good way to encorage children .
9.0	First
12.0	As we all know ,mistakes can never be escaped from our life .
12.0	So it is so normal for a child to make some mistakes .
11.0	When they make some mistakes .
11.0	what we should do is tell our kids why they are wrong and what they should do the next time they meet the same situation.
8.0	Mistakes can be one of the most important treasure when the kids can learn from it .
8.0	So sometimes we call it chance to improve themselves.
8.0	We should let children make mistakes and just let them learn from their own mistakes.
8.0	For examples  ,when your son fall over himself ,we can help him up but we can also give him encouragement and let him stand up himself.
8.0	When i was a kid ,my father just let me stand up by myself.
8.0	"After i finished that ,he gave me a huge and told me,""my son ,when you grow up and leave the hometown for study ,you will face lots of challenges."
8.0	"At that time ,you have to deal with that all by yourself"" So ,even after 10 years ,i can still face the difficulties with a brave and strong heart and solve the problems ,with my parents not by my side."
6.0	However it dosen't mean that making mistakes is benificial to the kids with even no harm.
8.0	There is no doubt that making mistakes and facing that will all let the children under great pressure.
8.0	Even the pressure will destroy all thier confidences about the future .
8.0	So making mistakes can just be a double-aged sword for the children .
8.0	As i have mentioned ,great pressure and huge sense of gulit will push him down.
8.0	Next time , when he faces the same situation , he would be afraid of that and try to escape from .
1.0	So we should let children make mistakes and lead them in a corret way .
1.0	The expirence will be treasure in his own life and giive him stenghens.
3.0	As the development of the Internet, we can know the events that are happening around the world easily.
3.0	However, whether it is meaningful to know these international events is debatable.
3.0	Some people hold a point that it is useless to us, while others think that we should know these events to expand our vision.
11.0	However, I strongly believe that this behavior is really important considering the various topics it afford us and the increase it causes in our school work.
5.0	Firstly, we can have more affairs to talk with friends.
9.0	When we read the reports about those events, we know what are happening all over the world and in this way, we can have some very useful topics to communicate with others.
9.0	For example, when we don't have anything to talk with our friends, we can ask their perspectives toward one news, then we can continue our conversation and get rid of many embarrasment.
5.0	Secondly, it can improve our grades.
8.0	When we get these worldwide information, we have  have at least the basic knowledge of the national relationships.
8.0	Then we can find it easier to learn the subjects like history and politics.
8.0	Then, we can understand what the teacher taught in class entirely.
8.0	Also, we can recite these knowledge easier than usual.
8.0	As a result, we are able to spend more time on other subjects and certainly do better in our school work.
8.0	For exaple, when I start read these news, I find my history and politics grades increased.
1.0	All in all, knowing about events happening around the world is really beneficial.
1.0	Let's start checking these news now!
12.0	Nobody can avoid the fate of making mistakes, but the problem is whether parents should allow their kids making mistakes and learn from their own errors.
11.0	My perspective is yes.
4.0	Most importantly, when they teenagers make some errors when they are young, they will be less likely react them when they get older.
8.0	It's easy for kids to learn but it's difficult for kids make their ways without making mistakes.
8.0	Failure is the mother of success.
8.0	Failure will gives them deep impression, so when the next time they meet the same preblem, mistakes will teach children how to avoid making mistakes successfully.
8.0	For instance, if a kid pour a cup of water on floor for first time, he may just stand there and watching,but if next time if he do the same, he will pick up a tissue to clean the flloor.
8.0	Making mistakes is not terrible, if know the solusion to fix it, it will become one's fortune.
4.0	The second reason is that making errors helps people communicate with others.
8.0	When a person first meet a mistake, he or she may don't know how to solve it, they are more likely seek for help.
8.0	During the time seeking for help, they will learn how to communicate with elder or experinced people and learn how to behave themselves.
8.0	It's beneficial for them not only in their future career but also in their future life.
8.0	Because the skills of communicating are important in our career and in our daily life.
4.0	Last but not least, most families in china have only one child, the kids are mostly over spoiled.
8.0	Most of them cannot accept failure in their life, some even choose suicide when they meet obstacles.
8.0	Making mistakes is a good chance for the kids.
8.0	That will help them become more resilient, more brave and have a stronger mind.
8.0	It's not easy to face own mistakes, but allow children make mistakes is helping them to be a better person.
0.0	In conclusion, there are many disagreements about allowing kids make errors, but I still side with the opinion that it  has a long-term effect on children.
0.0	Maybe some people just see the negative influece caused by allowing kids make errors, but the advantage may emerge many years later.
0.0	The long-term harvest will surprise parents if they allow their children to make mistakes not overwhelmed by the protection of their parents.
3.0	Have you ever considered yourself as a machine which is also able to repeat the same or similar work all the year round?
3.0	Do you know how tedious and long to turn the forest into jade when we have a limited life span?
11.0	Although there will be precious outcomes in the end when we persitst on doing the same thing, we will get bored and it takes too long and is too difficult for a person to make the ends meet, which means to get to the top will cost too much.
12.0	Thus, it is significant to get ourselves involved in various works a day.
5.0	Doing different types of tasks allows us to get more inspirations.
8.0	If a person keeps on doing the same thing, it will narrow his  horizon and it will become difficult for one to make a progress.
8.0	For example, when I was preparing my exam, I always thought of doing the exercise, finding out my problems, and asking somebody who knew the answer.
8.0	I finished one task after another.
8.0	I realized that I did not make any progress according to the final score.
8.0	"Until one day, I was bored by the constant study, I began to play computer games called ""The King's Glory"" in the whole afternoon,it occurred to me that the logical pattern I used in the game to defeat the enemy can also be used in the oral task in the exam."
8.0	Then, I changed my strategy, I just did one part of an excercise in the morning and do some other tasks like watching a movie or a recorded concert on the computer in the afternoon.
8.0	I finally made a progress in the exam.
5.0	Moreover, various kinds of work may make us doing our work more efficiently.
8.0	A lot of works done at the same time can improve our ablitilies in deaing with all kinds of tasks at one time.
8.0	Our work will be more proficient and pleasing to our boss.
8.0	So we have a promotion in our job and a good develop
2.0	As a result, I prefer to do different tasks during a day.
3.0	Public transportation ,as one of the fundamental construction, put convinience to citizens.
3.0	A great may people suggest that government should spend money on improvement of transportation.
3.0	With the progress of internet techonology,internet access is playing an more important role all cross the world.
3.0	As far as I am concerned,governments spending money on improving internet access is of great significance.
11.0	There is couple of reasons that support my viewpoint.
5.0	Firstly,improvement on internet access make online education possible.
8.0	There are children in rural place who are not able to afford getting further education in university due to the high cost in the urban city.
8.0	With the access of internet,they can take courses at home.
8.0	For example,my friend quit school and returned to rural place planting crops for the poor financial situation of her family,being depressed for not recieving university education.
8.0	Thanks to the internet,she took an accounting course on a online university which helps her get a new job in the city as an accountant.
5.0	Secondly,the access to internet makes daily work routine easier.
9.0	Datas can be transmitted quickly and safe through the internet.
9.0	In case of an industrial company which used to record datas of products and raw materials on papers,if one of those papers is missing,get the data back could b
11.0	As the development of the society,people are more willing to help others though the man you don't know him.
12.0	Nowadays,the human are more happy than before, There is fewer uncomfortable things happened.
11.0	So people today are more willing to help the struggling people even the strangers.
11.0	So i agree with the statement.
5.0	People are more optimistic and fortunate ,the human hapiness index is improving.
8.0	First ,helping others are supposed to be deserved things,when somebody are in troubles.
8.0	For example,there is a poor old guy near my shcool gate,everytime he sit there and play the music instrument,some students from my shcool will send him 1yuan or 2 yuan and so on.
8.0	This action reflects that many people are kind-hearts.
8.0	Each time i passed him, i always give him some cash to help him.
5.0	Although the society always hapen some bad things,we can still see some justice man,they don't afraid of the rumor,their hearts are bright and clear,they do some right things that others can't do.
10.0	The society needs this kind of people ,they help others though end up there lives.
1.0	Last,life still moves on,society  still change.
1.0	JHowever ,the only thing will not change is the justice heart of some people.
3.0	At present, a controverial topic has aroused a heated debate among the students:is it more important to remain happy and optimistic when you fail than succeed?
3.0	Answers vary from one to another.
3.0	Some people claim that success is of critical importance.
11.0	However, contrary to their views comes my own perspective that keeping positive when we encounter failure is the most important.
11.0	My viewpoint is based on the following reasons.
5.0	First, remaining optimistic is conducive to adjustment to people's mood and atitude, which could help them quickly go through the failure.
8.0	To be more specific, when people fail to do something, keeping a positive mind will inspire them to light up their enthusiasm again and then restart to chase the goal.
8.0	However, it people couldn't get over this obstacle but were immersed in the failure in a persimistic mood, how could they look ahead and move on?
8.0	In this case, it will be too hard for them to be successful in the future.
8.0	For example, my uncle suffered a huge financial loss approximately about one billion dollars in his Internet company.
8.0	But he didn't choose to hault or escape.
8.0	Instead, he handled all these issues with a positive mind since he still believed his business could revive again.
8.0	And finally, by his calm style of dealing with business, one of his company's products made a hit.
5.0	Second, keeping positive is also of great benefit to health especially when people are much more stressful such as encountering the failure.
8.0	Specifically, when people suffer the failure, they always feel hurt or stressful for they are more likely to think they waste a second precious opportunity to succeed and fear that they could not get over the difficulty any more and then something bad will happen to their body such as headache, insomnia and even some cardiovasculars like heart diseases, However, if they choose to face the failure with a more optimistic way, the chance they are caught with diseases will be much less.
8.0	For example, my dad once suffer a setback in his job: he was fired by his boss.
8.0	He thought he could not support his family again and his self-esteem hurt as well.
8.0	During those days, he felt sick all the time and headache.
8.0	In this case, how could he resume to his business again?
8.0	it's impossible!
2.0	In conclusion, keeping positive and happy when we fail is of great importance for out future development.
3.0	Nowadays, more and more  people are leading a peaceful life.
3.0	In that case, we have ability to help other people in need.
11.0	Even thought this is true, I don’t think there are more people are willing to help the struggling stangers.
12.0	Here, I'll tell you the reason why I am disagreed.
6.0	First, most of us afraid of being cheated by the strangers.
8.0	The best example is the chearters in some railway station or subway station.
8.0	These strenger pretend to be very poor or in-need.
8.0	They tell people they are on the way home but lost their travel fees.
8.0	Thus the cheaters can get the sympathy from the warm-hearted people.
8.0	This is commen in most countries.
8.0	However, the method has been known to almost everybody.
8.0	So when one meet this situation, they will chose to ignore instead of helping.
0.0	On the other hand, people prefer to help the person who can reward them.
0.0	When one help othersthey may not get any reward.
0.0	After all, not all of us are generous.
0.0	Most of the time, we should pay for the help.
9.0	Once I heard a news about one old woman was crashed by a car, but no one called th ambulance because of the payment.
9.0	In the end, the women died.
7.0	No one payed, and no one
3.0	With the unprecendented development of the times, our pace of life is so fast.
11.0	Some people believe even though we are busy, we can do every thing perfectly.
11.0	As far as I concerned we do not have enough time to do every thing well.
11.0	This can be proved by following reasons.
5.0	Firstly,there are somethings for us which are just for fun.
8.0	Since the pressure of the society, we need some entertainment to relax.
8.0	If we focus too much on results, we can not expirence the joy of the process.
8.0	For example, my friend Tian  likes to play game on the weakend.
8.0	He paid a lot of attention on it , and he always got anger by the game since he lose the game.
8.0	He wants to play that game well.
8.0	However, in my opnion this is not neccesary, because I think he alreay forgot why he play the game, it is for relax on the weakend.
5.0	Secondly,I think the result does not influence my emotion if the things do not matter.
8.0	For example, when I was in the high school, all my friends like to play baseketball together, so do I.
8.0	We always play baseketball on the evening.
8.0	I did not have ability to play sport, but we also get along with each others.
7.0	Moreover, finally our goals are study, so I do not pay a lot of time to sport, intead of
11.0	I think it's a excellent idea which can improve the learning efficiency of the subjects they do not like to learn.
12.0	For all of us, learing is a long process, the benefits of learning can only be felt in a long time later.
12.0	And only the behavior of paying no gains few people will stick to it.
12.0	Learning is the case.
8.0	Unless people are aware of what they do for themselves.
8.0	But this is too difficult for children.
8.0	So we'd better give a little harvest as encouragement, otherwise they would hard to stick to it.
6.0	Few people are willing to adhere to do the things that can't see the short-term harvest.
8.0	For example, a employers told his employees that if your group could finish the long-term project, you would end up with a lot of money.
8.0	Then one year later, half of the group of people left, two years later, the group finally broke down.
8.0	People are tired and disappointed by the work that is paid with no harvested.
0.0	This theory can also be used in the school-age children.
0.0	with a little bit of money, we can inspire children's interest.
0.0	Why not do it?
3.0	Recently ,there is a hested discussion about whether the government should to protect the wild animais,some people believe that wild animals and wilderness areas do not need be protected,beacuse they do not importent enough to our life.
3.0	However,others hold a dissimilar viewpoint that animals are humen's friends ,we should protect them.
11.0	As for me,i agree with the latter one.
12.0	My reasons and examples are listed as follow.
6.0	One reason why i am in favor of my perspective is that animals are humen's friends,because some times they can help humen with there crops,which can help farmal get more crops.
8.0	A good example is that some insects eat crops leef,but frogs can eat insects,it can protect the crops avoid insects.
8.0	As the example suggests that frogs are good firend for farmals, Another relevant reason used to support my opinion is that wilderness areas are animal's home,good environment is very importan not only for animals,but also for our future generation.
8.0	For instans, becuse of the severe water pollution ,a lots of fish and  other biology are dead ,and the water can not be used for drinking.
2.0	In conclusion,theoretilly and pratically speaking,pretect animails and wilderness area is a rewarding choise.
10.0	Not only it can help farmal get more crops ,but also good for future generation.
12.0	Although nobody likes mistakes, no one is perfect and everyone makes mistake in his or her life.
12.0	Therefore, I greatly support that parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.
5.0	First of all, mistakes and errors can be the greatest lessons from which children can learn from.
8.0	For example, my daughter always forgets to put her homework in her schoolbag in the morning for my parents often help her.
8.0	One day, my parents were not at home and I did not do that for her.
8.0	Of course, she failed to remember to put her homework in her schoolbag and she was criticized by her teacher in calss.
8.0	When she got home.
8.0	she complained that I did not remind her of taking her homework.
8.0	I told her it was her own fault and it was her own responsibility to put the important things in her schoolbag.
8.0	She was criticized by teacher that day, but she learned a lesson.
8.0	Since then,, she always checks the important things she needs at school before she leaves home.
5.0	While making mistakes is a fact of life, parents's responses to mistakes made by their children really counts.
8.0	If the children just want to try their own thoughts but they fail, you have to encourage him or her, otherwise, children may become unwilling to try new things.
8.0	When I was young, I wanted to know whether someone lived in the radio because I could hear the voice.
8.0	So I disassembled the radio into parts.
8.0	My parents got mad and they did not allow me to take any electrical equipment apart.
8.0	Since then, I felt inconfident in some scientific courses especially when we had to do some experiments with hands.
8.0	Allowing children make mistakes will protect their creativity.
0.0	After all, parents can not protect their kids forever.
0.0	We have to allow children make mistakes to help them to become responsible and creative people.
0.0	Of course, we have to set certain boundaries for them___no addiction to drugs, no breaking the law and so on.
12.0	There is a heated discussion among the topic that young people today do not give enough time to helping their communities.
11.0	Different people hold different opinion on it.
11.0	Some people think young people nowadays have done their best to help the communities, while others think they have done little on it.
12.0	From my perspective, I think young people have spared a lot of time to help their communities.
5.0	First of all, many young people can be seen in many places which are designed to help people.
8.0	Nowadays, more and more young people devote themselves in helping people when they have time.
8.0	Many works are done by young people such as librarian and volunteers in the communities.
8.0	They can not only help their communities, but also improve their ability, making preparation for their future career.
5.0	Secondly, helping communities is one of the things to consider when applying for a job, thus more and more young people are willing to help their communities.
9.0	Companies want people who love helping others, so they check their employer during the interview whether they have helped their communities before.
9.0	Owing to this factor, young people tend to give more help in order to apply for their ideal company.
11.0	I agree the statement .
3.0	There are many factors to suppourt my view.
3.0	First, as all we know,when someone is feeling tired,the best way for he to relax is having a good rest .
11.0	So,it is so terribly ridiculous that when you are extremely tired,you choose to do physical exercise to relax yourself.
4.0	Secondly,watching a movie means you can have a good time with your family or your best friends.
8.0	In this way ,you might well feel more relaxed because of others' accompany.
8.0	well,reading a book indeed is a task for you alone.
8.0	But reading a good book is making friends with extraordinary people,which contribute to making yourself calm down.
8.0	While doing physical exercise almost is a team work .
8.0	You may be expected to be pay attention to your match.
8.0	This is not good for you to be calm.
4.0	Thirdly,doing physical exercise will strenghen your blood inpulse,which can make you become more excited and aggresive.
9.0	How can a excited people have a comfortable relax.
9.0	Compared with the exciting exercise,a quite and comfortable activity obviously is a good way to make yourself relaxing.
4.0	The last but not the least,the surroundings is of vital important.
8.0	when you want to enjoy watching a movie or reading a famous book , you should choose a comfortable sofa or a soft bed to give you a enjoyable surrounding.
8.0	A gentle music might as well be played.
8.0	Also somen delicious desert is needed.
8.0	what a unimaginable surrouding it is/ With such good conditions,it is impossible for you to fail to be relaxed.
8.0	But if you choose to do physical exercise,the sweat and the heat are what accompany you.
8.0	What is the worse,you will smell the uncomfortable smell like the fish going bad.
10.0	So ,it  is better
3.0	With the improvement of internet, people can easily know about news from all over the world.
3.0	So a controversial topic arouses a debate:  the event happening arroud the world are unlikely to the news occuring our daily life, whether it is important to know.
3.0	Some people are convinced that the event occuring surrounds is important for people to know.
3.0	But I hold the view that it is crucial for people to know the events happening arroud the world.
11.0	My view can be illustrated as follows.
5.0	First, knowing the events arroud the world will motivate people to develop themselves.
8.0	People can get know many famous sucessful enterpriners in the world which people will not see them personal  the whole life.
8.0	With the knowing, people may get the energy to study or work harder in order to achieve their goal.
8.0	If people just get know about the events arround themselves they will have limited understanding about sucess.
8.0	For example, Yonghao Luo has ever been an english teacher but now he is the CEO of Smatizan Science because he know about the father of the Apple, Steven Jobs.
8.0	Jobs's story inspires him to become a mobile phone desinger.
8.0	Without knowing the story, he can not get achievements today.
5.0	Second,people can prepare with furture during the events around the world.
8.0	The events occur in the world might happen arround people one day.
8.0	With the events have happend, people can prepare with the future.
8.0	However.
8.0	if people know less about world, they can prepare for future less.
8.0	For example, the economic crisis in 2008 happened because the US financial unsteady.
7.0	My father analyze the case and sell all his
3.0	Parents usually have high expectation on their children.
3.0	Some parents use money compliment their kids when they acheive a high score on exams.
3.0	It seems a good way to encourage students  to study harder.
11.0	However, the way parents offer theri school-age children money for each high grade they get in school may cause some serious problems.
11.0	Therefore, I am not agree with the statement.
4.0	First of all, students may cheat on exam to reach a high score in order to receive mony compliment.
8.0	Using money to luring students could not change student's attitudes to study.
8.0	Some students might worked hard but  only gained an average score without compliment.
8.0	At that situation, students may feel more passively on studying.
8.0	Therefore, they would cheat on exam next time which is a easier way to gain the compliment from parents.
8.0	For instance, one of my friend Emma, her parent promise give her 50 dollars if she could get a A on exams.
8.0	Although she prepared  hard for exam, she only got B on exam.
8.0	After that, Emma felt sad and started to hate study.
8.0	Offering money to students when they get a high grade ignored student's efforts and may let students cheat on exams.
4.0	Secondly, school-age students do not have the ability to manage money.
8.0	For some school-age students between 6-10 they even do not have comprehensive idea about money.
8.0	If they get money for reach high grade, they may spend thier money on a lot of video games which may distract their attention on further study.
8.0	Students are not mature enough for managing their money.
8.0	Earning money by getting high score on exams might let students spend too much money on entertainment.
4.0	Thirdly, this complimentary system may let students ignore the most important meaning of studying --- find your talent and what you want to do.
8.0	Students may study hard on subjects only drived by the money but forget to think about their own interest.
8.0	Student may accomplish assignment only because they want to get money.
8.0	The most important task for school-aged students is find what field they really interested in.
8.0	In that case, overly emphasize the power of money might let students cease to looking for what they really care about.
0.0	Conclusively, compliment school-aged children money when they get high grade in school might encourage them to cheat.
0.0	Also they may spend therir money unwisely.
0.0	Moreover, Students may ignore their interest in subjuec
11.0	Everyone usually make mistake, but make mistake is very important for everyone.
12.0	Different people have different idea.
12.0	Many people may thinks that disagree parents should let children make mistakes and let that learn from their own mistakes, maybe they want hope own children develop in happy envorment and children don't to face any troubles and mistake.
12.0	If children make a little of mistake, their parents must help for their children.
11.0	I usually believe that children should to make a little of mistakes and resolve misrtakes.
11.0	This can bring mant benifit for them and can help them become very strong.
5.0	Firstly, make mistake can let them learn from mistake and avoid make mistake again.
8.0	Because make mistake isn't terrible， on the contrary， is a good thing.
8.0	People can collect a lot of experience  from their mistake.
8.0	For example, when i was a baby, i usually made mistake.
8.0	So  my parents and teacher always critic me.
8.0	In end, I learned solve mistake .
8.0	so i think solve mistake is very important.
8.0	vety  very
5.0	secondly, taking resoinsibility and accepting result of own action occuring on account of doing some activity, hence, all vents have not positive outcome.
8.0	In fact, encountering errors are unavoidavble.
8.0	In such condition, learning responsibility toward false action is a worthwhile lesson.
8.0	In oter wor, children not only admit duty of their behavior, but also learn poinder before initiate every movement.
8.0	Based on my personal experience and according to my observation, individuals who not propersous in work space, they did not the real meaning of responsibility due to vicious educational system in past lif
1.0	In summar, parents should let children make mistake and let them their own mistake is very importan.
1.0	In fact lesson which arise from false action is a matter one never forget it.
3.0	Admittedly, public awareness regarding educational subjects and teacher's role have significantly increased over the last decades.
11.0	While some people have argued that instructor's opinion in different topics like political and social ones have to be concealed due to its aftermaths, others believe that it can benefit students in a number of ways.
11.0	To the best of my knowledge, the former view outweigh the latter one based on the following concerns.
4.0	There is a little room for doubt that the main function of any teaching institutions is to provide information in assigned courses.
8.0	In fact, teachers should concentrate on imparting those information accounts which have been known as school learning curruculum.
8.0	Hence, teacher's remarking about others subjects not only can be confusing but also it consumes student their valuable amout of time.
8.0	In fact, student less ability to realize deep connotation related to presidential election, as an example, might bored them, in turn, their time can be allocated to educational issue or interesting one.
4.0	Moreover, students, especially at younger age, are vulunerable while getting informed from different occurrences in their surrounding area.
8.0	In most occasions, they might harbor biased perception  toward a specific issue in politics or society and consequently, act impulsively bassed on their teacher's opinion.
8.0	Considering a situation, when a teacher declares his idea in politics openly, students harbor different positions toward teacher's m9indsets without any consideration but based on their relationship with their teachers.
8.0	Hence, controversial statements might mislead students and impairt teaching process thoroughtly.
4.0	On the other hand, there has been some occasions which freedom in teacher's speaking have its own redeeming features.
8.0	First, student's intervention in other materials convey democratic concept.
8.0	In fact, freedom dicussion might help them to realize that how to deal with adverse political or social setting .
8.0	In addition , it has played a pivotal role in broading their horizeon and as a result, both their mental ability and intellectual skill can be flourished.
8.0	Last but not least, student's self confidence will certainly boost if they experience a real situation with the onset of both positve and negative thoughts.
0.0	From what has been discussed, the demerits of teacher's opinion disclosure might adversely affect student's learning procss.
0.0	As it was mentioned, not only is it time-consuming and confusing but also might mislead them.
0.0	However, some free discussion can benefit students mental abilities.
10.0	XX
3.0	Nobody can grown up from a little boy to a mature adult, nobody can learn the truth in one night, nobody can obtain a good habit in one night.
3.0	Have a glimpse on the society, each successive merchan must have good abilty to manage their own money since they were children.
11.0	Therefore, I support the ideal that we should cultivate our ability to manage our money since we were young.
4.0	In the first place, a good habit is hard to obtain and a bad habit is hard to give up.
8.0	My brother Tom's instance successfully illustrates this point.
8.0	Tom, who grew up in a rich family, got lots of money every month;however, he always spend all of his money in the begin of the month, which makes he have to contituely request money from his mother.
8.0	When he walk into society, he alwas spends all of his money and then he have to ask his parents for help even he is a adult.
8.0	The reason he can not give up this bad habit is that he used to spend money in this way and it is hard to change.
8.0	Therefore, we should learn to reasonally attributes our money at a young age.
4.0	In the second place, that young children manage their own money in a young age can cultivate their self-discipine ability.
8.0	A generally-accepted fact is that all the children like toys.
8.0	However, some children will spend all of their money to buy the toys and on the contrast, some children will spend a small part of money to pay the toys and rest of money to buy the books and pencils.
8.0	Acording to this different kind of children, we can see that the children who buy the book and the pencils perspective what is important for them and they are more self-discipine.
8.0	This self-discipine ability is highly important in the future success as well as the future finance for one children.
8.0	Therefore, we shold let children learn how to right manage their money, which can help them stronger distinguish ability when they face choses in the future.
8.0	This ability can put the stepping stone toward the future for the children and help them financial responsible.
4.0	Even though some people think that the children are too small to manage their money.
9.0	Hoever, according to successfur merchants' examples like Musk, they help their young child stand a excellent consuming and manage ability.
9.0	We should definetally let children learn to manage their own money as young as well.
1.0	Above all, the ability to manage money is essential to obtain when a children at a young age.
1.0	That can help them become more self-discipine and successf
3.0	"Recently, because of several news cases, a classical debate topic has been brought up again: ""Are People today more willing to help the struggling strangers?"""
11.0	While some individuals consider this statement to be true, I strongly disagree with this statement because people today are more drawn to their own stuff, they are afraid to help others and they tend to work on their own rather than asking for help.
4.0	To begin with, people today are more drawn to their own work rather than helping others.
8.0	For instance, in the old times, human beings like to live in a big house contaning three or even four generations.
8.0	This provides them abundant space to communicate and share their problems with each other, which lead to some family member's caring personality so that they will be glad to help the struggling strangers.
8.0	In contrast, people today tend to live in small apartment rooms that only allow no more than 5 people to live in.
8.0	As time goes by, people will only care about their stuff and things related to their family rather than some random stranger's issue.
4.0	On the other hand, people today are afraid to help strangers because of the possible dangers.
8.0	We have seen too many cases in news or even in our real life that a caring, kind teenager tries to help an elderly who is laying in the middle of the road, but in the end situation turns out that the teenager becomes the one who pushes the elderly to the ground.
8.0	"Moreover, the teenager has to pay hundreds and thousands of fee because of the ""sin"" he has done."
8.0	How can anyone dare to help strangers after seeing cases like this!
4.0	Last but not least, More people tend to work on their own rather than asking for help.
8.0	As we all know, the modern world is a highly competetant world.
8.0	In order to survive, we need to use all our potentials and show no mercy to others.
8.0	In this world, hardly do anyone want to share their knowledges with others as it may end as a benefit to others but a bad thing to themselves.
8.0	This lead to more and more people work by their own rather than working in groups, which again contribute to people's indifference in modern society.
1.0	In conclusion, my opinion about people's indifference today is correct as people today focuses on their own work, they feel unsafe when helping others and they are in favor of working by themselves.
1.0	Nevertheless, I hope this situation can be alleviated in near future so the world can become a better place.
3.0	People nowadays, whether western or eastern, are increasingly concerned about their own success in the futhre.
11.0	However, when it comes to set a goal, public have their different perspective about whether people should follow their ambition or focus on achieving small plans.
12.0	Even though many elder people might insist that having a big dream might be more promising.
11.0	I am convinced of exactly the opposite that focusing on fulfilling realistic goals is clearly more reasonable than have only a big dream.
6.0	First and foremost, focusing on achiecing small plans would make people behave more corrcetly in the way to success.
8.0	This is primarily because having many short-term plans means having more deadlines which would make people work harder.
8.0	Under the pressure of due days, people would not have time to entertainment and would stick to achieve their own relistic goals.
8.0	It is, therefore, clear that people would behave more corrcetly and reasonablely in the progress to success.
8.0	On the contrary, if people have only a ambition, they would not have the stress from deadline because the achievement of that big dream is too far away.
8.0	Consequently, people might think they still have enough time to finish it in the future and put themselves in the entertainment.
8.0	For instance, when I was a freshman in university, I had a ambition to get full GPA in the first term.
8.0	However, because I had not any specific plans about how to study for that goal, I thought I could finish my study tasks in the future.
8.0	Therefore, I spent most of my term in attending social activites and having entertainment.
8.0	At the end of that term, I spent only two weeks in studying all the subjects before final week and I got my worst grades in the whole period of college which is far away from full GPA.
1.0	Furthermore, focusing on fulfilling realistic goals would make people more confident which is helpfull in future success.
1.0	This is partly pecause achieving large amount of small goals would let people feel the sense of achievement which is important in final dream.
8.0	Owing to that, people would firmly believe they can achieve their ambition and become more confident during this process.
8.0	In contrast, if people have only a big dream, they would not achieve many goals during the process and would not feel the sense of achievement as well.
8.0	Accordingly, they might be even less confident because the final dream is too far which could bocome a obstacle in future success.
8.0	For example, Peking University used to conducted a research in the field of economy.
7.0	Most of the merchants whose finance is higher than 30 billiens would set many goals during thier li
11.0	As far as I'm concerned, I'm in favor of the idea that for the reason that it benefits a lot for school-age children.
12.0	It is a way to motivate the school-agen children to work hard in school by giving one of the reasons why children should concerntrate on their school  work.
8.0	In reality, for a little child, he or she may not have the idea that how learning will influence someone but when told that an award will be given after getting a high grade, chances are that children will glad to learn instead of disgusting learning in school.
8.0	When I was a little boy, my parents gave me a promise that if My Math grade is higher than 90, they would give me 50 yuan.
8.0	After that, the thought to study hard was swirling in my heart contributing to my great progress in Math.
5.0	In addition, when offered money from parents, the first thing to arrange is how to spend the money offering an opportunity to curtivate a realization of spending money in a suitable way.
5.0	What's more, in the process of the growth of every children, there's no doubt that giving some awards is an common skill to educate children.
9.0	What parents shouled pay attention is that how much money should offer.
9.0	After measuring the balance between awards and cost.
2.0	As a result, in order to make children have a interest to learn, it will better to offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.
3.0	Nowadays, more and more parents discuss about awarding child obtaining high grades with money.
3.0	There comes a very common phomenon that some parents argue about it while the others in favor of it .
11.0	However, in my view, I agree with the former.
11.0	The reason are listed following.
4.0	Firstly, gaining high mark is a basic requirement for child.
10.0	Children are required to go to school and take class, A good grade just means that they do a great job in their study, In another words, it just prove that children have thier task done.
4.0	An vivid exmple is employee relation.
8.0	Picture these one day you told your boss that you did a good job to ask for bouns.
8.0	What is your boss's attitude?
8.0	Futhermore, giving money to high grade kids might contribute to money abuse.
8.0	Children are on their way to learn a lot of things , including how to spend money.
8.0	In that time, given awarding high grade children with money, in addition , he doesn't master how to spend money.
8.0	He is more likely to buy luxury goods which may lead to credit card abuse in future.
4.0	Today's college student can prove this.
9.0	Many of them live in these condition , when they go to college and have their own credit card.
9.0	They custom many unaffordable things, like laptop, cell phone, camera etc.
4.0	Last but not least, providing award to high mark kids is not a bad choice, as it can situmate children to try their best.
9.0	But there are many others that can outweight money.
9.0	For instance, to go to the park or watch a movie is an alterative which can help them release and relax from the heavy study load.
1.0	All in all, awarding high grade kids with money is absoutely awful decision which is not resonable and can lead to bad behaviors.
1.0	So I am aganist these method.
3.0	Nowadays, increasing attention has been set in the education of the school-age children in every family.
3.0	To enhance their grades, the society, especially the children's parents, come up with a series of method.
11.0	The most contoroversial one is that parents will offer children money.
12.0	I quite appreciate this idea.
4.0	It's a efficient pattern that has already been examined in many companies.
8.0	Employees all work hard to perform better so they can get a reward for their work.
8.0	Material incentive also make sense for schoolage children.
8.0	A cash reward can stimulate them in study.
8.0	For instant, my first smartphone is bought by the money I gained from my parents for the good grades I got in a final exam.
8.0	To get my phone, I spare no effaot to review my math, the subject I couldn't deal with before.
8.0	While there's not  a clear goal to achieve, the money parents offer can really be a vivid thing to catch.
4.0	What's more, why cant't parents offer children money for high frades while school offer students scholarships for excellent performance?
8.0	I hold the view that they are some parts in common.
8.0	The scholarships, however, is limited and hard for some students to get.
8.0	Maybe you make extreme progress in your study though you are still middle in the class, it's impossible for you to earn a scholarship just for the tops.
8.0	But parents can always give the children this award as a encouragement when they deserve it.
8.0	It is no more than money but a honor for the children.
8.0	Ialways fell proud of my phone and treasure it a cherish.
4.0	Also, children can learn to manage their money in a early age.
7.0	It's of great significance to gain the ability to deal with financial problems, The fast d
3.0	With the swift development of the Internet,it is,without doubt,for us to obtain all kinds of information through our computer,mobile phone,or ipad.
3.0	However,we are still able to meet with virus or negative contents on the Internet.
12.0	From my perspective,I believe that we the valuable information provided by Internet is overwheelming.
4.0	First,we can get exactly what we need within just a few minutes.
9.0	Nowadays,powerful and save search engine such as Baidu and Google can help us find the accurate information we're looking for because it can filtrate the information in less than 1 second.
9.0	In this way,we don't need to worry about the situation that we click into a wrong page.
4.0	Also,the well-developed network is conducive to our communicating with people all over the world.
9.0	With advanced social apps such as twiiter or facebook,we can easily talk to someone in a different country,by which we can learn different cultures,different knowledge,etc.
9.0	By doing this,it is easy and quick for us to obtain a wide range of knowledge.
4.0	Finally,despite we may meet with negative information,the save wirewalls can protect us from virus or trash websites.
7.0	In conclusion,it is the Internet that provides us with a lot of valuable information that we can trust in
3.0	Recently, there is a heated discussion about student should work together on projects.
3.0	Some people believe that students must work together, because that is more effectively than alone on projects.
3.0	However, others hold a dissimilar viwepoints that work alone is better than work together.
11.0	As for me, i agree with the latter one.
10.0	My reasons and example are listed as follows.
5.0	One reason why i am in favor of my opinion is that work alone more effectively is ture.
8.0	As i can see, not everyone is friendly talking to oher one.
8.0	So, most time, you have to talk with your teamates on other things,even argue with them on works, and as a team, that muat have a leader, if a team dosen't has a person to become the leader, they were in disorder.
8.0	All the plan can't carry out, even the team can't take any plans.
8.0	In addition, some projects are not to large, i mean the project only need one or two preson,more preson in the project will slow down the working speed.
8.0	Therefore, one person means only has the duty for herself, and don't need to spend time on communication  with other.
5.0	Another relevant reason used to support my opinion is that work alone take much benefits on one person.
8.0	For instance, one group has a common project with other group, the different between them is the number of the member.
8.0	If all of two groups have the same achievement on the project.
8.0	There has no adoubt, the second group  is better than first group, because one person has done the same achievement with other five preson.
8.0	Thereby, the one person group has the greastest advantages in any elejection for her own Curriculum Vitae.
2.0	In conclusion, theoretically and practically speaking, work alone can take more benfits than work together for students.
3.0	Nowadays, more and more people met difficulties because of the pressure from workplaces and social circumstances.
3.0	Recently, I saw a hot debate on the Internet about is it more improtant to relate people well or study hard at school?
3.0	To solve the problem, I do some researches on the Internet about it.
12.0	After serious considering.
11.0	I assume that it is more crucial to study hard at school better than relate people well.
12.0	Here are my reasons below to illustrate my point of view.
5.0	First of all, it is crucial for us to build basic knowledge before we are in career life which would make us to face difficulties easily.
8.0	I wanna to take the CEO of Apple, Tim Cook as an example to illustrate my opinion.
8.0	As an successful bussiness man, he gained huge reputation after Jobs' death.
8.0	He made Apple alive and cross through many management problems, but we all know that he is not a eloquent or creative man such as Steve.
8.0	he is just a normal manager to analysis the problems calmly.
8.0	Which made him so successful is because he got really good grades at school, he was one of the top students and play drums really well at campus.
8.0	He gain some basic knowledge before graduate.
8.0	So he can apply these knowledge to manage people well during his career.
8.0	From this perspective, we can see cleary that Cook is a hard working man who success in a future job.
5.0	Addtionally, hard working at school can bring us huge benefits because it is valuable experience for us to make though difficulties in our workplaces.
8.0	For instance, the high school students in China would face a examination to enter college at senior grade, they have to pay much attention on this because it decides the path for future jobs.
8.0	during these three years, they have to work really hard and face the presurre both from parents and classmates.
8.0	In this cruel competition, they will experience a lot and make through it finally.
8.0	this experience of hard working would bring them with valuable methods to be successful in future jobs.
0.0	In a nut shell, it is important for us to be hard working at school in order to be successful in future jobs.
0.0	the people who support that it is more improtant to relate other people well are reasonable mainly because it is a neccessary skill to cope with social relations.
0.0	However, it can't be constant because we need true knowledge and abilties to deal with problems in our job.
0.0	According to the passage, i support that it is crucial to be hard wo
12.0	With the development of society ,more and more parents are very focused on education and the grades that children get in school.
12.0	Therefore,parents will offer money to their children‘s good grade as a reward.
11.0	In my opinion,it's necessary for children to promote their mark,which is a way of encouraging.
11.0	My opinions are as follows.
5.0	On the one hand ,when children know they will get money after get a good mark,they will  study hard and efficiently.
8.0	Parents are willing to see their children become more talented.
8.0	On the other hand, children not only have opportunities to acquire knowledge,when they get the money,they have time to relax their habits or buy something they want.
8.0	It seems to strengthen family ties.
5.0	Here's an example ,following investigation,80% children were happy when they get high grade that parents gave them some money.
9.0	These students obtained exellent achievement.
9.0	To sum up, I support this view.
12.0	Some people assert that children should choose jobs that are different from their parents' jobs.
11.0	However, as far as I am concerned, it is better for children to choose jobs that are similar to their parents' jobs for the following reasons.
4.0	First and foremost, parents are the first teachers of children and they are the most influencial people throughout their descendents' lives.
8.0	So it is very likely that their descendents behave just like their parents.
8.0	To illustrate, both of my parents are teachers and they always tell me that I can be a teacher when I grow up.
8.0	And they provide a good education environment for me to learn and grow up.
8.0	Not surprisingly, I am a qualified English teacher and lead an enjoyable and satisfactory life.
4.0	Furthermore, parents are more mature and experienced and they can give us constructive and suggestive advice when it comes to choosing careers.
8.0	For example, when I graduated from Wuhan University and attended the career fairs, hoping to find a good job, I was really anxious and depressed because I was turned down by numerous companies.
8.0	Therefore, I turned to my father for some useful suggestions.
8.0	My father told me that do not find job blindly and I have to make some plans in order to stand out in the numerous interviewees.
8.0	He helped me clarify the confusing conditions and led me to be an English teacher finally.
8.0	Because my father was an experienced math teacher and he knew how to leave a good impression when I attended the interviews.
8.0	Thanks to my father, I got the offer ultimately.
4.0	What's more, when we choose the similar jobs to our parents', we can conquer the difficulties and obstacles in our careers easily.
8.0	It is no doubt that our parents will give us effective and efficient instructions if we do not know the professional problems and questions in our work.
8.0	To illustate, if your father is a banker, he will definitely help you a lot in your financial career and tell you the necessary skills in coping with the financial problems.
8.0	And a carpenter's son may well know how to make a good piece of furniture out of a piece of wood.
1.0	In a nutshell, I strongly recommend children to choose jobs that are similar to their parents' jobs for the above reasons.
1.0	Children tend to imitate their parents, our parents are more experienced and we are inclined to conquer difficulties in the familiar field.
3.0	Nowadays, people are faced with different kinds of pressure, thus making relaxing significant.
3.0	Some people would like to watch a movie or read a book to get a relax, while others prefer to do sports.
3.0	As for me, I would like to play sports when I felt tired.
12.0	For doing sports can make me meet different friends and at the same time, make me healthier and stronger.
4.0	Different from watching or reading alone, doing sports can give access to different people.
8.0	compared with lying on your bed or sofa and watch a movie, playing sports forces you to go out and meet others.
8.0	And this can boarden your social circle and make you feel less lonely.
8.0	I met one of my best friends while I was playing basketball one day.
8.0	We played together and became good frieds.
8.0	We are still contacting with each other now and if I chose to stay at home everyday, I wouldn't have met so nice a girl.
4.0	It's also good for your health if you relax yourself by doing physical exercise.
8.0	Once you get out and feel the gentle wind, the fresh air and beautiful scenes, you will feel joyful.
8.0	After running or playing some ball games, you may sweat a lot, thus making wasted materia in your body get out.
8.0	Your musules can also be trained during your exercise and you can feel much more energetic.
8.0	My father even found that he could sleep better after running for an hour to relax, thus making him less likely to get tired when he is working.
4.0	Of course if you stay at home and read or watch movies alone, you can get a mental satisfaction, but it will make you lazier and less likely to exercise.
9.0	what's more, you will be addicted to the book or the movie and this will have a negative influence on your following work.
9.0	"And if you choose a book that is not so relaxing, you will feel much moer tired after your ""relaxation""."
2.0	There is no doubt that relaxing yourself at home by reading a book or watching a movie is a good way, but doing ex
3.0	With the importance of the high grade for students, some parents started to award their children money because of their high marks.
3.0	Some people argue that this is a good idea, while others stand at the opposite side.
11.0	Personally, I think the idea is reasonable.
5.0	First of all, offering children money for their high marks could help them to discover their interests of studying.
8.0	At first children may started to study hard for the money,but during the procedure of making efforts, they may get the confidence from their progress of the grades or the phrase from their teachers and parents.
8.0	Keeping this situation for a long time, they may get the interests from their exploring of each subjects.
8.0	As a result, they may find their most favorite major or subjects.
5.0	In addition, offering money to children could also help them to form a good habit weather in working or studying.
8.0	During the process of recieving money, children may get to understand the sense of working for reward.
8.0	They will have the motivation to study because of the benefit they get after having a good result.
8.0	As a consequence, they will have a habit of studying or working very hard, therefore, it is beneficial because they will form a good habit after they see the absoluter reward because of their hardworking.
0.0	Admittedly, some may argue that giving them money for their grades may let them to get some illegal goods or do some wrong things.
0.0	Anyway, this problem could be solved by helping them to manage their own money.
0.0	Namely, parents could restrict the products they want to buy and have a plan of how much money they could spend for each day, As a result, the problem could be solved.
0.0	Therefore, I am still convinced that offering children money is beneficialto them,
12.0	People are busy with their work now, so they will use many ways to relax themselves during the holiday, such doing sports, watching movies and going shorping.
12.0	Some people choose to travle and most of them believe it is best to have a guide on the trip.
12.0	However, I don't think it is the best way to travle with a tour guide, becaue join the tourist group is not free.
6.0	First of all, raveling with a group of people, many operations will be limited.
8.0	Everyone have to listen to the tour guide for all the arrangments.
8.0	The tour guide will set the time of getting up, even set the time to arrive at place we are going to visit, so only a little part of the time is free for ourselves.
8.0	But if people don't travel with a group  For example, I used to travle with a group, but last summer vvacation I went traveling with my good friend.
8.0	We do not have to get up early
12.0	In my option, I support the parents to let children make mistakes and then learn from it.
12.0	Here are my views.
12.0	Nowadays, as the economy of the world developing rapidly, more and more attention are put on the children education.
12.0	All the parents are not willing to let their students lead a bad life in the future, so some parents think make some mistakes in the childhood won't cost a lot, and their children can learn a lot from it.
12.0	I completely agree it.
8.0	Firstly, if the children make mistakes in little ages, most of us won't put it on our heart, in other words, he still have chances to change themselves.
8.0	Take  a man who is the son of a famous star as a example, his name is Li TianYi.
8.0	Li lived a very happy life in his childhood, his parents never had blamed him, and he never reflectd himself every time he made mistakes.
8.0	But in his 18 years old, he was caught by the cops because he made a crime, his father was very sad.
8.0	So if we can reflect ourselfs from every mistakes we have made, we won't make a bigger mistake in the future.
6.0	Secondly, a peaceful life is not good for a child, said by many famous figures, if they made some mistakes in their childhood, they could have such a experience that they would understand life is not always sweet.
10.0	Moreover, they will have a preparation in their mood once they meet difficulties.
2.0	Last but not least, if they learned from themselves, they will have the ablity to reflect, which is necessary for them in their future life.
7.0	In short, this thought is right, but we should make sure that our children can lead a happy and colorful life, it is more important,
3.0	Nowadays, the influence of the opinions from celebrities is highly debatable.
3.0	And some peoples reckon that such opinions are more important to older people than to younger people.
12.0	Personally, I regarde this assertion as arbitary and uniliteral.
12.0	I strongly suppor the opposite view.
12.0	Here are the reasons and examples to support my standpoint.
5.0	Firstly, the effect of celebrities will be maximized when it comes to the young people.
8.0	In other words, the younger a person is, the more he or she is sensitive to the celebrities, including thier views.
8.0	Many young peope tend to hesitate when they meet with various choices.
8.0	At this point, they may be likely to be influenced by the opinion of celebrities since social figures are usually the symble of success and the young are eager for success.
8.0	However, as for those people with older ages they are less likely tobe influenced then the celebrities because they have already formed their own thinking pattern and thus they are less likely to be influenced by others, including social figures.
8.0	For example, when thepresident encourage males to participate in the army during the Civil War, many young people did so because they admire the present and thus be inspired.
8.0	But the older people has their own view towards the war and are not inspired by the president's speech.
5.0	Secondly, after listening to the viewpoint from celebrities, young prople have more chance to carry out such opinions.
8.0	Nevertheless, the elder preople, with less opportunities compared with the young, are less likely to take those opinions in to practice.
8.0	Take China as an example.
8.0	Presiodent Xi Jinpin ha always encouraged people to seek feature in the western of China no matter what their age groups are.
8.0	But enventuallyy, lots of young people flooded in western China.
8.0	People with older ages didn't tend to listen to this advice bacause they have little chance to migrate like the young did.
10.0	Here are the reasons
3.0	The distance to the people we care about is always an important element for the connection between us.
3.0	There is a heat discussion about whether being far away has a positive effect or not.
12.0	On the other hand, being far away can leave more space for the person you care which can show your respect for him or her.
12.0	On the other hand, being far away may has some disadvantageous.
5.0	Firstly, if you spend more time having long distance between the one you care about, the friendship may die down gradually.
8.0	It is easy to know that if you do not stay with him often, you can not get to know what happened on him recently and what kind of state of mind he is.
8.0	Because the person who near him can know the what things he is going through and can has a face to face conversation more often, but you can not.
8.0	In that way, he definitely will have more new friends and there will be also less talks with you.
8.0	Gradually, once less contact, less communication, the less the topics you can share, as a result, this one you care about just was your friend.
5.0	Moreover, this may cause misunderstandings.
8.0	Except friends, we also care about our family.
8.0	The long distance between you and your parents will really damage your relationship.
8.0	To illustrate, there was a period that i did not talk to my dad and always stayed away from him because i did not know what i can say to him for i was so afraid of him.
8.0	We kept this state for two months.
8.0	And one evening, my mother talked to me that my dad was very confused why i did not even talk to him and he though of thousands of possibilities.
8.0	After that, i knew i should tell him what i felt for him.
8.0	He was in a big relief when i finally had a conversation with him.
8.0	And we are very good now.
8.0	He always supports me and help me solve my problems.
8.0	I am very glad that i did not stay away from my father because i can feel his warmth when i stay with him.
2.0	In the end, we should always stay close to the person we care about for it can strengthen our relationships.
12.0	Personally speaking,if my friend wants to get help in study,I would definitely advise him to ask tutor for a favour.
11.0	And my reasons are as follows.
4.0	To begin with, a tutor is clearly much more professional than me in the teaching field.
8.0	Though I am good at study, I just know how to get information from outside ,rather than output them.
8.0	However, tutors are different and are skilled in teaching.
8.0	For example, toward to the same mathematical question, a tutor can not only tell students the solution to this question,but also the expansion of this question, so that students can figure out the similar question when they meet them next time.
8.0	But when it comes to me, I may even have difficulty in working the question.
4.0	Second of all, finding a tutor for help means improvement in communication.
8.0	Since my friend has to speak with a stranger, he needs to learn how to express his doubts distinctly.
8.0	Taking the famous Chinese scientist Qian Xueseng for a instance.
8.0	When he was in his childhood, he learned things so quickly that he had so much doubts that can not  solved by himself.
8.0	However, since he was only burried in studying, he did not know how to turn to others.
8.0	Fortunately, his father brought him a teacher soon.
8.0	And thanks to that, he could not only question freely,but also got the opportunity to communicate with others.
8.0	And it laid the foundation for his later significant remarks at an academic conference as well.
8.0	Had Qian's father not brought him a teacher, he would not have had the skills in talking academically.
4.0	Last but not least, helping my friends may result in decline in my own grade.
9.0	Because I have to use the limited time both to study and teach, I won't have the same time as before to do papers and review.
9.0	"And the old saying said that ""learining is like rowing against the current"",so it may put me on the line of not being the best series."
2.0	All in all, the above three are my reasons for employing an adviser.
3.0	Recently , there is a heated discussion about  the bike sharing scheme in Wuhan.
3.0	Some people believe that bike sharing scheme is really dangerous ,because anyone could use it such as mobike or ofo, However  other hold a dissimilar viewpoint that the bike sharing scheme could make our life more confortable.
3.0	As for me , I agree with both of the point.
3.0	Because I think the  bike sharing scheme both have the advantages and dis advantages.
12.0	My reasons and examples are listed as follow.
6.0	Firstly the advantages of the bike sharing scheme is that it make our life more comfortable let the traspotaion easier.
8.0	A good example of this is that the way to my school is  really slowly , if I want to get to school on time , I must get up at 6.
8.0	that make crazy and influnce the whole day study.
8.0	But I could get to school on time without get up at 6 since the bike sharing scheme in wuhan.
8.0	I could just ride bike to schhool .
8.0	And in the other side , I could exercise by riding bike every day.
8.0	You know nowadys  people do not have enough time to do exercise and  keep their body fit.
8.0	So this is a good way for people to relax and exercise.
2.0	Then ,the disadvantage of the bike sharing scheme is that it make the road more dangers.
8.0	Because we use smart phone to unlock the bicycle, Nobody know  who you really are .
8.0	For example , a boy which is under 12 years old use his father's phone to unlock the bike and ride in the road .
8.0	During that time ,the boy could not get a good grip on the traffic and is likely to cause an acciden.
8.0	at this time is too late to regret..
7.0	What 's more their are many palce that are too much mobike to  despot on one place that make the traffic jam , tha really influnce the
3.0	It is a generally accepted fact that a good education is the cornerstone toward children's future achievement.
3.0	However, as the advance of cell phone, online games, and social networking Web site, educating children become increasingly harsh nowadays.
4.0	In the first place, there are lots of distraction including computer games undermine the children's occupation on study.
8.0	For instance, my little brother is a big fan of computer games, which makes my parents and his teacher highly confused.
8.0	He always thinks about the imagine of computer games and how to play the games well in the classes and even when he go to the bed.
8.0	Endulging in computer games makes him always have a bad grade and have a bad eyesight.
8.0	Eventhough my parents and teachers have been tried a myriad of means including removing the internet in the home, all of these ways not go a long way.
8.0	This phenomenon was impossible in the past resulting ino the fact that people that time can have not computer this kind of thing, which enable them study efficiently with a succinct emotion.
8.0	Therefore, which the computer become increasingly common in the society, educating children become a harder tast for people.
4.0	In the second place, using internet on cell phone and social networking Web site will expand children's outlood, which enable children have their own opinion.
8.0	Therefore, it is more difficult to teach children than the past.
8.0	In the past when there was no internet, children only know some daily events and basic knowledge; therefore, they will just consider these kinds of things and teachers can just teach some knowledge to the children.
8.0	However, when cell phone and social networking Web site come into our life, children can learn more different, modern ideals.
8.0	Therefore, they will have their own political perspection and thoughts of news.
8.0	This time, to be the educator of children, we need obtain more versatile expertise including the current political knowledge and social knowledge, which equipe us ability to solve the children's questions.
8.0	Therefore, it is challenging for educators nowadays.
4.0	Eventhough some people think that celll phone, online games and social networking Web site can reduce the difficulty to educate children resulting into the fact that they can use these device to do lots of recreatino without the help of educators.
8.0	Nevertheless, I totally disagree with this point.
8.0	It is known to all that increasing number of bad people use internet and social Web site to anounce negative information and decieve children.
8.0	Therefore, these information period bring more danger for the children.
8.0	Therefore, educators have more tasks to teach children how to protect themselves.
2.0	To sum up, it is more challending to educate chidren nowadays than the past.
11.0	I agree about this idea.
8.0	Everyone had childhood,when they are child,they know nothing about this world, so they should learn or know more information about this world,but who will they learn from and how to learn, they should learn from someone who bring them to this world ,so they should learn from their parents ,parents can tell them how to do or how to think.
8.0	They maybe know the theroy but they don't know how to do.
8.0	Everything need practice,although you know the theroy or the information,you may also don't know how to do,so you should practice ,but how to practice ,you should do more thing that you didn't do,in this progress you maybe not be good all the time,most of time,you will in trouble or you will get in a crossroad,it is really common,so parents should forgive their action and their thinking,some wise parents will let their children get in a trouble or make mistake.
8.0	so their child will learn more and get more experience,let them think why i can't do this well,sometimes they will learn something from this thing.
8.0	I know it may boring for you to know this,so i can give you a example,when i was six years old,i always do something bad,because l was little and i know nothing,my parents often tell me their story,they want me learn something from it,but i didn't  them ,and always laugh at them,i think their story is stupid,so they think they should let me to do,it will be useful .
8.0	Of course i made a lot of mistake,i like write my story on the bed,when l lay on my bed,i think it is soft,it will helps me to thinking math problem,when my mom says it is not good for your health and your habit will develop badly,i refused to listen to her and do my home work on the bed,few weeks later,when i stand up or sit down, my neck will feel harmful and if i stand for a long time i will feel tired.
8.0	i realize what my mom said.
8.0	And after that i just sit on my chair to do homework   so this is my example,according to this example, i agree this opion,i think it can tell you something about me,and let you know why i agree about this opion.
3.0	with the development of economy and technology, it provides more and more opportunities for people to enjoy the life.
12.0	work and study are important for a people's life but relax it's also important for people's life.
12.0	in the modern society people crate a lots of way of entertainment like vidio games, sport, and book.
12.0	today i want to talk  about the best way to relax.
8.0	esh the story.
8.0	after you finish the story you will getting excited you will losing sleep after you finish your movie or your book.
8.0	that is why i choose doing physical exercise for my relax.
10.0	at the end of my essay i want to say you will have your own way to relax you dont need to imitation other people's way to relax.
3.0	In the contemporary world, education play a important role in social development.
3.0	Now have a discuss about government should spend money on the education of very young children or  on universities.
3.0	Some people think the youny children are the future of the world, so children's education need more money.
11.0	And some people think that university's education is more useful than children's education.
11.0	In my opinion, both of them are all improtant.
6.0	Firstly, good primary education will improve children's brain growth  then they will have chance to establish future world.
8.0	Many sciences have proved that when a child whose age from five to then years old have a successful education and stimulate in him or her brain, their memory, creativity and understanding ability will be better than other children.
8.0	For example, learning langarage, children are more easier that aldout, and undoubled that children imagenation are more better that people.
8.0	As a result,  education have that ability to deveplop children's protention by training their brain.
1.0	Secondly, university's education is useful now.
1.0	Universities students means they will face to find a job, so they absolutaly need to learn some useful skills to prepare for their future,  and  university's education provide the plateform.
10.0	But many universities all have a problem that then they don't have enough money to buy equipments which are use for teaching and experience.
3.0	Have you ever draw in the computer by using many fantastic functions?
3.0	Have you been spirited by a model of the future airplane in the technology museum?
3.0	The answer must be Yes.
3.0	My sister and me always draw by using computer and we can built three-dimention pictures.
3.0	And once we have seen a plane model in the technology museum.
3.0	We are attracted by it and built our own model when we went back home.
11.0	Therby, I think technology help children to be more creative than before.
10.0	There are two more specific reasons why I think in this way.
5.0	Initially, I think the advanced function such as three-dimention can help us create more cubic objects that is difficult for us to draw by hands.
8.0	For instance, my sister and I use the three-dimention function in computer; we draw a flower in different facets and color it with thousands of colors to make it more realistic.
8.0	We try every funtion to built and color the diverse flowers that we create.
8.0	Many weeks later, our parents think that our pictures become more and more realistic and extraordinary.
8.0	However, in the past, we can just drew pictures on the paper and create the characters in one facet and color it with twenty four colors.
8.0	It seems not novel or beautiful.
5.0	Moreover, I think the cutting-edge models in technology museum can provide more details that  spirite us to built our own entique model.
8.0	For example, after watched the advaced airplane model on the green.
8.0	We went back and imagined our own planes.
8.0	We make the arms of the palne birds-like and add the mouth on it.
8.0	Though the plane is not practical, but we have meditate and add own ideas.
8.0	That technological model make us more creative.
1.0	Even though the technological machine such as computer do make many people dulged in playing games and make them awakward, I still think if parents make schedules for their children and control them more, we can avoide that situation.
1.0	Taking account of all the factors mentioned above, we may safely arrive the conclusion that technology can make children more creative.
3.0	With the fast-paced development of society, whether to help struggling strangers arouse people's attention.
11.0	someone might think that people become more compassionate and sympathy than people in the past.
12.0	However, I hold the opposite view that today's people are less willing to help irrelevant people.
6.0	first of all, more and more people are having a busy life in the metropolis.
8.0	Nowadays, they have less time to communicate or contact with others, instead, they spend time working or studying.
8.0	So as a present people, we hardly to visit friends or make a new friend.
8.0	Obviously, we always hide us in limited place which causes people are less willing to contact with others.
8.0	Comparatively speaking, in the past, people have a stronger bond with each other.
8.0	Take my grandparents as an example, they are willing to help the passerby who is hungered or thirst by providing a delicious meal or a glass of water.
8.0	They treat the stranger like an old friend, they can easily chat or share jokes with them.
8.0	Thus, the life pressure compels people becoming less caring about surroundings.
10.0	In addition, only the familiar
3.0	Currently, there a new debate among citizens: what should government do to attract more tourists visit their city?
3.0	Some people think we should hire more polic, which can improve the safety.
3.0	Nevertheless, as far as I am concerned, improving the appearance by secorate the old buildings and street better choice.
12.0	The reason are listed in the folloeing.
5.0	To begin with, improving the apprence will stimulate visitors interest.
8.0	To be more specific, if we add some entertainment in the old street, there are some different activities from before so that more people wants to try them.
8.0	Their curiosity lead to more interest about this street.
8.0	Therefore, more people are ailling to travel in out city.
8.0	For instance, I lived in a old street when I was a boy.
8.0	But no one would like to come because there is nothing different from street in other city.
8.0	After gonverment support us 500 million dollors to build some new shops and entertainments, roller causter, parks, spring in lake apper in our street.
8.0	Thus, more prople come to our city just to see the change of our street even some of them having come before.
8.0	In conclution, improve the apperance can rouse visitor interest and attract more vistors.
5.0	Furthermore, decorating the old buildings can let the visiter feel the magic of history.
8.0	This is because some old thing that are mearly ectinct can be put into the old bulidings.
8.0	With the charaters of the old buildings, these construction tell people the history of this town.
8.0	Therefore, travelers can find the change between past now and feel the magic of time, which is attractive to many visitors.
8.0	For example, when rebuilding our street, the government bought some old houses.
8.0	After the subject has been down, there are some old things in these old house, such as sewing machine that was used in Qing danasty.
8.0	Many parents brought their children there to see the old machine and tell them the fast development of the manufactory.
8.0	It is not for us to find out that decorating the old bulidings has the ability to attract tourists by seeing the old things.
2.0	In conclusion, the governme t really should improve the apperance t
3.0	According to a famous german book, The Theory of War, the leadership is a gift which determines one's position.
3.0	The writer of this book is the millitary teacher of the king of Germany in the 17th century, and he spent most his life on the battlefield.
11.0	So I agree with this statement that leadership comes from one's talent rather than the effort.
5.0	On the one hand, the kids can display their leadership when they are very young.
8.0	It is the talented leadership that drives a kid to command otehrs to finish a task naturally in a teamwork job.
8.0	And it is very common that some children in a group have a quiet strong tendency to lead the whole group and serve as a leader in the cooperation even when they are still in the school.
8.0	And I will ultinize a story as an example.
8.0	When the chairman Mao in China was a adolescent in middle school, he organized his classmates to defend the Japanese army's attack to their school successfully.
8.0	During the battle, the soldiers of Mao were not equipped with any guns or other weapons.
8.0	And what they did iwas just taking advantage of the local distrubing of the buildings to trap and mislead the Japaneses under the lead of Mao.
8.0	So it can be firmly beliueved that the young can display their natural leadership at the early time.
5.0	On the other hand, the adult cannot learn any essential lead skills if he or she is not a gifted one.
10.0	The talented leadership will help an adult to get an good occupation as a leader while the adult withou talent will feel afraid when he or she is faced with the public.
0.0	There is not doubt that people can learn some skills about leadership by taking leadership courses in the career school.
0.0	Nevertheless, the student cannot be a good leader after finishing the classes if he or she does not have any gift.
0.0	Especially the student is extremely shy.
11.0	I do agree the statement that people today are more willing to help the struggling strangers.
11.0	There are many reasons contributing to it.
11.0	First, with the development of our life, more and more people have enough power to help others , because most people have thier own jobs, almost everyone can live without cold and straving.
11.0	Second, when someone have enough money to live, they will be more kindness than before.
8.0	Third, most people who get helps from strangers will be gratitude to the society, which results that more and more people are willing to help struglling strangers.
8.0	Last but not least, a little money may means a dinner for some struggling people , but it may means nothing for those priviligers .
8.0	So ,when we can hepl others with a little pay ,why not do it ?
6.0	Howerver, there are still few people who are not  willing to help struggling strangers.
8.0	For one thing ,they may don't have enough power to do what they like to do ,which means that if they help others ,they may be poor .
8.0	For another thing ,someone who have enough power but still do not help others may be kindless , they never give other help ,so with time goes, anyone others are also not willing to help them which means people who don't help others can't get help from others when they are in trouble.
8.0	Anyone don't want to become those peoplr ,so more and more people are willing to help the struggling strangers.
2.0	As we all konw ,no one is always kindless,every one can be well ,our society is also getting  better ,so ,when you are in trouble ,don't worry!
3.0	With the improvement of people's living standard, the topic of tourism has aroused a heated debate.
3.0	When it comes to how to develop tourism, the opinions differ from person to person.
3.0	Some claim that hiring more police to guarantee the safety of the city should be taken precedence.
3.0	However, contrary to their view comes my perspective that it is the improvement of the appearance of old facilities that is the attraction to tourists.
12.0	My point can be well elaborated as follows.
6.0	To begin with, only when a city has a marked building can its scenic spots be more likely to make a deep impression on tourists.
8.0	To elaborate, the apperance of building and streets is usally regarded as the culture and feature of a country.
8.0	If there are so many landmark buildings, the govenment can make it easier for tourists to be involved in the special dail life of the local people.
8.0	However, Without a beatiful and well-designed architecture, people might find it difficult to figure out the culture and custom of a country.
8.0	Therefore, chances are that tourists could not be immersed in a wonderful envirnment and not to mention a perfect tourist experience.
8.0	For example, in our country, there are many old relics being renew with symbol of religion, power and good wishes, which attracts a million people came from other country to admare our culture.
8.0	Had not our government built plenty of beautiful building, our country could have not attracted so many tourists.
1.0	Second, it is the tiny and well-arranged street that make it pissible for people to go around the city more convinent.
1.0	To illustrate, with the tiny street, the government can not only bring the tourists a good envirnment but also make to easier to walk trough one scenior to another.
3.0	Nowadays,  as the development of society, kids have much more desire for varies of goods or serivce.
3.0	In addition, some parent believed in the offering money for higher grade of their children, is a good way in motive their children of study harder.
12.0	However, it is not a very appropriate method in my assessment.
4.0	Admittedly, giving money to children do offered them a considerable purchased force to buy whatever they want, which imposed a great motive on children of getting better grade.
8.0	however, they do get their good grade, do they actually gain the education they should receive?
8.0	Apparently not.
8.0	Because when parents say the they are offering money for thier better academic behaviour, they also invisiblely transfered the children's attention from being a better person to gaining more money.
8.0	It is a misleading of children's moral view, and it is not beneficial to their future since if they only care about money, instead of remaining the character of simpethetic or considerate or loving, they will become horrible and lack of responsibility, due to the only thing in their eyes is money.
4.0	Take the topic in a simpler perspective, what children sre demanding is not always pleasing, for example, if a child wants to buy video game, or even crazy, ciggerette, as they want to experience the sense of smoking they are curioused to, it is horrible, too when having these result.
10.0	These examples indicstied that what children want is not always healthy, so it should be considered becareful and give enough education to children of waht they are going to buy in a objective perspective.
4.0	At last, I disagree with this view because it can not last very long.
10.0	When children already received what they want from the previous reward, they may lack of motive for the next coming exam, incidentally, everything will came back to normal.
2.0	In conclusion, I do not think that the idea of giving money to students to stimulate their grade is a good idea and we should think of alternative ideas of encouraging them.
3.0	As the world comes into the Internet era,people's demand on the access to the web is getting higher.
3.0	As a result,some people may hold the opinion that projects that aims to improve the Internet have priority than those which  improve public transportation in governments' budget.
3.0	However,to give my own point,programs that encourage the development of public transportation deserve more financial support.
4.0	To begin with,a better net of transportation will undoubtly accelerate the development in the country.
8.0	A mature system of transportation such as rail roads and airlines is the foundation of economy.
8.0	For example,in the southwestern part of China,the local economy depend heavily on the agricultural products like tea.
8.0	However,the development in those area was limited before because of the lack of transportation.
8.0	Recently,a series of public roads and rails including the high speed rails has been constructed there.
8.0	As a result,more people are able to purchase the products from there witch in turns encourage the increasement of productivity in the southwestern area in China.
4.0	Moreover,the transprotation is the bridge of cultural communication.
8.0	To illustrate this point,I would like to compare the situation in the past in China with that in the modern.
8.0	Several decades ago,communication between provinces even cities was stuck because of the unconvenience caused by poor transportation.
8.0	It took people in southern area several days to get to the north by trains.
8.0	As a result,people,including students were unlikely go to the places that were far away for study or other purposes.
8.0	As time goes by,several lines of high speed rails has been done over the country which make it possible for people to cover thousands of miles in several hours.
8.0	Thus,public communication is encouraged.
4.0	Finally,the drawbacks of improving Internet are also obvious.
9.0	Since the booming of social apps based on the Internet,communication in person between people drops.
9.0	People tend to chat with their friends through the net instead of doing it face to face.
10.0	Above all,more inveatment on public transportation
3.0	As the career concernd have provoked more and more individuals attention, nowadays there consist of a comparation about the job between the past and now.
3.0	Some people content that it's quiet  easier to find a secure work in the past and the job are capable lead to successful future while others hold the view that nowadays have more challenging but it is very helpful to provide majority dwelling to choose what kind of career they want to do, secure job doesn't means successfur for themselves.
11.0	As far as I'm concerned, there are varity kind of jobs from now on,people can choose what they like to do rather than some secuer job in their career life.
6.0	Firstly,the development of the social gives individuals more oppotunities in differents ares and everyone  have wider choose ranges than in the past.
9.0	Actually, we have taken the advantage of technology, for example like Internet, we not only use it in communication,it also enhace the working efficiency.
9.0	There can not be denied that the Internet have produced more job oppotunity in these decades and we can imagine the useful of technology.
7.0	Furthermore, secure jobs nowadays can't satiesfied with contempory person ambitiousthey are saking of creation and the
3.0	Nowadays,a lot of people prefer to see a film or read a funny book to relax themselves rather than do some sports exercise .
3.0	Therefore plent of experts and students have diferent views about that, and have made a number of discussion.
11.0	In my opinion, both sides have thire reasons, but I think physical excise is better than seeing a film or reading a funny book to relax themselves in most situations.
6.0	First of all, after a busy day of learning and working, there is less energy for people to watch movies or read books.
9.0	If we want to give a rest of our brains, the best way is sports exercise, which can make our muslcua relax and take the harmful thing away as soon as the cells of brains get away of tired.
9.0	After doing several days exercise, our body might be fresh like new-born.
7.0	Secondly, people would hurt their eyes and do harm to their bodies, if they sit in the chairs and doing the things that don't need to move just  need to use their eyes and brains after whole day work because they have already use their energy
11.0	in my opinion,I think is necessary.
11.0	Because children should pay more attention on thier high life.
12.0	student main goal is study  if they could not concentrate on thier study their  waste many time, on the other side parents also hope thier child to be successful in school they know that have a good grade in school can help them get good future,that is why many chinese parents will give their children shool_age.
10.0	because they hope their children could focus on study.
6.0	First of all,if child get the  school-age by themselves,they may put more time on study ,they know study well can heip them to get what they want ,there is no doubt that children's grade will be effected on good way,so parents should give their children school_age money as reward.
7.0	second,it is important to give child motive to study because study can easily g
11.0	Nowadays, people are busier than before because of their pressure of substantial life, so there are more and more modern people devore to finish their work in short time, and use their remaining time to do other things they need or they want.
12.0	However, I totally contradicts with the opinion that it is more enjoyful to people work only three days a week for long hours than the people who work five days a week for shorter hours.
5.0	Firstly, the short hours make more relaxed for your life.
8.0	Provided that you work for long hours per day and you only work three days a week, you must have to feel tired when you finish your work day.
8.0	When you out of work day, and you have rest time in your remaining day, you must have to unwilling to go to work because it is so tired.
8.0	Take my cousin for example, when she joined a job which was five days a week, but for shorter time.
8.0	She got up late in the morning and slept early.
8.0	Therefore, her attitde toward life is positive, she like her work and life.
5.0	Secondly, most of your life will be more meaningful l if you work five days a week.
8.0	Take myself for example, when I have a three day per week part time job,  and if I rest at home for too long, I will feel the life is full of boring, because I play computer games and mobile phone for whole day, and I do not want to sleep anymore.
8.0	I do not know what can I do, and what I should do next, I felt my life is meaningless.
8.0	However, when I attended to the job which was five days a week, I had many things to do everyday, and I could go out  almost everyday.
8.0	Even though the work time was short, after working hours I always went out to see movies with my workmates.
7.0	Adimittedly, we can do many other things in our rest days, however if we
3.0	It is universally acknowledged that any successful team is bound to have a very excellent leader.
12.0	Nowadays when it comes to the issue of leadership, different people always hold different opinions.
11.0	As for some of them ,they deem that leadership often comes from one's own birth and it is natural.
11.0	However, there are also some voices that think the leadership can also be nurtured through a series of efforts.
11.0	To be honest, I partly agree with the statement that leadership comes naturally.
11.0	The gene may play a role in it, however, that ought not to be the total factor.
5.0	During my university life, I took part in the Student Union in my department when I was a freshman.
8.0	At that time, I made the acquaintance of a boy called Wei.
8.0	He was the same age as me and we got along well with each other.
8.0	Actually, he was a shy boy and not very active during every meeting and activities at the beginning.
8.0	Later I asked him the reason why he chose to participate in the Student Union with his silent character.
8.0	He explained to me that He wanted to make changes about it and would like to spare no effeorts to become more outgoing.
8.0	I admired his action and thought it was very inspiring.
8.0	Then things became different since that time.
8.0	It can be easily seen that he was always the first person to volunteer to do some heavy work in our team in the next period of time.
8.0	In addition, he became more courageous during every meeting and often gave his own illustration towards some hard questions.
8.0	At first we were all not accustomed to his change.
8.0	Nevertheless, we gradually understood him and always try to encourage him.
8.0	As a result, he was totally different at the end of semester and was elected to be our team leader in the next term.
5.0	According to the example of my friend Wei, I really think that the nurturing after one's birth is also vital and some people have the ability to learn and succeed in becoming a leader although he is not very gifted at the beginning stage.
9.0	On the other hand, there is no doubt that those talented people who are doomed to be a leader do exist.
9.0	But from my perspective, these people only make up small percentages in our society.
0.0	"Well goes an old saying, ""no pains, no gains."""
0.0	I am in favor of the view that most things can be achieved through our hard work.
0.0	If some people want to beome a leader, he should also pay efforts to accomplish that.
0.0	In conclusion, I deem that leadership partly comes naturally and partly derives from our diligence.
3.0	Many concern about the education of the younger generation, and there is an certain concern about how to motivate children to keep study and get a good gradem.
12.0	Some people may argues that parents should not give their children money as a reward for that would give chilren a bad hint that money is all that matters and then make them money-oriented.
12.0	However, I am not with this idea and I contend it's a good way to make them dive into their study, motivating them to try their best in the study and the exams and teaching them how to use money properly.
5.0	First, in this way, children have the reason to focus on  their study and keep trying to get a good grades.
8.0	There is no denying that todays there are so many interesting things, like all kinds of computer games and TV shows, at least in children's mind, that will distract them from learning and lead to bad grades.
8.0	But what if they can get money after they get a goo grade in the exam?
8.0	Wondering about all the sweat candies they can get using these money, they just want to get down to study right now!
8.0	It's the things they are thirsty for and could be bought with money that motivate them to study.
5.0	Second, rewarding them with money can teach them how to manage their own money at the same time, which is a vital ability during their whole life.
8.0	To illustrate, my parents always gave me a small mount of money whenever I got good grades in exams, but with money I got each time, I could not buy anything I actually want, like a pair of Nike basketball shoes or some nice T-shirt.
8.0	Learning from my mother that I could buy these if I deposited the money I got, I did as she said and finally I bought the awesome shoes.
8.0	So tricky a way it is to teach children how to use their money, giving them little money each time.
0.0	With the development of the need for the well-educated, it's exactly what's in parents mind to make their children get good grades, enter into the best university and get a promising job latter in their life.
0.0	Giving money maybe is not a perfect way to reward children but it can motivate children and teach them to form a good habit of using money.
0.0	I think it worths it.
3.0	Nowdays, education is something that nobody can ignore and because parents have more time than before so they will care for their children the grades in school such as the math or English task just taken a few days ago or the grades of the final exam.
3.0	Also the parents will ask their children to do for the extra courses they sign for children like piano or basketball course since they have more money for this than before.
3.0	Besides, the concept that education is the most important thing one person's life is alo very common among  parents, which was not realized by most parents in the past.
12.0	So we can draw the conclusin that parent ssurely want to be more envovled in children's education than before.
4.0	First, parents have more time than before, which offer the condition where they can spend time on children's education.
8.0	For example, in the past, parents could spend most of their time to figure out how to make a living or feed the family, so they may spend most of their time on field to make the crops grow better and make the cattles grow up normally.
8.0	I believe most children at that time saw their parents working on the field frequently, becasue life at that time was so tough that making money already took almost all time of paretns .
8.0	But now, parents have weekends to talk to their children about their grades in school like how the math or English subject goes in their school and is ther anything that they cannot work.
4.0	Second,parents have more money than before, so they tend to invest to their children's educatin because it's almost the most important in one person's life.
9.0	For example, in the past, a child whose family had enough money to help him to study in an university is envied by other family and friends because this would cost much money which was something that a formal family couldn't afford.
9.0	But now,look around you, and you will find that most of your classmates even study abroad which cannot be immagine in the past, and their parents even want to send them to more countries to let them look at how advanced the world is so the children can have better education.
4.0	Last, the concept has changed since in the past, family did't care the children's education like today.
8.0	It's very common to see that how they colleague arrange their children's summer vacation to take some musicial or physical coursed to make them better literal in the offices.
8.0	But in the past, you could never hear the parents fo different children talking about something like this, because they didn't realize how the education matters in one person's life.
8.0	And children at that time surely suffered the inliteralness, so they will never let this things happen in their children's life.
3.0	Nowdays, education is very important.
3.0	Childrens often make mistakes.
12.0	Parents usually do not forgive them.
11.0	Many people disagree the statement but I agree the statement that parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.
5.0	First of all, parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.
8.0	They should go through some setbacks, they konw that anything is not  easy.
8.0	For example, Si Maguang is famous people in China.
8.0	When he is a chlid, he makes a mistake that
5.0	Second, when children make some mistakes, they can differ right things form wrong.
8.0	To illustrate, when I was a 7 years old child.
8.0	I used other child's pencil but I do not told him.
8.0	Then he found pencil spending long time.
8.0	He was very unhappy.
1.0	In smmary, parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.
1.0	For these reasons, I agree with the statement that parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes and when children make some mistakes, they can differ right things form wrong.
12.0	When we go outside ,we may meet some terribe thing that we can not solve it by ourselves ,if some  strangers could help us ,we will feel positive and thankful ,then , we will have the trend to believe others and be glad to help others ,so people now are more likely to help strangers who are getting in trouble .
10.0	Even though we may be deceived by some unkind people ,we still believe society will become much better ,and we will take part in the construction of society and optimize every details to realize our dreams ,to build a society that all of us can equal and contribute our energy to solve the problem what human is facing .
3.0	With the development in society, people have a geat amount of need in both public transportation and internet access to bring more convenience for their lives.
3.0	So whenever asked whether it is more important for governments to spend money to improve internet access than to improve public transportation, people usually exhibit an air of uncertainty.
11.0	However, I wholeheartedly agree that it is more important to spend money to improve public transportation.
4.0	First of all, I think public tranportation is a symbol of both the city and the country.
8.0	The development of transportation partly reveal whether the nation is wealthy and well-developed.
8.0	When people travel in another country, they will absolutely take several types of public transportation in the country, and this will give them the first impression of the country.
8.0	Take my British friend's experience as an example.
8.0	My friend saul came to Wuhan last summer, and when he arrived in Wuhan, he take the subway right away without waiting for the buses.
8.0	And the days after, he traveled almost everywhere in Wuhan by subway.
8.0	And the most excellent thing he said was that we have sharing bicycles almost everywhere so that he can go anywhere he likes without traffic jams.
8.0	He said that travel in China is very convenience and developed, and he loves China very much.
8.0	So I think public transportation do can reveal how the nation is developed.
4.0	Then, it's more important to spend money on public transportation because if most people go outside by public transportation, it can do good to our environment.
8.0	Nowadays, the global warming is a great issue.
8.0	So I think if every person choose to go outside by public transportation, it can decrese the emission of carbon dioxide, which may lead to global warming.
8.0	However, people will be willing to travel by public tranportation only when the public tranportation is very convenience, comfortable and cheap.
8.0	So government should spend more money to develop the public tranportation in order to save the earth.
4.0	Last but not the least, I admit that it is also important to deveop the internet access.
10.0	With the development of the accessment of internet, people may have more fun when they surfing the internet.
4.0	However, one disadvantage is that when internet access is way too developed, people will not be willing to go outside to feel the nature.
8.0	Because they can have a lot of fun just stay inside.
8.0	And this is absolutely not healthy for both of their mental and phisical health.
8.0	But with the development of the public tranportation, people can go to a lot of interesting places more easily.
8.0	And this is great, isn't it?
2.0	So, as far as I am concerned, it is more important to spend more money on public tranportation than internet access, not only for individuals but also for the earth.
11.0	Because of the large pressure of the modern society,more and more people are trying to find some good ways to relax themselves.
12.0	Some of them choose to watch movie or read a book ,while others prefer to do physical exercise.
12.0	and nowdays,some people propes suach a idea that it is a betterr to rela by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercis.
11.0	As far as I am concerned,All of them are great ways to relax,watching a movie or reding abook is no better than doing physical exercise.
4.0	First of all,different people have different intersts,they may have opposite feeling while doing the same thing.
8.0	Supped that a person who hate reading and obbessed with running arround is forced to read a book?
8.0	There is no possibility for him to feel relaxed,he would even feel tired.
8.0	At last ,for him individual,reading a book is not a good way to relax.
8.0	Such a truth is the same with the people who dislike reading or watching a movie.
8.0	For them ,relax by this way is not a good choice.
4.0	I have to admit that watching a movie is a enjoyale thing to some people.
8.0	The fantasy story can impress you and give you a feeling fo leaving the pressure of modern world.
8.0	However,doing physical exercise can do the same things.
8.0	If you are fortunate enough to do some sports like basketball with friend and beat your enemy,the passion of fighting will fulfill your heart,you will also feel happy and forget the pressure from your job or study,which relax you a lot.
4.0	There is an another benefit of doing physical exercise which watching or reading couln't have.
8.0	Doing sports is good for your health.
8.0	The importance of health is needn't to say more,with a body in  illness,you will never feel relaxed.
8.0	Because of the busy work,many modern people have no time to exercise,which make their health condition become worse and worse.
8.0	Relaxing by doing physical exercise can solve such a delimma which can be never solved by watching a movie or reding a book..
1.0	For those people who like exercising ,doing physical exercise can not only make them feel relaxed, but also good for their helath,easure their happiness in the following life.
1.0	According to these reason I  have mentioned  above , I think there is every reason to draw a conclusion that it is not better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.
3.0	Work is not only a means to earn money, but also it's a way to realize one person's value.
11.0	Some people think that workers are more satisfied when they are just doing the same things all along because it's easy to do.
11.0	However, I think that workers are more satisfied when they have mnay different types of work to do.
4.0	Firstly, doing many different types of work means you be needed in many areas and it's can realize your value better.
8.0	Reliable is a great comment for one person and you'll be willing to ask him to do a favor.
8.0	Thus, in the company, the leaders will give the workers who are reliabe better positions and higher payment.
8.0	And reliable workers are more easily to realize their vaule to the society because so many people need them.
8.0	Thus, if you doing many diiferent types of works, it means that you are developing to a reliable person.
8.0	Since you are good at so many areas and you can handle all kinds of challange, people will trust you that you can perform well in any situations.
8.0	Thus earning more money can improve your living condtion and realizing your value can make you feel great and these will make you feel satisfied.
4.0	Secondy, doing many differnet types of tasks can improve your ability and it can help you do smoothly in your future work.
8.0	Admittedly, if you are not good at many areas, it's difficult and tired for you to do different types of work.
8.0	However, no one can be good at anything when he was born.
8.0	Thus, you can learn how to deal with such so many different tasks during praticing.
8.0	Your ability won't improve unless you practice your ability often.
8.0	Since, if you try to take different types of tasks, you can improve your ability.
8.0	Thus you can so smoothly in your future work and be cofidient for any situations or problems.
8.0	You'll be more satisfied when you find that you already have the ability to deal with most things.
4.0	Admittedly, doing easy things won't be as stressful as doing different and hard tasks.
8.0	However, easy also means tedious and bored.
8.0	You won't find fun and growth if you only do the things easy all day long.
8.0	You'll feel bored and can't even do those easy things well.
8.0	Nowadays, we are getting into informantion ages.
8.0	These easy and repeatedly work can be replaced by the robets.
8.0	So that this work don't need you and you can't realize your value and certainly you'll lose the job.
8.0	You won't feel satisfied when you're in such situation.
2.0	That's why I think that workers are more satisifed when they're doing many different types of tasks.
11.0	Today we will discuss a statement about if people are more willing to help the struggling strangers.
11.0	In my opinion,the answer is yes.
11.0	With the development of economy,more and more people have recevied excellent education,which means they are more merciful than before.
12.0	Besided this,some people's religion belief require them to help those people in need.
5.0	Although there were some people who are indifferent with the things happen around them,most of us have nice willing to help the struggling strangers.
10.0	For example,few of the olds had betrayed the people who helped to send them to the hospital,but we sitll to do more to asure their safety.
5.0	Not only this,but also another kind of things.
10.0	Now when some people have diagnosed terrible illness,but their family can not aford the high bill,the nice people from all over the world will come to donate money to help them pass the poor condition or give them some courage to rebuild the familey's comfidence.
2.0	As far as I am concern,our society is not pefect,but we
3.0	One thing that all parents concern about is the grade their children get in the school.
3.0	In order to improve children's grade, parents figure out several solutions.
3.0	Among these solutions, awarding children who get high grade with money seems to be very effective.
11.0	However, as far as I am concerned, this is not a good solution.
4.0	Firstly, the money reward will give children a wrong attitude toward studying.
8.0	Children cannot figure out their true feelings within since they are not fully mature, so they are very easy to influence by their parents.
8.0	If the parents award the children when they get high grade, they are supposed to encourage children to do better in the future.
8.0	However, children cannot distinguish between the hapiness they gain from the high grade and the one they gain from the award.
8.0	They may think their happiness and satisfaction come from the money, and will think that the money is want they want.
8.0	If children have the idea that they study becuase of the money, it will not be beneficial for them to pursue big success.
4.0	Moreover, this method may induce children to do some bad behavior in order to get high grade.
8.0	Sometimes, the children are so eager to have the money, so they may cheat to obtain them.
8.0	To illustrate, my cousin is in high school.
8.0	His father once told him that if my cousin could get a  certain grade, he would buy him a new phone.
8.0	My cousin was so fond of the phone, but he now that he couldn't make it.
8.0	To solve this problem, he cheated in the exam, which was discovered by teacher later.
8.0	If his father had not garanteed the reward, my cousin have not done this.
4.0	It is true that the money can do some good thing to the children.
9.0	Some children who do not like studying may begin to study because of the award.
9.0	However, it is not the effective method to encourage them to love study, and it may lead to bad behaviors.
1.0	Taking into account all the fact above, I disagree with the idea that the children should be rewarded because of their high grade.
1.0	To stimulate students' studying interest, parents should find other effective sollutions.
12.0	In my opinion, when find some mistake, waiting the meeting end then tell the teacher or leader is better.
12.0	It is not polite to teacher or leader that interrupting and correcting the mistake right away.
12.0	When you are talking to your friends, other one suddenly intterupt your conversation.
12.0	You must be unhappy.
10.0	Like my foriegn teacher, he hate other one interrupt him when he is talking.
10.0	Teacher or leader can know your ability and make a good impression on you if you talk to them that they have mistake after class or meeting.
3.0	Someone might question that, why should we concern about what is hapening around the world?
3.0	They would probably say that it's none of  our business.
11.0	But from my perspective, I'm absolutly sure that knowing events happening around the world is of great importance for us even if they will not affect our daily life.
5.0	Lets take my own experience for example.
8.0	Before entering university, I care little about news around the world, simply holding the opinion that they can't affect my daily life.
8.0	Then I went to college and majored in geophysics for a period.
8.0	However, I remember when I finished a writting a program about petro discovering, my professor asked me to do a research    about the price of gasoline during last century around the world.
8.0	You can't imagine how embrassing it was for a student like me, who only knows how to program and study desplinary theories, to do that research.
8.0	So I can just went for help from my roomate who reads global newspapers everyday and knew lots of those I regarded as 'unuseful things'.
8.0	It was then did I realize the importance for me to get in touch with events happening around the world.
8.0	I finally understood that they may not affect our daily life at present, but they will probably be useful for us in the future, which I can't foresee right now.
5.0	Additionally, we can be helpful to our friends or classmates through knowing about events happening around the world.
8.0	Imagine one of my friends plan to take a trip to north America and turned to me for some suggestions and what he should be caution of.
8.0	If I already know what is happening right there, I can indeed offer great help to him.
8.0	And our friendship will be strengthened.
8.0	So it seems like these things are none of our business, but it can indeed help our friends and make us mor famous.
7.0	All in all, it is important for us to know about events happening
3.0	The significance of children's education can never be overempasizies, because it's closely to one' s succees in the future.
3.0	Recently, thera have been a lot of controversies about what time is the diffcultest task: today or in the past.
3.0	Towards such a long-running tug-of-war, i am related choose educating children is a more difficult task today.
12.0	And i also have some reasons and examples to illustrate my point of views.
5.0	First of all, the new technologe have much influence on students education.
8.0	As we all known, the technology is develop, more and more interesting things are produced, thus, students will like playing this to spending long time, then they do not have enough time to study and wheh they do homework or studing acadamic subject in class, they will distraction from the playing games.
8.0	For example, i have a young brother is named James, he studing in the middlle school, his favourite activity is playing phone games with his friends, in the weekend, he seems playing the phone all day, he playing phone in the class, too.
8.0	No body can keep him to playing, therefore, his performance of task is so bad, nobody can save him.
5.0	Also, spend so much time on games,phone and computer is unhealthy to students' body in physical.
8.0	There is no doubt that spending much time on playing electronic games is bad to eye sight.
8.0	According to the statistics of high school's students of moype from the Health Apartment of university of Cambridge, the students of moype have 95% people like playing electronic games.
8.0	If the students' sight is no good, it is not convnient to studying in class, such as, students cannot see the blackbored and not understand what the teacher impate, thus he cannot get good performance of task.
2.0	All in all, i agree this statement.
12.0	Struggling strangers are worth help from others.
12.0	Their efforts make them respectful, people are paying more and more attention to those strangers who work hard.
11.0	When people help others, they gain pleasure as well.
11.0	For these two reasons, people of course would like to help the struggling strangers.
6.0	In the past, some people are always worried that whether strange people will mistake and balme me for my hand of help.
8.0	Actually, it is hard to avoid this kind of concerns.
8.0	I'd like to show one example about my own experience.
8.0	Once there was a time I really wanted to learn how to bike, so I went biking on the playground in a big park.
8.0	Unfortunately, I was so afraid of falling down from the bicycle that I only dared to use one foot to ride and another food to reach the land.
8.0	Every time I was trying to use both feet, the bike couldn't balance no more.
8.0	I almost couldn't count how many times I fell down.
8.0	Finally, there was a
0.0	Nowadays, all of us know that when you give others rose, you will get pleasure.
0.0	Luckily, if one successfully offerd help to someone strange, the sense of happinese would keep him or her company and become a strong passion to encourge him or her to continue the kindness.
0.0	Hence, more and more get to know that it is not so bad to help struggling stangers, the kind action is goning to be passed down for this reason.
3.0	Obviously work is an essential part in our live;therefore Some government decides to spend money on teaching adults after 25 years old for these most up-to-dated skills at work place in order to help adults embrace a good performance at work place.
12.0	Nevertheless, I totally disagree with this behavior.
5.0	In the first place, different people have different working skills; in this way, people are supposed to use suitible skills rather than the most up-to-date skills tought by the government.
8.0	For instance, in economic field, different people have their own way to work based on their own strong abilitiy.
8.0	Some people who master analysing ability and collecting information ability can collect all history tendency of market and analysis future direction.
8.0	However, some people who are genious on math can use their acounting ability to make mathmatics modles and then directely use these modles to account profits.
8.0	Obviously, owning to the fact that different people have different dorminance, it is a waste of time and money for the government to spend money on training course provided for these adults.
8.0	Eventhough the government teach their up-to-dated skills at workplace, these people may not follow these skills and they may still maintain their own means because these skills are unappreciate for them.
5.0	Secondly, different work field request different skills, it is hard for government to ensure a up-to-date skill for people.
8.0	For instance, some government think that the most up-to-date skill in workplace is to embrace the computer skills in work.
8.0	Sure, the computer skills can actually help people who are work in field related to internet such as electronic inventors.
8.0	However, for the gym teachers and some clean staffs, they never touch computer in their workplace.
8.0	Therefore, it is a waste of time and money for the government to teach all adults whose work are unrelated to computer such as clean staffs and gym teachers.
8.0	Therefore, this government program is only useful for part people.
7.0	To sum up, it is not a effective way for government to teach all adults the most up-to-date skills because different people have diffrent strong field and they shoud chose on their onw
7.0	and it is unneces
12.0	Ok ,now I'd like to talk about whether parents should give their children extra money for their good grades.
11.0	First, I'd like to say there are many kind of things can change people's  emotions that can offer  power to go forward.
12.0	Such as preassure,hope,scary,and self-control ability.
12.0	Of crouse, money can play the same kind of role.
9.0	When people have something they want in mind, there is reason for them to work hard to earn this.
9.0	So I think if we want to improve our chiildren's behavior in school, it may be a efficient way to reward then moey.
6.0	But, we know that every coin has to sides, so what do they lose in this kind of process?
8.0	First, the children now know that as long as they get good grades they will get something they want.
8.0	So these students know have specific dream that they are willing to work hard for.
8.0	But is this what they want?
8.0	What about there turly dream?
8.0	Aren't there anything that is more important to them to go for?
8.0	So I think in some degree, giving them money is to make them be blind.
8.0	Who give them they way to go is their parents not themselves.
8.0	So, they may lose many wonderful things in their way of life.
8.0	Second, the reason that they work hard is that the emotion caused by money give them the power.
8.0	If this process repeat many many times, I think their is a tendency for them to come to the emotion  money has brought.
8.0	Some emotion comes from thoughts.
8.0	Without various emotions, they life maybe less interesting,  and their thoughts may be restricted in some aspects.
8.0	So I think if we keep on treat our children in this way, we will lose more than what we gain.
0.0	At last, I want to repeat what I have said.
0.0	Much power comes from our emotion.
0.0	So, I think first we should think about what kind of man we really want our children to be.
0.0	All those kind of ways to push them on have advantages and disadvantages.
0.0	But I think we shouldn't deny any kind of way, just try each of them, and then let the fact to help us to make the choices.
0.0	I believe this will give us a better answer.
3.0	I still remember last semester when I finished a computer science project alone and the mixture of a sense of satisfactory and accomplishment I got from it.
3.0	I'm convinced that many people will be familiar with this feeling.
11.0	So when it comes the question that which methods can let the students learn more effectively when they handle their assignment, I think working alone is a better one because students can learn every aspect of the knowledge and have a better understanding of them.
5.0	Firstly, working alone can make the students understand the whole content of the knowledge.
8.0	It's common sense that when you work in a group, you don't need to do all the work, what you are required to finish is just part of it.
8.0	This condition can also occur when teachers ask students to finish their assignment together.
8.0	However, contrary to working together, working alone means you have to do all the work that is related to the project.
8.0	Consequently, you can go through all the knowledge and learn to use them to solve the problem, which will result in learning all aspects of the knowledge.
5.0	Moreover, you can have a comprehensive understanding of the knowlege and digest them competely when you finish the assignment alone.
8.0	Being confronted with problems in the course of dealing with the assignment is common.
8.0	When you work in a group, the group member may tell you what's wrong with your work or help you get out of it.
8.0	Even though the result is that the problem is solved, because you don't know the theory in it, you learn nothing.
8.0	On the other hand, you are supposed to finish the problem on your own when you work alone.
8.0	For example, when you are dealing with a math problem.
8.0	You use all the theories, examples and methods you have learnt to try to work it out.
8.0	When you finish the problem eventually, your math ability increased a lot.
1.0	Lastly, even though some people may argue that working together can let the student working on difficult problems or projects of a larger scale, which cann't be done when students work alone.
1.0	However, what we are talking now is how to let students learn effectively rather that how to let students work on a bigger project.
12.0	Recently, too many familys are getting richer and richer, which results for a new problem that is whether should parents reward money to their children when they get good grade in school.
11.0	in my opinion ,I think it is a wrong behavior, which make children more proposal.
5.0	At the first, we should change our mind about why kids should study hard.
8.0	That the mind is kids study hard for themselves instead of others.
8.0	On the other words, that the parents give their children life is the biggest reward, so, the kids' duties are studying hard and giving their parents a good old life.
8.0	The kids are too young that they even don't know how to spend money in a good way.
8.0	I can not imagine what they will be when they have been treated on some days.
8.0	For instance, when I was young, I have been treated which caused I lost money.
8.0	Money is evil which should be pretend to appear in the kids' life.
5.0	Secondly, it is wrong that I do not agree with parents reward their children.
8.0	I rarely think parents should change the way they reward kids like use buyying toys or taking kid to trip.
8.0	For kids, they need to discover that what the earth looks like.
8.0	Compared with using money, these ways are better for children's grow.
10.0	To be conclude
3.0	In such a state-of-the-art of the education age, people become more likely to pay attention to the education or some academic issues.
11.0	Nowadays, there is a issue that what will you do if the teacher or the meeting leader says something oncorrect in your opinion has appeared.
12.0	And this problem provoks a highly debate among people.
12.0	Some hold that we should interrupt the teacher immediately and correct the teacher's idea on class.
12.0	However, as for me, we should wait until the class or meeting is over and people are gone, and then talk to the teacher or meeting leader.
12.0	And my reasons are given below.
5.0	First and foremost, we should await because we should consider about the feeling of the professors.
8.0	Take one of  my relative's experience as an example, my cousin, who just entered the college last year, and in one of his tutor's lecture, which he just potinted out the mistake that contradicted his idea of the tutor on class.
8.0	And after that lecture, his tutor's attitude to him became icy because he just made the tutor lose face on class.
8.0	Maybe this is the real human nature in our lives.
8.0	Thus, we should wait until the class over to discuss these kinds of problems with the professor instead of arguing with the professor rudely.
5.0	Plus, we should keep our thinking until the class comes to end because the time is limited and it will interrupt the whole thinking of the tutor.
8.0	At most of the time, the time in every single class is limited and precious.
8.0	It is not tough for us to guess what will happen if we just argue with the professor on class instead of allowing the professor persue the cadence of the whole class--students will be influenced and interrupted, too.
8.0	And this kind of behavior will have some interference in professor's thinking, whcih would cause the class's quality.
8.0	Hence, we'd better to keep calm when we find contradictions because we need to concider others.
2.0	To summrize, although it is really hard for us to keep calm or keep silent when we find some opinions which just contradicts our idea, we need to concern others' feeling in the situation.
11.0	Nowadays, many people think that government should invest more money in arts than in sports.
11.0	There are many reason why they consider art more important: Art works are beautiful and can be appreciated by everyone from everywhere, which may accelerate the diplomacy with foreign countries.
12.0	And some think that seeing art works, they can release their stress.
11.0	However, in my opinion, more money should be put to support athletics.
5.0	First, more money invested in sports, people will be encouraged exercising and become healthier.
8.0	If the government spend more money to support athletics, common people will notice that their country is focusing on sports now and spontaneously attach more importance to their own exercisement, which eventually lead to their being healthier.
8.0	Besides, it is likely that the athletes from state-sponsored Olympic teams uses this money to search more opportunities to gain better training, because of which they receive better grade and be the heroes of everyone watching them.
8.0	Being proud of this athletes, people cannot help themselves doing sports.
5.0	Furthermore, people's own country will be admired more by others.
9.0	Possessing better equipment and being better trained, athletes have larger chance to perform will and win the medols.
9.0	Then, other countries will awared that this country is so strong and has so many good ahletes that they should admire them.
12.0	News are very important aspect in our lives, we all follow what is happening around us on the daily basis.
12.0	Thanks to the globalization, news happened in every part of the world can be spreaded in a second,.
12.0	Therefore, quite a number of people doubt whether we have to pay our precious time and limited energy to pay attention to events that are irrelevant to our lives.
12.0	As far as I am concerned, although it may be slightly time-consuming, to learn what happed aroud the world will benefit us in some aspects.
12.0	My reasons and examples are given below.
6.0	Firstly,, knowing variety news enable us broad our horizons and help us make right decisions.
10.0	Many Chines parents regard America as their first choice for their children to seek future study, and sometimes may neglect children themselves will.
7.0	Take my cousionrent
3.0	Whether older people need to learn new things is always a heated debate topic in the society.
11.0	Some people think older people don't need to learn, however, in my opinion, it is still important for older people to keep learning.
12.0	My points can be elaborated as fellow.
5.0	First of all, to keep learning helps older people to live a happier life.
8.0	Learning can bring changes to their life.
8.0	The knowledge is not important anymore, and what matters is getting into new environment and meeting new people.
8.0	The new things keep older people away from loneliness, so they can live a full life as before.
8.0	Onthe contrast, some people have been tired of learning, thus they think when they retire, they don't need to learn anymore so they can relax.
8.0	But when they really retire, their life become so dull that they cannot bare it and they turn to learning new things.
8.0	For example, many older people go to adult college.
8.0	They don't really need the degree, but they feel full and happy in the school.
8.0	Even though their memory is not as good as before, it doesn't affect their study at all.
8.0	They can discuss with their classmates, and enjoy the process of learning.
5.0	Moreover, to keep learning helps older people to keep a clear mind.
8.0	Older people usually suffer from bad memory, and it become the excuse for them to stop learning.
8.0	However, when they stop learning, they find their memory decrease even faster.
8.0	Because of the structure of brain, we need to use it frequently to keep it active.
2.0	To sum up, older people still need to learn.
12.0	To be honest, i think it is a great idea for parents to enrouage their children by giving gift instead of offering them money.
8.0	If you buy them a present after they get high grade in tests.
8.0	It will not only enrouage them to spend more time on thier school work.
8.0	But also show your love and care for them as parent.
8.0	Someone may say that offer them money can make the same effect.
8.0	But in my opinion, giving children too much extra money means you lose control of thier space time.
8.0	In fact, children's self control may less than adult.
8.0	So it would be best to increase thier spare money as they grow up, but not as they get good grades.
8.0	What's more, a present between parent and children could have more value than some cash.
8.0	It can shape the distant between them and creat good memory in children's childhood.
8.0	in sum, just giving them money after they get high grade in thier test is unaccesptable, it would be better to change into something else.
8.0	like presnts or a family trip.
3.0	Can you imagine what things would like to be when there is no new fancy or idea from youth which would have massive influence on the future society?
3.0	Have you ever consider about the consequence of maintain one antique idea to support whole society for decades of years or even hundreds of years?
3.0	The answer are evidently not really comfortable, simply because the whole age is changing, the thought of human being is developing, and the new era of the decades of future years is coming.
12.0	For the new society, the thought and ideas of young people is necessary.
6.0	Now we could imagine a world which has enough legislation and technology to rule and feed the whole world and all the people, while they are steable and unalertable forever.
8.0	And few things would be worse than that.
8.0	This is because we are always thinking the now, but without the future, and all things are going to be out of the time and sophisticated, so we need pay highly heed to the youngesters' viewpoints and ideas to have more technology promotions.
8.0	For instance, the parking lots.
8.0	All of us must know there are a lot of parking lots in this world, when we want to buy some staff, jog in a park, or go to work, we need to find a place to park our cars first, and the parking lot is a good aid for us.
8.0	But have you ever think about what we could do if there are more cars in the future years, maybe there will have 2 or 3 times cars than nowadays, would the parks become effective again?
8.0	And few months ago, a bunch of young sciencists in Dubai invented a kind of high-effeciency parking lot which could be a safe and large container of cars in underground, just occupy little place on the ground.
8.0	And this just figures out the big potential problem in the future which comes from the normal parking lots of old ideas.
8.0	This is exactly why young people must have huge influence on the important that determine the future of this society.
2.0	It is not about the guys who have more experience become important to the future, or the guys who have more prestige who have more influence on the future, but it is the precursor of the thought and the world's developong vilocity just like the bunch of youngesters in Dubai who have the most important influence on the future.
3.0	Currently ,a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate-whether the government is supposed to hire more police to ensure safety or improve the appearance by improving the old buildings and streets.
3.0	Opinions vary from individual to individual.
3.0	Some people disagree with the proposal.
3.0	Nevertheless, I hold a favorable view to this idea.
11.0	My view can be elaborated as follows.
5.0	First of all, the public tend to be in favor of those places of interest with good safety conditions.
8.0	To be more specific, all people take safety as a priority, and all of their activities are done on the basis of a safe environment.
8.0	If the government is capable of hiring more police to lower the criming rate, the public will have a better sense of safety, as a consequence of which, they will be more willing to visit this place.
8.0	In contrast, how can the government have a wish that more visitors will come there even if the tourists's own safety can not be guaranteed?
8.0	A research conducted by Harvard University is a good case in point, in which scientists investigated the number of visitors abroad coming to America for travelling after the 9.11 terrorist attack, aiming to find out the connection between safety of a place and its popularity.
8.0	It turned out that the number of visitors abroad declined nealy one of two comparing to before.
5.0	Furthermore, good appearances of the old buildings and streets are much more attractive for tourists.
8.0	To further illustrate my point, pursuing beauty is a character of every one of us.
8.0	All of us have a preference to beautiful things because they are a good feast for ou eyes.
8.0	So it is no doubt that people will go to those beautiful places to appreciate the beauty of the old buildings and streets.
8.0	In contrast, people will have a negetive emotion when visiting worn-out buildings.
8.0	For example, my family once made a schedule to travel during winter.
8.0	After discussion, we made a decision to go to Hainan Province because there are lots of beautiful places of interest like beaches, seas and so on.
8.0	Actually, the trees dotted with flowers, the sunlight playing on the surface of the sea, the grand buildigns kept us so spellbound that we could hardly tear our eyes away from those charming sceneries.
8.0	It is crystally clear that improving the old buildings and streets is a wise alternative.
1.0	In conclusion, in order to attract visitors, the government should hire more police to guarantee safety and improve old buildings and streets.
1.0	This is not only because that the public put the safety at the first place, but also people tend to be in favor of grand and wonderful buildings and streets.
3.0	Nowadays, the individuals are bombared with the enormous news and information on the Internet, which seem so far away from our  daily life.
3.0	Some would hold the view that the news, which serve us so conveniently, is an essential part of our life.
3.0	And the others are of the opposite sides.
11.0	From their opinion, the events happening around the world sometimes will not only be un nutritious but will be sensational, thus influence our normal life.
10.0	Personally,  it is of no importance to know everything in the world since the events happening will be a distractor of our daily life.
5.0	Initially,  the events might be boring and make our everyday life without any change.
8.0	The events explosed to our eyes might  be designed by the media and most of them will have no big difference.
8.0	Finally the individual end everyday in a countless garbagge news day.
8.0	Take my    campus roommate for instance.
8.0	She spent a large amount of time in surffing the Weibo, Chinese Twitter, to know about the stars' private life.
8.0	But actually, the news from the weibo is not that related to ordinary people.
8.0	Thus, she finished her by not attending a lot of vital courses but sharing a lot of gossip about famous stars.
8.0	Eventually, she failed in many exams.
8.0	What if she could focus more on her major and study the knowledge which is good for her future career?
8.0	So it is unnecessary to understand the irrelavant events.
5.0	In addition, the events that happens so far away from us might be terrifying, which will make the individual has an pessimistic attitude towards life.
8.0	Some of the enents life disease, war and terrorism happened beyond our country is quite devastaing.
8.0	If the individual concentrate much more on them, he or she can not go through everyday smoothly.
8.0	Imagine that one always thinks he or she will get severe disease, killed by someone else
2.0	Finally, everybody should focus on the  thing that is of  importance.
7.0	if we
3.0	The increase in development of technique in brings about a tend towards individuals' daily life that becomes more busy and hatsle because people are supposed to accomplish a number of assignments in order to rise their livng standards.
12.0	So under these circumstance, everyone are busy with doing so many different things, will it decrease their working efficieny and enable them to do very  few things well.
11.0	Take the high debate into considerartion, many people agree with the statement because there are tight time for them to finish too much work, which leads them to work in a hurry.
11.0	However, I strongly disagree with the viewpoint, and my reasons are as follows.
4.0	First of all, accomplishing many various work is beneficial for individuals to nourish some skills.
8.0	And these capacities can also help them in other feilds, which means that their abilities can bring about some unexpected consequences.
8.0	For instance, my father worked as a cheif at a restaurant called Happy Dinner.
8.0	In his daily life, he was busy with cooking some decilious food for guests.
8.0	But in some days, these is no waitress offering service for these guests, so my father had to play host to them.
8.0	After these experience, it can successfully help my father to shape his personality because he became more enthusiatic and positive.
8.0	Therefore, he was promoted due to his good charater, and he will make full use of these merits in his wokring life.
4.0	On top of that, it is extremely valuable for people to contact with diverse fields by doing many different things, and it dose npt surprise us to discover that people will socialize with many numerous people with different background.
10.0	Therefore, it is a  favourable opportunity for them to communicate with eath other and learn some great experience form other during the working time.
4.0	Admittedly, it is true that if people are busy doing so many different things, they will be disturbed and will meet a lot of problems and challenges during woking.
9.0	So finally, they must do really few things well.
9.0	However, if people can have the chance to finish many work and go through some challenges, they will be more persistent, which can help them succeed eventually.
2.0	To put all into a nutshel, I have a profound conviction that people are busy doing many things will help more to succeed instead of do few thing well
3.0	Today, education is a extreamly important part of people, and grades is a number which shows the quality students' study to students and prents, some parents treat it too seriously that they give money for each grade they have to encourage them to study.
12.0	I totally disagree with this behavior ,and againt the idea.
5.0	Moneys let students thinks that they study for money instead of themselves.
8.0	In a short time, because of the money's encouragement,students' will have a relatively high quality of studying, but this makes everything goes bad then,after getting used of studying for money, students not only get a wrong purpose of study, but having a bad understanding of money.
8.0	For example, if a child are use to getting money for every grade he made for years, one day,their parents stooped giving money, will they still tudying so hard?
8.0	so its clear that students thought that they are studying for monry.
5.0	Money given might makes child become greedy about money.
9.0	In our daily lives, if students keep receving money in the way of getting grades , they minght be used to do everything for money ,so in the future , if their parents let them do some house work at house, they might ask their parents for money , and after they going to work when growing up, they can ask for monry for every job they'v did, this not only makes their partners feeling bad , but let the company hates them.
9.0	The money givn for grades letting their childs doing everything for monry.
10.0	In conclusion ,parents should't give money for every gard
3.0	As we know, we always have to cooperate with others in order to finish a project.
11.0	Some people believe that we should communicate through emails while other believe that to communicate in person is better.
11.0	From my perspective, to communicate in person is more beneficial for doing a project.
5.0	First, to communicate in person would be efficiently to exchange the opinions.
8.0	Although sending the email is really convinient and it would cost nearly no time to receive others' reply, it is still not as efficient as talking to people in front of them.
8.0	When people talk face to face, they will realize others' attitude through observing others' face and action.
8.0	However, the attitude, which is important for human to understand others efficiently, can not be seen when people watch the screen.
8.0	Last year, I perticipated in a project about creating an app.
8.0	As a programmer, I had to realize what the function was that my boss wanted me to create, so I sent him a email to ask and I received his reply immediately.
8.0	But I couldn't understand what he wanted about the web page of logging on.
8.0	Two days later, I asked him in person, and discussed about the web page face to face.
8.0	And I could understand what he meant in about just 10 minutes.
5.0	Second, to communicate in person benefits the cooperation because it can build up the relationship between the members.
8.0	As a group, it is important to cooperating.
8.0	And build up the strength relation ship between the members can make the group become like a family which is beneficial to discuss the problems without being afraid to annoy anyone.
8.0	Thus the cooperation would become more efficiently.
8.0	For example, when I prepare the competetion with my teamates, I always tend to talk to them in person.
8.0	And one time, I joined a new team, and we cannot fiind a classroom to discuss so we sent the email to each other.
8.0	We spent the whole week to discuss but we finished nothing.
7.0	So to communicate in person is better because it can make the team like the family and be more
3.0	Nowadays, job has become a hot issue in our society because so many college students cannot find jobs.
3.0	Some people hold a view that college students should select jobs which are much same as their parents' jobs.
3.0	However,other people think that college students should select jobs totally different from their parents ' jobs.
11.0	In my opinion, I totally agree with the idea that it is much better for college students to select jobs that are much same as their parents' jobs than to select jobs different from their parents' job.
10.0	My reasons are as following:
4.0	Firstly, it is much easier for college students to participate in their parents' company.
8.0	As we know, it is more difficult for colleges students to find out a job under strong competition.
8.0	If college students choose jobs which are similar to their parents' jobs,they cannot worry about their jobs any more.
8.0	For instance, my  classmate of high school, Xiaohong, chooses a job in medical field,which is similar to their parents' jobs.
8.0	Now, she has already joined in a famous hospital in which her parents work.
8.0	She lives in a happy life with high salary.
8.0	On the contrary,my another classmate of high school,Xiaoming,selects a job different from their parents ' jobs,he does not find out a job until now.
4.0	Secondly,it is much convenient for college students who participate in their parents' company to get higher position.
8.0	Nowadays relationship in our society is very important.
8.0	If college students participate in their parents' company,they can attract more attention from leaders than other peers.
8.0	Naturally, he can get a quick promotion.
8.0	For instance, my collegues,working in the same company with her parents.
8.0	She got much attention from our leaders and have a more rapid promotion than us.
4.0	Thirdly,college students who join in their parents' company can get more knowledge than other peers.
8.0	If college students work in the same company with his parents,it means that he can obtain more care such as learning more knowledge than other collegues.
8.0	For example, my sister's collegue work in the same company with their parents, more experienced people who have good relationship with his parents are willing to teach extra knowlege for him.
8.0	For my sister, other experienced people are not willing to help her.
2.0	In conclusion, it is much better for college students to select jobs that are much same as their parents' jobs than to select jobs different from their parents' job.
12.0	I think it is ok for some parents to give their children money when they get good grade in shool.
11.0	It is not  a bad idea and here are some reasons.
4.0	first of all, parents offer their children mony when they get good grade in school in order to encourage their children.
8.0	It can inply that if the students want more money, they need to work harder to get a good mark.
8.0	When I was young, my parents always praised me when i got good grade in school with money.
8.0	So that i began to work hard from that on and earned a lot of money.
4.0	Secondly, when the students get the money as a reward, they will have no reason to ask their parents for pocket money.
8.0	And their parents will never be agitated to think about how much money should they give to their children per month or week.
8.0	If their children want money, the only way they can earn money is to get a good grade in school.
8.0	They can use the money do whatever they like.
8.0	So that it is another motivition for them to study hard in school.
4.0	Although there are a lot of different kinds of exams in school and it contains important and not so important exams, it means that if their children get good grade in every test, they should give them a plenty of money.
10.0	However, if the students indeed do that, it reflacts their children's condition in school so that they work hard every day.
1.0	Money can be a kind of reward to praise their school-age children when they get good grade in school.
1.0	The key is not that how much money they give but their children work hard in school.
3.0	How to effectively motivate students in studies has always been a difficult problem for both teachers and parents.
3.0	Some people suggest that offering money to school-age children for good grade can do the job.
12.0	However, from my perspective, I strongly disagree with this idea.
4.0	Firstly, it can give the young people the wrong idea that hardworking is just for money.
8.0	There is no denying that good grades in school can further beneifit people financially after they start to work.
8.0	But studying is definitely more than just money.
8.0	scientists work hard because they want to discover the secrets of universe.
8.0	Policemen work hard because they want to protect people from evil.
8.0	They will not think about money when they are doing their jobs.
8.0	If they do, the whole world will be in a total chaos.
4.0	Secondly, students may fail to focus on long-term goal when their works are not rewarded in real lives.
8.0	Study is the kind of thing that requires long-time effors with little feedbacks.
8.0	In an actual job position, one person may do a lot of things without other noticing him.
8.0	When this kind of situation is happening, people tend to wonder why they are doing so many seemingly meaningless works.
8.0	People can easily lose their long term goals in the process of working and then fail in their career.
8.0	So children should be taught to focus on long-term goals even though there is no feedbacks at all in the process.
4.0	Lastly, interest should the best teacher for children.
8.0	Take myself as an example, when I was learning tennis at school-age, I could practice 5 hours a day because I love it.
8.0	But when I was learning English, I barely can sit in front of desk for 1 hour even though I was offered money .
8.0	So to motivate students in studies, to stimulate children's interest should be the most consideration in teaching.
2.0	In summary, giving money to students in exchange of high grade is totally bad idea because it is not an effective way, it turns children in to money-oriented and it may make children focus
3.0	Resently, an interesting question has arosed a heated debate among people: whether they yong should follow their ambitious dreams or realistic goals?
3.0	Some people hold the belief that the toung should focue on achieving realistic goals.
3.0	However, as far as I am concerned, I stand on their opposite side.
11.0	I hold the belief that the young should follow their dreams even if the dreams are ambitious.
12.0	My points can be elaborated asfollows.
6.0	First of all, the young should pursuit something ambitious to make a lot of money to help the family nembers' survival.
8.0	A lot of young people comes from a poor family.
8.0	During their school time, they have spent plenty of money, which is real a heavy borden for their family.
8.0	Even something worse, a few families sell their houses, just in order to support their children's study.
8.0	Therefore, young people are supposed to follows some ambitious dreams and earn plenty of money to realieze their family's pressure.
8.0	For example, David, my classmate in the PeKing University, decided to become the chairman in the Shanghai Medicine company, where he could earn 10 million dollars each year, in order to suppoet his poor family.
8.0	So he tried his best to work hard.
8.0	Last the New Year, he was the only one staying on the work position.
8.0	Now, he made it and he could buy a new house for his parents.
0.0	Furtheremore, the young have enough energy and time to follow their ambitious dreams and both of energy and time will lose when they are old.
0.0	As we all know, people's energy begin to decrese with the incresing of old.
0.0	Thus, only young people can bear the ambitious work, which is always concerned as harsh and complex.
8.0	Simutanously, young people can spend enough in their failure because hard work is always accompanied by failure.
8.0	When people get older, they are inclined to live in a realistic life in order to take care of their wives(husbands) and children.
8.0	Therefore , there is also no time to be used on their fail
3.0	As the school-age children are often taking more and more exams at school, the question whether to offer children some money for high grades they get in school is a highy debated one.
3.0	On the one hand, some people think that giving money is adverse to children because they may spend money on some books or toys which may become a distraction.
3.0	On the other hand, others contend that the money offered to the children may serve as an encouragement.
11.0	In my opinion, it is a good idea to offer some money to children if they get good grades.
4.0	Above all, as an old saying goes: interest is the best teacher.
8.0	It is knowen to all that children hate examinations, and they may get bored with school if they experience a lot of exam paper.
8.0	However, if the parents can give the childre some money for award, the children may become more interested in study.
8.0	For example, when I was younger, my mother just did the same thing.
8.0	If I can get on to the top 3 of the class, I will be given 100 yuan.
8.0	I was glad about it and studied very hard.
8.0	Finally, I achieved this goal and receive money from my mother.
8.0	As you can see, this idea is good because the money can act as a kind of motivation, which can encourage children to go further.
4.0	Moreover, giving money to the children in young age can help them develope a good habit of using their own money.
9.0	In this way, the children can gradually understand that every coin of money is hard to gain, just like the fact that the high grade is also hard to get.
9.0	The young children can cherish their own properties and make a good use of their money.
4.0	Admittedly, the money given to the children may become a sort of disatraction.
8.0	The children may use it to buy some comic books or toys, which they may read or play with in the class.
8.0	However, what if the children use the money to buy some textbook or they donate the money to the charities?
8.0	It is sure a good opprtunity to cultivate the children's positive view of the world.
0.0	In conclusion,  the wise parents can use the money to educate the children and to creat a brighter future for them.
0.0	The money not only bring the children happiness and encouragement, but also gives them a good view of the world.
0.0	So I think it is a good idea to offer children some money if they get good grades.
12.0	I disagree that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
12.0	First, television advertising can expanding thinking of children.
3.0	Children aged two to five are attracted easily by many new things.
12.0	Second, television advertising are able to spread many massage to help parents.
10.0	For example, if parents don't have time to look after their young children , they can find some baby tutors or nurses to care for their children and give some preschool education for there children by watch TV advertising.
10.0	All in all,TV advertising have many benefits for children
12.0	To begin with, I agree it is better to relax by watching a movieor reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.
8.0	Watching a movie or reading a book could makes you confortabe, educated, and move your consentrition.
8.0	Firstly, in logical thinking when you are very tire you would better to watching a movie or reading a book than do physical exercise,if you do physical exericse you will feel more tire that could not achieve your goal.
8.0	The consenquence would very bad and unconfortable.
8.0	So watching a movie or reading a book is better than doing physical exercise.
8.0	Secondly, you are willing to watching a movie or reading a book you could choice an educational one.
8.0	In the one hand you get benefit from the movie and book.
8.0	In the other hand you get your goal.
8.0	Get knowledge from watching a movie is much easiler than other way.
8.0	"Finally, many scientist said:""If you move your consentrition to another direction you will remain your pressure to a little."""
8.0	In fact move consentrition is a really good way for all people.
8.0	When you watching a movie or reading a book you may forget all things around you.
8.0	Instead doing physical exercise makes you more tried.
8.0	In summery, it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.
8.0	You also could get many benefit from that way, makes you confortable during the happlyness educational experience.
8.0	education children is a more difficult task today than it was because it not only refers to teaching conditions  but also is influenced by the environment in which children study.
8.0	when it comes to compare the difficulty of educating children today with in the past, most peole will choose the former due to children are easily addicted to all kinds of internet, games, smart phones and so on.
8.0	However, education children in the old times also were confronted woth lots of problems.
8.0	so the statement is incomplete and incorrect.
6.0	it;s undeniable that nowaday teaching children is hard because there are many other things except study that attract children's eyes.
8.0	it's the advanced conentions that makes taking control of children hard.
8.0	accordign to the researches, many elementary teachers complain that many students play smartphones in class but not to listen to teachers and play online games after school instead of finishing homework.
8.0	what's worse, since children have an access to make friends on social website such as facebook and twitter, they learn some bad habbits such as cilence from bad guys on the internet.
8.0	so all thes things add more weight for teachign students because teachers will spend more tome on protecting young students from all kinds of the outside disturbances.
11.0	I'm disagree that It is better to relax by watching  movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.
6.0	"I thing the relax not only means ""have a rest"",but means ""resting youeself""."
10.0	When you watching movie or reading a book,you're not moving your body,maybe you  don't feel tired from your body,but you have to use your brain and attention,when you enjoy a story,you will feel nervous or exciting......
10.0	The exercise make us tired,but sometimes we can get ease in our mind.
3.0	Recently, whether young people like teenagers are better to make decisions about their own lives gains a lot of public attention and garadually became a hot topic.
11.0	In my opinion, it would be better of children to develop the decision making ability.
4.0	To start with, making their own decisions can cltivate their independence.
8.0	"For example, when I was young, I would always depend on my parents to make a dicision for me, becuase I thought the choise they made would be the ""best choise""."
8.0	So I slowly depends on my parents instead of taking care of my own business.
8.0	In fact, letting other make decision for you would not benefit you becuase you are closing your mind.
8.0	At last you will find it is very hard to make a decision for youself.
4.0	Second, making your own decision can motivate children's self confidence.
8.0	For instence,once they made a decision and got a good result at the end, with out doubt they will feel proud of themselves and have a sence of self-accomplishment.
8.0	I made my own decision in my life at the age of eight of the first time.
8.0	I was wondering about what should I do with the money my parents gave me.
8.0	They told me to manage the amount of money and use them wisely.
8.0	I thought of a long time, finally decided to buy a birthday gift of my grandmother.
4.0	Although some people argued taht children are not mature to make their own decisions,it is still a very essential  experiense they have in their life.
10.0	No one will always make the right decision, children can learn form they dicision.
2.0	All in all, it is very improtant forr children to have the ability to make their own decisions.
3.0	Should parents offer their children in school money for each high grade they get?
12.0	I'll say yes and no, it really depends, and here's why.
12.0	Yes it could be a really good reward for children getting good grades.
8.0	It could be a really encouraging thing for children to work even harder.
8.0	Another huge benefit in ty opinion, is that this might help building up a sense of doing a real job for the children - you work harder, you get paid more.
8.0	I can still remember how hard I was studying before the tests every time since my mom would usually promise me to offer some money if I get a considerably good grades in unit tests back in my middle school days.
6.0	However, there are some potential disadvantages of paying money for good grades.
8.0	This might make kids studying just for the sake of money, instead of studying actually for getting more knowledge and preparing for their future - to put it simple, this may create a wrong value of study for them, especially when parents give their kids too much money.
8.0	In this case, kids might find a way to get around with it - they might do cheating around during the tests, copying others work just for getting good grades instead of actually study harder.
8.0	I saw quite a few classmate doing that at school before, and this is absolutely wrong, they're not only fooling their parents but also fooling themselves.
1.0	Which lead to the conclusion, rewarding for high grades could be good or bad, it really depends.
1.0	But in my opinion it's a good way to push children to study harder, but, again, it really needs further guidance from parents side.
10.0	"Children really shouldn't study just for the sake of physical rewards, parents should guide them to see the real spritual joy and meaning to their future of academic studies, offering money for good grades is just a little ""side boost""."
12.0	Educatioan as a hotly-discussed topic, there are many methods to help children improve themselves, as far as I am concerned, I disagree that parents reward their children get high mark.
6.0	Paents all hope their children can have a good grades, thus some parents may think give money to children could inspire them study, because when you have a gift that you want to get, you must try you best to get it.
8.0	But as we all know, it is vital to find children's creation and invention in their studies.
8.0	These two ability are important to their future's life, if one person were eqipped with two ability, he will find there are something more value than grades.
8.0	For instance, my brother whose study is well but his parents never give her any rewards, his parents always told him, you must find yourself in study process, don't pay a lot of attention on results.
8.0	I think it is yourself not other external things could help you success.
8.0	If you give money for each high mark, some students may have a immaturity opinion, they will focous more on their results, and in order to achieve their aims they might do something dangerous.
8.0	As good parents, we must cultivate chilren's good view to things, since parent's have a significant influence to their children.
3.0	Nowadays, with the quick pace of the televison developed, more and more companies try to have some advertisments on televison, which could make their commercial well known.
3.0	However, many people find that some advertisment like to use some young children.
11.0	Many people think it should not be allowed.
11.0	However, in my opinion, I think it is reasonable .
4.0	Firstly, children in age two to five can taste much fun in these experience.
8.0	Children in this age sometimes have nothing to do at home.
8.0	Maybe just play games with parents, or listen to some stories from parents.
8.0	However this experience can really add more fun to children.
8.0	They can meet more people, and do different things as usual.
8.0	To illustrate,when my cousin was 3 years old, she was told to advertise to a company.
8.0	When she done it all, she told her mother that she wanted to go there again, for it was so fun.
8.0	And those days she talked about that things nearly all days.
4.0	Secondly, children can benefits a lot from this experience.
8.0	If they don't have this experience, they can only know the  world they have seen.
8.0	Nevertheless, when they experience this, they can learn how to express themselves, and also they can have more confident to show themselves.
8.0	Take my sister as an example, she had that experience when she was 5, and she was more likely to show herself than the other children in her kindergarten.
8.0	From that experience, she knew the sweet taste after showing herself.
4.0	Admittedly, sometimes it can hurt the pure heart.
8.0	When the children have the advertisement.
8.0	They must be doing one things over and over again, for they are not mature as adult.
8.0	And sometimes, it can hurt them.
8.0	However, from my perspective, it is a experience they must get it through, and they can experience it earlier than peers, and they can be maturity earlier.
1.0	In light of these obovement reasons,  I think it should be allowed that the young children could attend to the advertising activities.
1.0	Moreover, I hope more and more young children could attend these activities, and there will be more
11.0	It is becoming an constanly growing need to find an effective way to make the best use of children's time while there parents are busy with.
12.0	to me, personally i would prefer to make create some output of the time instead of being wasted.
5.0	first, doing things with thier friends on schoolwork can cultivate children's various ability that equip them to be better adult in the future.
8.0	doing things together on something neccessary not only enable children to aquire better academic performence but also giving them real challenges to cope with.
8.0	for instance, when they are tempted to play games or other entertainment stuff, knowing that the group is having a goal, they will try to control themselves and this will result in the personality of self dicsplined.
8.0	in addition, since several children are together, they will learn to cooperate with each other, knowing how to get alomng with people.
5.0	second, through doing schoolwork, they can grasp a deeper understanding of the knowledge so pave the future career path.
8.0	this is because they will have more time exposed to the science and literature world, without the tempatatio  of other activities, maybe they will develop the interst to the subjects they are learing, with more time and effort put inside, they will lay the knowledge base more solid.
8.0	from my experience, many talented people i met are not aginst schoolwork, they kind of enjoy the learning and reading experience, maybe someone may find solving maths problems really fun, if he didnt put the time into it, he will never find it charming.
8.0	with his mah ability growijng, he may become a expert in financial field, may a great investor curiouys in numbers.
7.0	admitedly, children should be all rounded, there will bw side effect if one put all his time doig school
12.0	Recently, a controversial topic has aroused a debate among people: whether people should follow their dreams even if the dreams are ambitious.
11.0	Opinions vary from person to person.
12.0	Some claim that people should focus on achieving realistc dreams.
11.0	Nevertheless, contrary to their views comes to my perspective, it is following ambitious dreams that is more worth doing, especially when the following reasons are mentioned.
5.0	To begin with, following ambitious dreams can make us make more progress in our studying.
8.0	It is largely due to the fact that our ambitious dreams will be a guideline, which can give us scores of motivations.
8.0	In this case, we may have more energies.
8.0	Consequently, we can make more progress than others.
8.0	By contrast, had we did not had an ambitious dream to guide us, we would lost our ways.
8.0	Thus, studying cannot attract our interests.
8.0	How could we make more progress if we concentrate our attentions on studying?
8.0	For example, my friend Jack is a creative people.
8.0	He wants to be an expert in English.
8.0	Thus this goal always encourage him to step forward.
8.0	In this case, he ues all of his time to study English, like reciting, singing English songs and watching English movies.
8.0	Consequently, he get a huge progress and was admitted by an English language school.
5.0	On top of that, following ambitous dreams can make the country would be more strong.
8.0	The primary reason for this is that, if the teenagers both pursue their dreams, they would work for it and become specialists in their area, thus the country would be more strong.
8.0	For example, In USA, their children always follow thier heats, and most of them clearly know what they need to do.
8.0	Thus, they work for it, and thier ambitious dreams guide them to be experts in their areas.
8.0	Therefore, USA has diverse of experts, and their country becom strong.
2.0	To put into a nutshell, I reckon that we should follow our ambitious dreams.
12.0	Nowadays, a considerable number of people, holding the idea that people today are not as helpful as in the past, claim that people today are more selfish and only care about themselves.
11.0	However, I don't agree with their opinion.
11.0	From my perspective, people in our modern society are more willing to help others who are in trouble, and I will demonstrate the two reasons in the following contents.
4.0	There is no doubt that some people today are kind of selfish.
9.0	They only care about those things which they can benefit from, and, as a result, never cast a glance at people who are helpless.
9.0	In fact, it is the revealing of those people's actions that bring us the impression that people today are selfish.
4.0	However, the quantities of people who are willing to help others are by no means less than in the past.
8.0	Firstly, the main reason to support my opinion is that more people nowadays have the ability to help others.
8.0	As we know, people all over the world are becoming wealthier as the development of scientific and technological progress, and most of us don't need to struggle for live.
8.0	The expense of helping others become less a problem to us, so whem we find someone else around us is in trouble, we are mostly willing to give him a hand, while in the past, helping others might means having no money for food for a few days.
4.0	Another factor to support my opinion is that we have more chances to help other today.
8.0	As the development of television and Internet and many other media, we can easily know the news such as somewhere occurs an earthquake or other disasters and many people there are in the shortage of food to eat and tents to live.
8.0	As most of us are willing to show our sympathy, we would like to donate some money or some clothes for them.
8.0	For example, when we heard that an really shocking earthquake destroyed to areas in Sichuan, China several years ago, most people in my class choose to donate our pocket money for them.
8.0	However, in the past, without advanced Internet and Television technique, it may have been after several months before we finally heard the news, and we even don't have the chance to help others.
7.0	In a nutshell, what we have mentioned above, when taken together, are in favor of the point that people today are more willing to help strangers who are in struggle not only for the reason that we are more wealthy, but also
3.0	In most case,people would like to spend more time on movie or reading because they think people are supposed to enjoy their lives like that in such a advanced society.
11.0	I greatly disagree with the statement that it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing exercise.
4.0	First of all,the health decide whether a person are able to work or relax.
8.0	There is no doubt that take physical exercise is beneficial to people.
8.0	The more healthy people are,the more thing people can do.
8.0	Of course,it is also a good way to relax by reading or watching a movie but it might bring some bad influence to people,if they spend too much time on it.
4.0	Furthermore,it is easier to make people happy or outgoing to do physical exercise rather than watch a movie or read a book.
9.0	if you take exercise outside,you might meet more friends and meantime they would like to communicate to you,therefore you can expand your horizon and make your life more wonderful.
9.0	If you only stay at home for reading or movie,you will be lonely,because noboddy take to you.
4.0	Finally, you will be more mettlesome when you take exercise outside.
9.0	the exercise make you stronger and lucidum.
9.0	once you feel very mettlesome,you will be excited to do anything and it make you work better  than you did before.
2.0	To sum up,people are supposed to do more significative things to make lives better,therefore it is better to do physical exercise than spend time on book or movie.
3.0	Recently, a controversial topic has triggered a heated debate among people: whether people would spend less time cooking and preparing foods in 20 years than they do today.
3.0	Opinions vary from person to person.
3.0	Some claims that people would spend more time doing this.
12.0	Nevertheless, contrary to their opinions comes to my perspective, it is less time that would be spent by people to cook and prepare foods in 20 years, especially when the following reasons are mentioned.
5.0	To begin with, there would be more high technology cooking tools in 20 years, which would resulting people spend less time.
8.0	It is largely due to the fact that  in 20 years, there would be more high techology artificial tools.
8.0	Because of the convinient tools, it can largely shorten the cooking time.
8.0	Thus, people will spend less time.
8.0	By contrast, how could the time be saved if we only have the primitive cooking tools?
8.0	For example, when I was 10, I lived in the rural region with my grandparents, which only have the primitive cooking tools.
8.0	When we cooking meals, we would set fire and add the wood fuel to the fire.
8.0	It is very inconvinient.
5.0	On top of that, the public transportation would be developed better than now, which can also decrease the cooking and preparing time.
8.0	The primary reasons for this is that if we have a more convinient transportation, we can have more vehicle options.
8.0	In this case,we can choose a more swift vehicle to buy my vegetables.
8.0	Thus, we can save our preparing time.
8.0	On the contrary, if we have a not advanced transportation,  we could probably involed in a traffic jam.
8.0	How could we save our time if we waste too much time on the road?
8.0	For example, In my hometown, we have subways and swift buses and taxi.
8.0	Thus I can choose one of them to buy my food vegetables.
8.0	But what if am I in a countryside?
8.0	I can only choose to walk to prepare or ride my bike.
2.0	To put into a nutshell, I maintain that people will spend less time cooking and preparing foods in 20 years.
11.0	I do not think it's a good idea to reward children money for their high grades.
12.0	Because it's esay to corrusp their ideas on money, and may envoke their harvings for money.
11.0	What's worse, they may think their goals of study are money making rather than accumulating knowledge and ability growing.
11.0	That will change their meaning of study.
4.0	On the one hand, giving money to children for their good grades can totally affect their opinions towards money.
8.0	"They will ignore how difficult their parents earn money,and waste money aimlessly----for that they can ""earn"" money easily just by getting good grades."
8.0	One of my friends once told me that his parents gave him money to reward him for his good drades,and he bought lots of useless games, which was very bad to his study.
8.0	Soon he became less superior.
8.0	Besides, many classmates thought it was unfair that they didn't get extra money for the marks, and asked for that as well.
8.0	That was a disaster to all of our parents.
4.0	On the other hand,  children who receive huge amount of money don't have the ability to manage it well, and they will ask for more money, which is a terrible result.
8.0	Another classmate of mine also enjoyed this policy waste money on clothes,  make-ups and other meaningless things.
8.0	Once she ran out of her money, she would ask her parents for more extra money.
8.0	Hearing her promising another number one, her happy parents willingly gave her more money, which was soon sent to shopowner's hand.
4.0	What's more, this behavior creats a misleading idea----children think that they are making money by studying.
8.0	I am not against the Nobel Science Prize winners, but I have to claim that the aim of study is not money making, absolutely.
8.0	Now those children above mostly think their aim of studying is making money.
8.0	They forget why they entered a school, as well as why they are having a class.
8.0	The initial goal of their parents is to encourage their study, isn't it?
2.0	To som up, it's not a good idea.
3.0	In our contemporary era, where the intensity of competition has risen to dramatical proportion, there has emerged a number of big enterprises that have a huge influences on the society in many ways.
3.0	People are curious of how have such big enterprises started from zero and grown to what they are now.
3.0	The answer to the question is the people who founded those enterprises.
11.0	What they have in common is that they all have great leadership.
11.0	I disagree with the statement that leadership comes naturally:one cannot learn to be a leader for the following reasons.
5.0	Firstly, the majority of great leaders of great companies start from scratch, and in their early life they experienced difficult times and they manged to get through them.
9.0	It is the experience of early time suffering that makes them mature,which gives rise to their later success.
9.0	I do not believe that those leaders were born with leadership and my opinion is justified by the fact that not until in the middle or late age did some of  those leaders become successful, such as Larry Ellison, the founder of Oracles and Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, both of whom started their own business from their middle age.
5.0	Secondly, nowadays, there are a lot of leadership programs that aim to discover young talents and equip them with various leadership trainings for future use.
8.0	If those selected young talents were born with leadership,what is the point of launching such programs ?
8.0	why not just hire them ?
8.0	Moreover, During  leadership training process, young talents are often assigned tasks to complete and may be asked later to perform presentation to analyze what they have achieved through the given task and what improvements they should make in order to do a better job.
8.0	All of these things prove that leadership has to be trained.
0.0	To sum up, leadership is cultivated by combing practices with some theories.
0.0	Only by having plentiful experiences and  ups and downs can one truely realize what leadership really is.
0.0	Hence, it is fair to claim that leadership does not come naturally.
3.0	I don't think it's a good idea for parents to give money to their school-age children for each high grade they get in school, and here I'd like to present my opinions.
10.0	Firstlly, this behavior looks more like a trade between parents and children, which will make the child think he or she is studying for their parents, not themselves, it will make the child short-sees and will mix the true meaning of study.
5.0	Next, I don't think most children know how to use the money correctly.
9.0	They may use the money to do something bad, which can not be controlled by parents and may also be harmful to the children.
9.0	Knowing how to spend money is much more important than just having money.
5.0	Last but not the least, money is something too cold, it won't show any heat of parents to the child.
8.0	If the parents really want to award the children, I think instead of giving money, they can try some other things like a family trip, a visit to his or her dream university and so on.
8.0	These are something more meaningful which can also be a treasure memory.
8.0	I still remember I once got a good grade when I was a little girl, my parents took me to the local university, and I had a talk with the students there, which made me had a more specific plan of the future, and encouraged me a lot.
8.0	I can never forget the smilling face I had that day.
1.0	Above to all the reasons I have presented, I consistently believe that offerring money to school-age children for each high grade they get in school is not an appropriate behavior.
1.0	Children do need award for their excellent performance in school, but how to award is really a difficult thing that need parents to think carefully.
12.0	In my opinion,this is a good idea that parent give their school-age children money as presents for their high grade.
8.0	First,we should give them something when they get high grade with thier effort.
8.0	It is important to teach them that the gain of everything requires effort and if you spend time on something,you can really get a lot from what you do.
8.0	To give them some money represents that we encourage them to work hard and we like them to do it.
6.0	Second,there is no doubt that we should teach our kids how to use money early.
8.0	We will give them money to let them control without our command,so why not we teach them to control money earlier.
8.0	If we give them the money,they will know the power of money when they are young.
8.0	It is known that kids should learn to manage their money from childhood and then they would not waste money to do something bad.
8.0	We can give them some guidance to help them use the money they get,but we should not make decision for them,they should learn to make desition by themselves instead.
8.0	We can not forget that this is ou Finally,I want tosay that we can give them some money but we can not give them a lot of money.
8.0	They are school-age children without the ability to have too much money.
8.0	And we can not only give them money to praise their high grade.
8.0	We should always communicate with them and help them to know what they did is perfect and what they did should be improved.
3.0	Having a glimpse on whole socity, job is highly important for everyonw because it is essential part in our life.
3.0	What ability can help us reach our achievement on job?
3.0	The ability to adapt to new work environments or high degree of excellent knowledge for the job?
12.0	For me, I am keep tune that these two abilities have value on our future career's success.
5.0	In the first place, the ability to communicate with employees can help us obtain more opportunities.
8.0	For instance, my mother is a layer who has strong knowledge background on law.
8.0	However, she almostly could not get any case in the past because she was too shy to communicate with others, which made nobody know her and no one know her ability.
8.0	Gradually, my mom frequently attented her company's party and talk with her co-worker about some current popular law events, which leted this a new group embrace her.
8.0	Gradually, her boss learns her abiliy on law and introduce lots of cases to my mom.
8.0	According to my mom's ability to communicate with her co-workers and finally became a successful lawyer.
8.0	I learn that embracing professional knowledge is far not enough and the ability to adayp to new work environments have same priority as excellent knowledge for the job.
5.0	Secondly, the ability to adapt new job pattern is same important as high degree of excellent knowledge for the job.
8.0	For, example.
8.0	I work in a computer company after I graduate.
8.0	However, I can not adapt this work condition although I have excellent knowlegde on computer science since this company requests us work in high efficiency without any erros.
8.0	In this way, I always can not finish my work tasks because I have not been requested like this when I studied in university despit I have good knowledge for the job.
8.0	Furthermore, I find that some co-workers who knowledge for the job is weak but have high efficiency to work can get higher salary than me.
8.0	Therefore, I find that I need to adapt this higher work pattern and do not make mistakes rather than get stronger knowledge for this job if I want to make my future achievement.
2.0	To sum up, the abilites to adapt to new work environments such as commuinicating with others and adapting work strence are same imporant as high degree of excellent knowledge for the job.
3.0	"In recent ten years in China, from our media, we always can see the news on the website title which includes the word ""Peng Ci""."
3.0	"""Peng Ci"" is a fresh word created by our web."
12.0	It means that some strangers are pretending to have trouble and if some kind people to help them, they put all the wrong things on that person and ask for money.
11.0	After having seen these kind of news, people are becoming less likely to help the struggling person because they don't want to be in trouble.
11.0	Therefore, in my opinion, I disagree that people today are more willing to help the strangers in a help need.
12.0	The reasons are following;
4.0	Firstly, it is the trust between the helper and the trouble stranger.
8.0	The people who wants to help do not believe the strangers any more.
8.0	When they are in face of some one in trouble, the first thing they are  considering is whether the people is in fraud.
8.0	Then, they will be more likely to choose a protect way, which is,  ignoring it and quickly going away.
4.0	Secondly, the moral of people seems to decrease compare with the past.
10.0	People becomes more intelligent  but less friendly.
4.0	Thirdly, it is rules of our society.
8.0	The people who do the right thing may not gain what they should gain,such  as money or reputations.
8.0	It seems helping others has no benefit.
8.0	People all want to benefit themselves.
8.0	If there is no motivation to do the things, most of them will not choose to do.
0.0	However, there are still many people who are very gentle and generous and elegant.
0.0	They are advocating and leading common ones to fight with the evil ideas, to make our worlds more better.
0.0	They never mind whether or not they will be awarded.
0.0	They just do it.
0.0	Therefore, as a highly educated student, what we need to do is following thier feets and believe our kindness.
0.0	All in all, love can spread from every corner in the world by our kind behaviors.
11.0	Some parents may offer their school-aged children money if they get high grade.
11.0	They may consider it as an encouragement for their children and can inspire them to study harder.
11.0	But I don't think it's a good idea.
5.0	It's normal for parents to have a high expectation on their child.
8.0	But this is not a good way to encourage children.
8.0	Parents are likely to consider it a bargain with their children.
8.0	It works like a trade:the child get a high grade and the parent pay money for it.
8.0	Money can never be the only connection between parents and children.
8.0	This is not a good solution to the problem that children can not get high grade.
5.0	For a student,one can not make money a goal of studying.
8.0	If a student thinks that studying and getting good gardes is important,then he will try his best to study.
8.0	But if a student don't think it of any importance,the money will only be an attemption for him.
8.0	And there's possibility that he will cheat in exams in order to get the money.
8.0	A child may be not good at studying maths or physics but good at music or art,with this trade it'll only get him into extreme inconfidence,for he may never get the money no matter how he tries.
2.0	To encourage students,there are some better ways.
8.0	Parents could first find out what the child like and what he's good at.
8.0	Then help him determine what he would like to spend his time on.
8.0	Passion and hardwork comes from an ardent heart.
8.0	If a child is willing to do something ,he'll do better than if he's forced to do something.
8.0	Then both the parents and the student do not need to worry about money.
8.0	And the attitude of the parents is important,too.
7.0	Knowing that grade is not everthing can make
11.0	As the development of science and technology,children should know more about this world.
12.0	Some people think students need to do homework or partcipate in organized activities.
11.0	Some people think students need to do something they want to do.
11.0	In my opinion.
11.0	I think  students should do someting they really like.
10.0	Here are some reasons.
6.0	First,everyone has their own potential.
8.0	If students find something they really like,they will spend their time on it.
8.0	Do something they like will improve their efficiency.
8.0	For example,my sister don't like math ,she likes music very much.
8.0	She don't want to take math calsses because she's teacher does not like the student which has bad math score.
8.0	But she play instruments very well.
8.0	Everyone think she has potential in music.
8.0	And everyone think if she can         do what she really want like music,she will be a great musician.
1.0	Second,cultivate students do what they want that will let society have more professionals.
1.0	If schools and parents can make students do their want,the students will have more interest.
8.0	So they will study more harder,and when they grauated they will have good grades.
8.0	If every major have many good students.
8.0	It's a good thing for our society.
11.0	Some people hold the opinion that doing phsical exercise is better to relax than watching a movie or reading a book, but in my opinion,I think watching a movie or reading a book is better than doing physical exercise.
5.0	There are numerous reason that watching a movie or reading a book is better than doing physical exercise, and I'll just explain the most important reason in here.
9.0	Watching a movie or reading a book just need you to focus on that, you just need to use your mind and understand that.
9.0	It's will not consume your energy, many people like to take out a book when they're tired.
5.0	But it's not means doing phsical exercise is not useful.
10.0	Some students that are face on test, or other situation that let them feel press, or nervious, they will do some physical exercise, it's a good way to decrease pressure, and become relaxed.
7.0	Although doing physical exercise is very useful, compare with reading a ook or watching a movie is not
12.0	As the development of media and jouralism, people can know the events that happening  around the world everyday.
12.0	Some of the events may not relate to people's daily life, so a lot of people think it's a kind of waste of time to know these things.
12.0	To be honest, I used to have the same opinions as them but  I changed my mind after thinking twice.
5.0	Knowing the world news is a good way to make the world become more interesting for you, so you will have a better life if you have good passion to the world.
8.0	My uncle was a loser and he was depressed because of it.
8.0	The world was dark for him   in that he lost his wife and job when he was only 28 years old.
8.0	He couldn't find the sense of belonging even his other relatives were with him.
8.0	By a magical chance, he knew an organazation which is in order to provide  free education for the kids in some poor area in Africa, so he decided to go.
8.0	I'm not sure what were exactly happened in that place, but when he came back, he became a person that I used to know who is outgoing and loving the world.
8.0	Had he refused to know what happening at the other side of the earth, he couldn't find himself back.
5.0	It will also help you to widen your horizon.
8.0	You will get in touch with the things that are fresh new for you and you wil gain some new knowledge from it.
8.0	These new things will provide some surprise for you  at some time.
8.0	I attended an important interview in order to get into a good high school.
8.0	Before I went there, I just knew the crisis that happened in France from  the television.
8.0	The teacher who interviewed me was a French.
8.0	Before we finish, I express my sorror to his hometown.
8.0	He was surprised but feel moving from my words.
8.0	Finally, I got the offer from that school and had a new friends at the same time.
1.0	To be a teenager that keep the pace of times, it's very important to care about the world news.
1.0	According to these reasons,  i
11.0	I think it is not a good idea,it is too early for them to have such a number of money.
11.0	This would lead to the wasty in the future.
4.0	School-age children do not have the abiliity to get good use of their own money.
8.0	They may use them for criming and they just do not know.
8.0	I think unless they know the true use of money,parents do not need to give them the money out of their need.
8.0	Doing such behavior,children will not understand the difficulty of earing money,and they will not take good use of them.
8.0	They are just too young.
4.0	And they will not understand that do not show your money to others.
8.0	They may just put it in hands.
8.0	And every passer-by could see it.
8.0	In the addition,some crimer may want to hurt your child for their money,and they just give the criminal the money and still cannot feel there is something wrong.
8.0	They are easy-cheated,so maybe they have a high number of money but still do not know how to use them.
8.0	You give he these money,for hoping he could live better,but he may use the money on others.
4.0	Besides,they do not know each prices of each thing,they may buy a 100dollar apple and still feel happy,they may buy a 100dollar bread and feel exciting.
8.0	They may be cheated but they do not know.
8.0	But can you punish them?
8.0	No,this is your fault.
8.0	You just give them the money,but you do not teach them how to use.
8.0	This is a big fault on your home-education.
8.0	You should not give them the money.
8.0	You should take them to use it.
8.0	In this way,You can improve the love between you and your child,but also can teach them by yourself.
2.0	It is not a good idea to offer your school-age child for each high grade.
3.0	With the society development, social competition become more and more fierce.
11.0	many people want to be like others who are succeed.
12.0	However, I have a different idea.
11.0	I agree with the statement that people should be like differently from everybody else.
11.0	These are some reasons why I feel this way: it is difficult to exceed people who succeeded before.
4.0	First of all, in the old time, society had appear many successful people.
8.0	This lead to be more difficult success like them.
8.0	As my experience for example, my parents know some people study abroad that they all succeed finally, so my parents want me to study abroad.
8.0	However, they do not know that successful people are samll part of the studying abroad students, and they do not know that the competiton is fierce.
8.0	We have many successful example, we can not to beyond people who secceed in the old time.
8.0	We will have more problam which can make us give up.
4.0	In addition, people should try other way to succeed.
8.0	If you succeed by other ways what are different from everybody, you will beyond the other successful people.
8.0	This is because that you creat a new way to succeed.
8.0	Only different from others will get more attention.
8.0	If everyone becomes the same type of person, this society will become more boring.
4.0	Admittedly, becomeing like others will bring people easy to succeed, because this way has many people to guide.
10.0	However becomeing people what is different
1.0	In summary, in order to succeed, becoming the successful people what is different from everybody is better than become like others.
1.0	becoming different from others can make society more ways to success.
3.0	Whatever you work in a company or study in the university, friends always are essential ingredients in our life because they may bring us happiness, acadamic help or phycological help.
3.0	Which kind of friends are more important for us?
3.0	Friends who can make us happy or friends who can give us help?
11.0	In my opinion, I definetly keep tune that we are supposed to make friends who can give us help.
4.0	In the first place, friends who can give us academic help enable us have a good grade in university, which pave the cornerstone for our future success.
8.0	For instance, I always failed in chemistry in the high school because no one of my friends could give me help on this subject.
8.0	However, when I attented in the university, my best friend, Daniel who was a genius on chemistry always studies with me.
8.0	This way, when I could not understand some chemical reaction or laboratories , I could directly asked help from Daniel.
8.0	Then, he might send me his note book or explain the process for me.
8.0	Based on Danel's help, I figured out all problems in chemistry.
8.0	Finally, I got grade A in the final exam and got a massive scharlorship in mastery.
8.0	Therefore, making friends who can provide help to me never fail to create more opportunities for me in the future.
4.0	In the second place, to make friends who can communicate with us can help us escape from the daily grind.
8.0	I can use my brother',James, experience studying in America to illustrate this opinion.
8.0	When James studied in the university, he always felt nervous and could not sleep in the night because of the massive workload and frequent exams.
8.0	Luckly, later he met his best friend Jane.
8.0	Following, they always communicated with each other.
8.0	Jane sometimes talked some happy experience about travelling all of world and usually went to the movie theater with James.
8.0	Gradually, James felt happy and forget the negative events in life.
8.0	Jane's help solve my brother's phycological problems and help him embrace a happy life in the university.
8.0	Thus, it is highly important to make friends who can give you help.
4.0	However, some people claims that it is more important to make friends who can play with us and bring us happiness.
8.0	I totally disagree with this point owing to the fact these friends will only distract us from studying.
8.0	For instance, when I studies in high school, I always can not finish my homework because all of my friends were big fan of computer games and we always played computer all the time.
8.0	In this condition, although I felt happy, I got a bad grade on all subject.
8.0	Thus, in order to recover the enthusim for study, I never played with them.
8.0	After that, I falled in love with study again.
2.0	To sum up, it is highly important for us to make friends who can give you help on academic and physiology because we can get a good grade and physical healthy instead to make friends who can only have fun with us.
12.0	Nowadays, as the society steps forward, there is a controversial debate that whether people will take more time to cook and prepare foods in twenty years.
11.0	Many people agree that people in the future may spend less time.
11.0	After all, many people may become more busier in working.
11.0	However, in my opinion, cooking and preparing foods can cost more time in twenty years for these reasons.
5.0	Firstly, people will have more time to cook and select raw materials in twenty years.
8.0	This is because technology will be more advanced in the future, so many simple labor might be replaced by artificial intelligence.
8.0	In this situation, people don't need to waste time to repeat simple works.
8.0	So they can save time to cook and prepare ingredients for family.
8.0	For example, my cousin who works in Zhong Bai Supermarket used to have to count the income themsleves, but recently many new type equipments, which have function of automatic payment, occur in the Zhong Bai supermarket.
8.0	So what my cousin needs to do is focusing what kinds of the products is in short in the supermarket.
8.0	In this way, my cousin can finish his work ealier and have more time to consider what his dinner wiil be.
5.0	Secondly, people will concentrate more on the quality of healthy diet in the future, so they can select the foods material more carefully than today.
8.0	This is because people in the future can get more access to imformation of healthy diet, according to the smart phone or some advanced devices.
8.0	In this situation, they can read about healthy diet.
8.0	As a result, they know more about how to choose the most wholesome food sources.
8.0	For instance, there is an application called healthy diet in my mother's smart phone.
8.0	Everytime before she cooks, she will turn on the application to find out what kind of foods stirs together can offer the most nutritions for us.
8.0	In my opinion, this kind of application and promotes will be more in twenty years.
8.0	So more people will get these knowneladge.
8.0	Because thay know how to choose the best materials, so they can choose for a longer time.
2.0	So I disagree with this idea.
11.0	I agree with this statement.
11.0	Because knowing about events happening around the world can enrich my horizons and improve my overall personal qualities.
12.0	More importantly, I can embrace the culture and customs of many different regions.
5.0	The variety of things happening around the world has opened my eyes to a lot of new and interesting things.
8.0	Jordan's sea of death, for example, was particularly shocking to me.
8.0	The Dead Sea is the world's deepest saltwater lake and the most salty.
8.0	The sea, because of a special substance, allows people to float on the surface of the water and never sink.
8.0	This is one of the world's amazing discoveries.
8.0	If I didn't know what was going on around the world, I would not know there was such a magical ocean waiting for me to know.
8.0	How boring my life would be.
5.0	In addition, knowing things around the world also improves my overall personal qualities.
10.0	For me, personal comprehensive quality is essential in life experience.
2.0	Last but not least, understanding world events also allows me to accommodate many diverse cultural customs from different countries.
7.0	This will not
12.0	I think parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school is not good idea.
8.0	Because first at all resone,children through get high grade to make money to buy computer games or many food, it is not good to them healthy.
8.0	The second reason,if some family don't have enough money,chidren will get very sad and dispirited.
8.0	So we need to another way to award children.
8.0	Therefore,I think parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school is not good idea.
3.0	During the class or the meeting, if your teacher or leather help you correct your mistake, what should you do?
3.0	Will you choose to interrupt the class or the meeting and correct your mistake in advance?
3.0	Will you talk to your teacher or leader after the class or the meeting？
3.0	Or will you say nothing?
12.0	As a student like, I will chhose to waiting util all the students are gone and then ask for my teacher patiently, because this is a kind of respct to my classmates and teacher and I can get help from my teacher slowly in order to get more information.
5.0	Asking teacher after class in a way to respect our teachers and classmates.
8.0	If we correct our mistake right away, we will disturb our class.
8.0	Thus, not only the teacher's mind will be interrupted, but also have a giant influnce on our classmates' mind.
8.0	For example, one year ago.
8.0	I have experience a same circumstance.
8.0	But I did a really unwise choic.
8.0	I actually interuptted the class and debated with my teacher.
8.0	I thought I did not have fault, but my teacher thought I had a mistake.
8.0	So the whole class stopped continuing.
8.0	After this thing, I felt really guilty.
8.0	I didi not respect my teacher and even damaged the whole class.
8.0	So the first choic is really incorrect.
8.0	But, if we say noning, we will be regarded that we are indifferent to our teacher and do not willing to listen to our teache's advice.
8.0	It may cause a kind of misunderstaning and also not a respectful behavior to our teache.
5.0	Also, I can have more time disccuss with my teacher after the class.
8.0	If we do this on the class, we will only have a few minutes.
8.0	So do that after class is better.
8.0	Take myself as an exmple.
8.0	When I meet some difficult during the class I will take thoes questions in my mind or write on the paper.
8.0	And then I will ask the teacher when thay have some spare to help.
8.0	Therefore, I will have a deep discussion with my teacher.
8.0	And the effect is really obviouse.
8.0	My all questions will be solved, and I can also get some additional information.
8.0	And my scores are increased apparently in a few months.
8.0	So I will choose the middle one.
0.0	After all, waiting until the class is over , and then talk to the teacher is better.
0.0	Because it is considered as a repect to our teacher and we will get more information.
0.0	And we will not cause some misunderstanding.
12.0	In our socitey, people have to face tons of pressures ,especially the adults who take some hard jobs.
12.0	So ,finding a way to release the pressures is really urgent.
11.0	In my opinion,compares with watching moives or reading a book, doing physical exercise is a more suitable way to relax.
4.0	First of all, reading books or watching a movie may make you cultivate a bad habbit.
8.0	When you read or watching the moive, you may keep the same posture for a long time or even lay on your bed.
8.0	Which is not good for your heath and eyesight.
8.0	Though you may get some knowledge from the books or feel happy by watching moives ,you will soon become even more tired.
8.0	However, doing some exercises will keep you from the electronics and make you healthy.
4.0	Second , doing exercise is not only a way to relax.
8.0	It's proved to be a good way to be health.
8.0	Doing exercises really have  many advantages,such as keeping fit or concentraring at what the teachers say duing the class.
8.0	In addition, it can help us easier to fall asleep after doing some exercises, which is really good for our next day.
4.0	Futhermore, doing exercises can be a cheaper way to relax, even totally free.
8.0	As we all know ,books can be really expensive in some countries ,such as british, so it will cost a lot.
8.0	If you go to the cinema to watch a moive.
8.0	It's also very expensive.
8.0	But doing exercises can be really easy.
8.0	What you need is only a pair of shoes.
8.0	So it won't cost a lot.
7.0	In conclusion, it's obvious that doing exercises is a better way
11.0	I am extremly agree that people today are more willing to help the struggling strangers.
11.0	The topic attracted many person's attention because people today are more willing to help the struggling strangers.
6.0	In the past,some persons hold the view that ready to help others is the traditional virtue of China and we should help struggling strangers when they are in trouble.
8.0	However,there as well are some people who think that coming to struggling strangers' aid could cause great harm to ourselves and as a result of this, we shouldn't help strangers.
8.0	Despite these are facts, in my view, there is no doubt that we should help struggling strangers in good time.
8.0	All of us need a hand once sometimes, if we don't help others, how can expect others to help us.
8.0	So there is great need for us to help strangers who are in the soup.
8.0	Helping make the world more warming.
8.0	However, in order to avoid involving in unnecessary trouble when helping others, it would be better for us to choose a reasonable way.
8.0	For example, to help a child who was falling into river, seeking others' help rather than jumping into the river if you can not swim at all.
0.0	In a word,we should adhere to our moral code firmly.
0.0	And we should give aid to struggling strangers when they need help.
0.0	Let us make a imagine, what the world will be without helping struggling strangers.
0.0	It must be a disaster because none of us can sure that we won't need any help in the future.
0.0	Only in this way can our world become more harmonious.
11.0	I disagree with the statement, I think it is better to relax by doing physical exercise.
11.0	As the physical exercise can bring us more  First of all, when we are getting tired, your eyes as a part of our organs, may feel in the same way.
12.0	Watching movies or reading books will do  harm to our eye sights and will also intensify the pressure.
12.0	Doing physical exercise means to have a intimate contact with the natures, the wild and open space will increase our satisfictions and make us delightful as well.
12.0	Not only protect our eyes, but also provide a better relaxing environment instead of staying in a narrow room and face to the sceen or the lines.
5.0	Moreover, having exercise can simply release our depressed feelings.
8.0	While playing sports, especially for those which asked for more than one player.
8.0	For instance, during the competition, it draws all of the attention to focus on the game.
8.0	And if the game is connected with championship, then that will superinduce much more fun.
8.0	Futher more, when we are sweating or making efforts to challenge and to achieve, it motivates our sprits in various ways, such as shaing confidence, developing leadership etc.
8.0	But the most significant aspect is to jusify our busy lives and escape from all the sadness in order to become relaxed and comfortable.
5.0	Ultimately, doing physical exercise always requires to spend more time with each others, which probably makes it a more understanding and adorable neighborhood to live in.
8.0	On this view point, we can see that  more people and more communications are important because we live in the society that is built by human beings.
8.0	If so, the relaxations and our happiness should be tied tightly with others throughout daily conversations.
8.0	Having closer relations with different people will increasing trust and that is what reading and watching moveis lack of, for the real problems are in lives, but the true solutions are also hidden among complex relations by doing sports.
2.0	In short, I don't agree with the contention which aquired us to believe that watching movies or reading books will be a more efficient way to relax than doing outside sports,throughout my three points.
12.0	Recebtly, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people whether poeple should focus on achieving realistic goals.
11.0	Opinions vary from person to person.
11.0	Some people claims that people should not focus on achieving realistic goals.
11.0	However, I stand on their opposite side and I believe people should focus on achieving realistic goals.
11.0	I have some reasons to explain.
6.0	First of all, people focus on achieving realistic goals can acquire a easy process to success.
8.0	It is very real and help you know how to do.
8.0	you need not worry about your goals because you can look at success road so clearly.
8.0	In contrast, people do not have a wish to surpass themselves, maybe they will lose powers to do everything.
8.0	However, people can use some ways to increase their power and achiever their goals.
8.0	For example, my friend David like make a complex list to record everything he should do today.
8.0	this habit he insistsin six years.
8.0	When he finish one day, he will checks what things he does not do and finsh it.
8.0	And now, he is a perfect student in our class.
8.0	I believe that finish these small goals every also useful, David accumlates his hard and acquire success.
0.0	In addition, people focus on achieving realistic goals can make change in every time.
0.0	Everyone know this society always make some huge changes in short time.
0.0	people should find out what things they can do.
10.0	If we can focus on many small goals, then we canchange our future in a true direction.
7.0	For instance, a student used t
3.0	There are lots of people seeking for jobs,the question of how to get a great job and make it successfully has become a significant role of our lives.
3.0	Some people try to make many friends in order to get more convenience.
3.0	Some people just work hard· in school and do their best for the best grade.
3.0	Although making friends with various people from different fields is always regarded as a good way，I prefer to study hard in school to improve my studying abilities.
12.0	And here is my explanation.
6.0	Firstly,studying hard in school could help us to keep beneficial habits and characteristics.
9.0	to be honest,the days during school turely make me stressed out,but it sincerely makes me fullfilled.
9.0	In the last time of the my high school days,my hard working helped me improving my grade and also taught me a lesson that“If you persist，you will be succeed.’
7.0	Secondly，studying hard in school will give you some useful skills and experience which are meaningful for future
3.0	At present, some parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.
11.0	Some people think it will encourge their children to study harder.
11.0	At the point of view, I do not think it is a good idea for children.
4.0	Firstly, studying hard is duty for all of students.
8.0	As we all know, each of role has its duty.
8.0	Therefore a student, studying hard and completing homeword at time is normal.
8.0	For example, if I do not consentrate on what the teacher say in the class, the teacher may criticize me even tell this situation to my parents.
8.0	My bad behavior do not border the teacher.
8.0	But studying hard is a complusry for students.
4.0	What's more, offering money for high grade will let students forget why do they study.
8.0	As we all know, studyiing is not for our parents or teachers.
8.0	We are only responsible for ourselves.
8.0	If parents encourge their children in this way, it will do harm to them.
8.0	My brother is a bad example.
8.0	In order to get the reward his father offered to him, he even cheated in many exams.
8.0	Because the reward is attractive for him.
8.0	And he could buy his favorite game machine by using this reward.
8.0	Definitely, this condition is not  his father wants to see.
4.0	On the other hand, offering money will encourge children to pay more attention to study somehow.
9.0	However, the students who are study hard will still hold their good habit even without the reward.
9.0	As an old saying goes: things will develop in the opposite direction, when they go extreme.
1.0	To put it in a nutshell, offering their shcool-age chilrdren money for each high they get in school is not a good idea for their parents.
1.0	parents should pay more attention to developing their children a good studying habit, rather than offer reward.
3.0	Nowedays, people taking part in work is not only for making money, but also want to feel satisfied.
11.0	Different working tasks have differnt charming, people can according to finish diverse different task to get their satisfactory and attain the level that they want.
11.0	In my personaly, I think trying different tasks will get satisfactory easily than always do the same thing.
4.0	First, different works can teach us different abilities, so our scope of knowledge is enlarged, and we can use this knowledge in another aspect.
8.0	For example, when I was a little girl, my life is full of academic courses, I did have any hobbies or something that is attractive me.
8.0	Although I spend a lot of time on study, my grades is still not good.
8.0	One day, my mother want to help me change this situation, she find a teacher teach me piano.
8.0	When my teacher teaches me, she told me that the process of practicing is very boring, but if I can persist, I will have achievement in the end.
8.0	Then, I would spend a lot of time on practicing.
8.0	One day, I found the reason why I spend much time on studying but the grade is not good, that is I cannot concentrate on a course for a long time.
8.0	When I study one couse, I will think about that I need to finish homework of abother couse.
8.0	In the end, even I spend time on it, because my efficiency is very low, I still cannot make progess on it.
8.0	Then according to trying to do another thing, I undersand the importance of persistene and concentration.
8.0	Thus ,depending on this, I make progress on studying.
4.0	Second, when we try different things, our abilities will be exercised from different aspects.
8.0	It is beneficial for us to do another thing.
8.0	For example, in a company, some works usually finish their tasks and they would not do another thing.
8.0	Instead, some clerks will finish their task at the same time, they will do another things such as reading, or developing their hobby.
8.0	If one day, the company request the clerk to make a plan about a project.
8.0	These workers who just finish their own work, their mind would be limited, but for another clerk who like trying different things in a day, they can make this plan from differnt aspects.
8.0	In the end, without doubt, the boss would appreciate the plan from the second kinds of person.
8.0	Therefore, they can get reward from the superior office, they will develop this habit contineuly.
4.0	Finally, when we finish differnt tasks, we can get touch with different people ande can learn a lot from this person, when they get into touble, we can help them get rid of it.
7.0	So we can e
3.0	Teachers are always seen as the indispensible part in the society and they are regarded as the influential people who dedicate their lives to the education.
3.0	It seems that they should always been respected and appreciated, however, nowadays some people point out that teachers are no more that valued compared to the past.
11.0	I hold the same opinion.
5.0	To begin with, students no more appreciate the teacher's value that much for teachers are no more the only source from which students can get the information and knowledge.
8.0	In the past, without internet and higher educated parents, teachers are the main source for the students to get educated.
8.0	People's eagering to gain the knowledge made the teacher most valuable people in the society and help them gain a high social status.
8.0	Nevertheless, things change over years.
8.0	With the development of the society, students have more choices to gain the knowledge, they realize they can surf the internet for some specific and professional ideas or ask their highly educated parents for help.
8.0	Students' not relying on teachers make the teachers less important, thus leading to they are less likely to be appreciated and valued.
5.0	In addition, students now are more independant and comfident than before, making the moral regulations seems less important.
8.0	In the past, students were always taught by their parents to respect their teachers.
8.0	In their minds, it's more like a moral virtue,so they even regarded teachers as the authority, thinking everything they said were right.
8.0	But nowadays, the society become more open and there is less moral restriction between teachers and students.
8.0	Stuedents are allowed to discuss in the class, ask question right in class, and even point the mistakes of the teachers.
8.0	Some of the students even have a reverse mind, they deliberately disagree with teachers in class.
8.0	Without moral restrictions, teachers are no more a singal of authority, and of course they are not been valued like before anymore.
1.0	To sum up, the importance of the teachers differs as the time changes.
1.0	Although we have to admit that teachers still play an important role in the society, but it's obvious that they no more play a indispensible and necessary part as before.
3.0	Parents are always concerned about their children's studying performance as well as their grades in the school, therefore some parents wants to motivate children's studying by giving children's money if they can get the excellent grades.
3.0	People varying different backgrounds and cultures view the same issue from different angles and some parents may think that it will  bring any changes to children's grades through this way.
12.0	While personally, I I am inclined to claim that it is a wise idea that parents provides money to children as a award for getting a high grade.
5.0	To begin with, children will become more voluntary and active in studying if they get the monney rewards.
8.0	For parents, they need to encourage their children when they children get the achievement in school.
8.0	Alhough there are many ways to motivate children to get high grade in school like parents can buy some gifts to children, moeny always is the best way.
8.0	Children can use the money to buy something they want and they are more likely to achieve a high grade if they will get this rewards.
8.0	For example, my sister hated to study math and had no interestes in this subject when she was young.
8.0	My anut used the money as reward to arise my sister's interests on studying math.
8.0	Since my sister wanted to buy a doll and she tried to save the money for relaizing this goal.
8.0	Therefore, my sister had the goal and even she did not like math very much at the begining.
8.0	For getting moeny, she sudied hard and at last she saved enough money to buy the doll successfully.
8.0	At the same time, she received a higher grade on math she gradually had interetes on learnng math.
8.0	From this example, money can motivate children to study especailly when they feel no passion on somethings.
5.0	Furthermore, children can learn how to use the moeny and cultuivate their financial management thought if they get money from their parents.
9.0	The ability on how to manage moeny is important in future life, hence parents need to let children learn how to dominate their moeny.
9.0	If children have their own moeny, they will form the ability to control abd mannage their moeny.
10.0	To sum up, parents can use
3.0	The public casts strong interests on personal working experiences, along with work has become a common topic in modern society.
3.0	The increasing concerns over what sort of work people are busied with in their working time has brought about a heated discussion on their working preference to variety of tasks or the similar works in their workday.
12.0	Some hold the opinion that the former makes more sense, for the reason that it can refresh the worker's mind, and provide them with more opportunities to learn in their position.
12.0	However, in my opinion, similar tasks make expertise and gurantee the high effeicency of work.
10.0	The reasons are illustrated below.
4.0	Firstly, expertise always concentrates on one specific filed no matter it refers to study or work.
9.0	If you want to make yourself outstanding in your position, the only way to prove yourself is to make contribution and devotion to it, rather than show how proficeiency you are at printing and speaking if you are an editor, or how excellent you are at making excel, word or powerpoint if you are a salesman.
9.0	A variety of work will destroy the growing time for the worker in this position, in another word, it is a waste of time for expertise.
4.0	Secondly, high effieciency is essential for a company to promote and develop.
8.0	There is no doubt that the more a person concentrates on his business, the higher the efficency will be.
8.0	On the contrary, a person with a variety of tasks can hardly focuses on his work, he will be disturbed now and then if he has to handle different type of tasks in workday.
8.0	And ultimately, he finishes all things in hand with no gurantee on high quality and high effeciency.
8.0	Clear define on the duties of defferent position is necessary, and that is also the reason for workers to choose their occupation carefully, that this the way for them to accomplish their value.
4.0	I have to admit various tasks can also cultivate a person's muti-task ability, but it is hard for the work to grow and promote in a company, because they cannot concentrate on their own work, which means they donot have enough time to learn what they want.
2.0	In summary, employees are pleased to do similar tasks all day long for this is how they make themselves expertises in their filed and how they can realize their self-value in the society, even though a variety of tasks can help them refreshed from all-day similar task.
12.0	Nowadays,  more and more work require their employees to be well-round.
12.0	For the company, they wish that their employees not only  are proficient to skills, but also have a leadship.
12.0	But how can people be leadship?
11.0	Some people think people can learn to be  a leader, but the others believe leadship comes naturally.
12.0	As far as I was concerned, people can learn it.
6.0	Firstly,  leadship is a ability  which we can learn from other people.
8.0	In my opinion, leadship means people can organize other people.
8.0	Maybe some people said they do not how to do that or no one teaches them how to do that.
8.0	But I think that is because they  never observe how other people do that.
8.0	For example, when I was in middle school, I was minitor of my class.
8.0	At the began, no one followed my instructions.
8.0	Also, when I organized a meeting, there were less people attending.
8.0	I was so upset that I even planed to give up.
8.0	But my farther told me hold on and told me what I should do.
8.0	He told me I should make rules about meeting and I should be willing to talk to my classmates.
8.0	And finally, they said I was best minitor they ever had.
8.0	No one is born with knowing everything.
8.0	It is common for us not to know how to be a lead at the begin.
8.0	However, the most important thing is we need to learn from ohter people.
0.0	Secondly, leadship is a ability which people can pratices.
0.0	For everything, the most difficult part is the beginning.
0.0	And as for leader, even if we know how to be  it,  but that does not mean we can be.
8.0	It needs us to practices.
8.0	For example, my cousin was  a managemet of his company, because his parents were leader.
8.0	So he knew how to do that.
8.0	But in the first day, a few people followed him, even if his instruction was pretty good.
8.0	And after going home, he pracaticed a lot how to be a leader.
7.0	Severl month late, he was one of best leader of company
7.0	So i t
3.0	In nowadays, the technology developed rapidly, so there are more and more employment demand.
11.0	the benefits  of the ability to relate well to people can be explained by analyze how it can help us to make more friends, learn things more easier or get more happiness.
5.0	So I agree with this statement.
8.0	Firstly, in a unfamiliar environment, if one people can relate well with others, they can get more firend.
8.0	there is an example of my sister.
8.0	She is 20 years old now.
8.0	When she was a child, she used to be silent and she was not good at communicationg with others.
8.0	At that time, she only studied at her room, and she did not play with others outside.
8.0	Certaintly, she had good grades.
8.0	However so many years after, she became more and more outgoing.
8.0	The boss in the company likes her charactristic, and she found a good job there.
8.0	She also made a lot of friend.
5.0	Secondly, if one person is good at commuicate with others, this person can learn things or solve the problems easier than the people who only study hard by themselves.
8.0	Once my father told me something about one his colleague.
8.0	He is very shy and he does not like to bother others.
8.0	If he have some problems, he seldom asks others and spend a long time on solving it by himself.
0.0	Thirdly, if someone who is good at chating with others, they can get more happiness.
0.0	One of my friend, who is silent and bashful.
0.0	If she has something very sad, she never tell others.
9.0	She always be unhappy.
9.0	Soon after, she is offcolor.
7.0	and always makes mista
12.0	I don`t think giving money for high grade is a good idea.
12.0	First of all, learning is not just for money.
10.0	For example,Madame Curie,the famous scientist,refused the huge amount of money people offered to get her patent of purifying radium but permitted people to use it freely so human-beings around the world can benefit from it.
6.0	Then,to give children in school-ages a lot of money is possibly harmful.
8.0	Children's self control is lower than adults`.
8.0	They may use the money unproperly.
8.0	One of my classmates,used his scholar to buy an iPhone 6S when he was Grade 3,then got a very low mark in university entrance exam.
8.0	What a tragedy.
1.0	What`s more,personally speaking,I hate to contect knowledge to money.
1.0	In my idea,Knowledge is something holy,that we should keep it pure.
10.0	After all,study should be disinterestedness.
3.0	Nowadays some parents offer their school-age children money each high grade they get in school ,it is supported and against by many people .
11.0	and I disagree with it .
4.0	To begin with , if students just study for money , that means if they don't get any money on studying ,they will maybe stop studying .
9.0	The motive of working hard is just money ,this will give children faluse opinion about the relationship between money and study .
9.0	If a study- for -money student grow up and they will may got no opinion about moral snd health because only thing they cared is money.
4.0	Secondly , offer money for each high grade to the students bring money problem to the family .
9.0	If students keep getting good grade on simple classes and the parents still keep giving ,the outcome of the family is going to be big and may let some parents cannot afford ,but if the parents stop giving money ,the students will stop working hard .
9.0	This will sure bring family into problems .
4.0	Thirdly ,there is sure big effect on students if parents offer money for their school- age students for each high grade they get at school .
8.0	Reward sure bring incentive to the children .
8.0	Everybody working got incentive from money ,and this is going to let the childrens grade become higher and higer ,.
8.0	But the negetive side is really bad ,childrens will become too thirsty for money and it isn't a good thing for sure .
8.0	although parents see good grades ,it is not worthy to sacrifice childrens's pure .
2.0	Because this way has too many negetive sides ,I think offer children money for each high grade thry get in schoolis not a good idea.
3.0	Recently, there is a heated discussion regarding whether parents should not help their children when they make errors and make them learn  lesson from the errors.
3.0	However, the common phonomenon is that  the number of parents prefer to spoil their kids and try their best to help them figure out every problem so they will compelet project without making mistakes.
3.0	On the contrary, I disagree with them.
12.0	My view will be explained bu analyzing the following reasons.
5.0	One reason why I support  my  perspective is that chirldren are able to be indenpendent without relying  on their parents' assist.
8.0	This is because when they find there is nobody else can help them except themslves, they will be more concentrated in doing their works although they may make errors, in this process, they can learn how to finish the work quikly while they are doing the projects.
8.0	Therefore, they can be independent.
8.0	For exmple, my little brother, he always asks my mother for help with his assignment because he is afraid of making the mistakes.
8.0	However, when my mother eventually decieds not to help him any more, my brother has to do the homework himself.
8.0	Now, he is get used of this,and he can finish his work efficiently and accurately.
5.0	Another relevant reason used to support my opinion is that chilrden can be able to aviod making the same mistake when their parents make them work alone.
8.0	This is because they have experienced the mistakes himself, they can remember them instead of kowing nothing when others help them to do.
8.0	For example, I always let my mother help me clean the room,one day she is not at home so I must do that on my own.
8.0	Howver, I put everything in the wrong place so I can not find them next day.
7.0	Bu now ,I will not do so
3.0	For this statement, I strongly disagree with it.
3.0	In my opintion, the children in the past did not have many digital facilities to play, but they were more likly for them to go outside which is still tough to educate.
3.0	Besides,nowadays not every parents have much money to buy a electronic phone for their kids, so there arenot too many these situations.
11.0	Although, some might say wathing colorful screem is harmful for children's eyes.
12.0	In this case, out door activity was much more dangerous and difficult for parents to control.
5.0	To begin with, some kids could only go to out side to play with other kids in the past few decades, which means they might be caught by some bad guys, so this is a big problem for old citixen to conduct.
8.0	As you know, many parents in the past were buzy about their heavy workload, so they had not much time to look at the the children.
8.0	Compared to this circumstance, nowadays children just play the computer games in the room, so there is no life threasting event to occur.
8.0	The mom or dad just need to look at their kids a few times in several hours to gurantee they are safe.
8.0	In conclusion, oarents reakky had difficulty to take care their kids in the past.
5.0	In addition, each cell phone or other electronic things are money consuming, parents will not easily spent too much money on a game playing facility.
8.0	Like I said, if you are parents, who earned a little money per mounth, so will you want to buy a gaming facility for your kids to play every day?
8.0	Of course not.
8.0	Every wants their children to work hard on studing, and they can totally buy a cell phone for their kids which just can communicate with others.
8.0	Thus, it seems nowadays the parents are easy to teach their children.
7.0	in conclusion, I prefer reconmend that the parents can not
11.0	I don't think that is a good idea.
5.0	There are two reasons.
8.0	First,the main thing in school is learning,there are few places to spend money.
8.0	If parents give students a lot of money,it is  easy to distract them.
8.0	They usually take more money to do other things,this is bad for learning.
8.0	Second,it might cause children have Bandwagon Effect they will compare their shoes,bag and so on.
8.0	it's not only have harmful for their of psychology,but also give them an incorrect view of money.
5.0	In general,offering large of money for school-age children is meaningless.
8.0	It is a harmful and unbeneficial act.
8.0	It will have a very bad impact on children.
8.0	Therefore，in my opinion,some parents should not offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.
3.0	In the modern society, more and more young people begin to decide everything by themselves.
3.0	They make the decision without asking the opinion form others.
11.0	So I agree with the idea that young people depended too much on their parents to make decisons for them in the past, and  today young people are better able to make decison about their own life.
5.0	First of all, with the appearence of internet.
8.0	Young people have more access to information.
8.0	And such a large quantity of information make it possible for young people to make decisions about their own lives by themselves.
8.0	For instance, in the past, if a young person need to choose a job and wanted to know something about a career.
8.0	There was almost no way for them to obtain information about the career.
8.0	He could only ask the people neraby for help, like asking their friends for help.
8.0	However, most of time limited information could be found by this way, because the people nearby are very likely to know nothing about the career,  just like young person.
8.0	Under such a circumstance, following their parents' suggestion is the best choice, since their parents were more experienced.
8.0	Following the decision made  by their parents  might lead to a better consequence.
8.0	However, in the modern society, with the appearence of internet, this problem doesn't exist anymore.
8.0	Young people can easily get the information they need from the internet.
8.0	With the ample supply of information, they can really think things through and make decsion by themselve.
8.0	They needn't to depend on their parents because of their lack of information.
5.0	Secondly, , due to the improvement of education system, young people get well education and become mature in a younger age than before.
8.0	The large quantity of knowledge obtained in the school allow young people to make decision by themselve.
8.0	In the past, the school only taught their students math,english, or other acdamic courses.
8.0	Nevertheless,beyond these subjects ,the modern school also teach things like attitude toward life, the desigation of life.
7.0	From things mentioned above, I hold the opinion that today young people
12.0	I disagree this statement.
12.0	the reasons why I think it’s better to relax ourselves by exercising than by watching a movie or reading are as follows.
12.0	To begin with.
12.0	it's very important to keep in good health.
12.0	So exeercising is surely the best way to stay healthy.
8.0	And in the other hand,with the technology advancing,we can watch many exciting movies.
8.0	It's not very fresh any more.
8.0	but sports is different.
8.0	we can enjoy our growth and prograss by sweating.
8.0	what's more?
8.0	whenever you do some exercise you can get a whole new feeling thourgh your body.
8.0	For example going out to play ball games,which is becoming more and more popular,can get rid of bad moods and help you become energenic again.
8.0	besides,compared with reading and watching movie,doing exercising is more benificial to our eyes.
2.0	So from my perspective，we should do more exercise to relax ourselves.
10.0	It's do helpful for our health.
3.0	It is generally accepted that parents worrying about children'grades too much will cause gigantic conflict and alieantion of this relationship.
3.0	Parents value their own children most,and children also rely on parents very much.
3.0	Parent-child relationship should be mutual benifit for both side.
3.0	However,many parents hold that in terms of higher marks of childeren,they will give children money as bonus,or,there will be punishment if their is a decrease.
3.0	Recently there is a heated discussion on whether parents should encourage their children's study by offering money when they perform better in academic.
11.0	From my perspective,on the one hand,it is relatively a fabulous idea,on the other hand,it is the worst.
5.0	When it comes to greater marks acquisition in exams,it is determined by students themselves.
8.0	If the student is industrious and intelligent,views study as a genuinely interesting habit,then it will be uncessary for parents solely encourage them by what they really want,rather than money.
8.0	This type of students,eager to get out of their comfort zone,ambitious to achieve something great,money will not satisfy their demand,but knowledge will.
8.0	Also,if money is an avaliable answer for what they need,it will be a great motivate.
5.0	However,there appear another different type of students,which in require some kind of encouragement such as money.
9.0	Without money as motivation,they lack the goal of studying more,and after taking exams,it will be rather confusing for them to carry on.
9.0	As for them,it might as well a good solution to offer money in the purpose of pushing them forward and working even harder.
1.0	To sum up,the way of encouragement should be carefully chosen,depending on the student himself,not only judged by money.
1.0	Parents should also care less about the grades of their children,for what they crave is the tenderness of parents' love,not the cold material thing.
12.0	I agree that cars will became fewer in twenty years.
5.0	On the one hand, the new energy were found gradually by goverment.
8.0	As every one knows that if you want to make the car run, you should coast gasoline.
8.0	But do you know gasoline was made from oil which is non-renewable.
8.0	but the new energy is reproducible such as electric energy which can waged by a windmill or solar energy which only need sun shine.
5.0	One the other hand, the idea of saving energy is in many younger people' s mind.
9.0	The education became more perfect.
9.0	When people was a kid their teachers and parents will tell them to  economize the natural resources.
2.0	Although it is very important in our life that  cars can make transport more convenient, but the car is the source of environment pollution.
7.0	People can ride bike or take subway to
11.0	I don't think it is a good idea.
12.0	Because maybe some parents think it is a useful way to encourage their school-age children to get a good grades next time.
12.0	But these parents ignore that their children will think they study and get good grades for money not for themselves.
12.0	Since that,children work hard to get good grades for money in a bad circumstance.
11.0	They think that they will have money if they have high grades.
11.0	And then,they don't want to expect a better grade.
10.0	And this bad circumstance result in thier grades which are not so good but reach the standard that children can get  the money.
5.0	Our life is a long journey.
8.0	The meaning of our life is the most important.
8.0	If we study for money,we will gradually consider money as the meaning of our life.
8.0	For example,a child get money from his parents for his good grades and when he grows up,maybe he will do many things for money.
8.0	But several years later,he must feel very tired because he lives as if he is the slave of money.
8.0	And he will lose heart because he has not the plan and aim for his life when he was a child.
8.0	So I think it makes children not comprehense thier meaning of their life.
5.0	Also,if some parents want to encourage their children to get a good grades, they have many choices to raise their children.
8.0	For example,they can tell thier children that they studying hard and getting good grades are not for other people ,but for themselves.
8.0	They should get good grades and work hard because it is for thier future.
8.0	And the prize for thier grades is not necessary because it is thier duty to make themselves stronger and more excellent.
1.0	I don't think giving money for children's good marks is a good idea.
1.0	Because they live for themselves.
12.0	When confronted with distress from the life,every individual have his own preferrence for relaxing himself,such as watching films,reading books and doing exercise etc.
11.0	From my perspective,as a way of relax,doing physical exercise is better than watching a movie or reading a book.
6.0	First of all,doing exercise can inspantaneously alleviate your stress from all aspects of life.
8.0	Just take an instance,When you are jogging,your sweat is dropping whereby you find what confused or depressed you for a long time is not that troubling.
8.0	Those living species,like the brooming flowers,are really enjoyable,and everything seems so nice.
8.0	Besides,it can also build up your body.
8.0	It is only by doing exercise that we can keep our bodies healthy.
8.0	If we don't have a strong and healthy body how can we cope with all the difficult tasks and live on by challenge ourselves?
8.0	Thus,doing exercise really means to every of us.
8.0	Last but not least,during all sorts of exercising we can feel the true wrold,such as the smell of the flower,the song of the birds, the color of the sky.
8.0	The time when you feel those tend to be tiny and neglective things we can cherish our lives and our mother earth.
7.0	To sum up,It can be convincingly proved that doing exercise really do good to our lives and is better than merely reading books or watching films inside the houselet's Doing more exercise
3.0	With the remarkable process of society, there are plenty of ways in communication.
3.0	Thus, a controversial topic has aroused: which is a better wayfor colleahues or classmate to communicate.
3.0	Some claim that communicating in person better because the face to face communication is more genuious.
3.0	However, contrary to their view comes my perspective that the communication through emails taks precedance.
12.0	My point is well elaborated as follows.
6.0	To begin with, it is the Internet that provide us with a lot convenience, especially in the communication ways.
8.0	To elaborate, as we all know, the most important thing both in works and study is to be efficient, which is affectly directly by the communication ways.
8.0	Under the assitance of Internet, it is easy for people to transfer workfile or information to their partners at any place and at any time.
8.0	Therefore, people can deal with problem and discuss with partner freely.
8.0	However, without the emails, people have to connect with their classmates first and neogiate the place and time to face, which is a waste of time.
8.0	For example, everytime my professor assigns groupworks, our teammates just use emails to transfer the data and discuss about the topic at our own home.
8.0	Therefore, we don't need to waste time finding a quiet place, wait for every teammate showing up and constantly stop to think new idea.
8.0	Just stay at home or library and send every research and ideas through email on a time, everything will be coped with efficiently.
1.0	In addition, only when people send the emails to communicate others can they guarantee that they don't disturb others.
1.0	To illustrate, given that different people have different schedules, if people phone their partner to talk about the place to meet it may interupt others' plan.
10.0	Therefore, it is hard for people to find a suitable time and place to communicate in person.
7.0	For example, when doing the project, I would like to find information at night but my roomate prefer to do it at nigh
3.0	Offering money to school-age children for each high grade they get in school is definitely wrong.
12.0	When students get used to this,they form the habit that they only do their best when their parents promise to reward them with money.
12.0	In another word,they are studying for money and their parents.
9.0	Students are actually miserable in this circumstance,because if they can't  get a high credit,they will usually get angry with themselves.
9.0	they can't feel happiness in studying,but become the slave of a test score.
6.0	so,what is a better way to reward children getting a high grade?
8.0	First the students have to know they are studing for themselves.
8.0	Knowledge you obtained from school is all for their future use.
8.0	If someday they are lost in the wood,they can use the knowledge they learned from their science course             to find the way home.
8.0	They can use what they've learned to solve the problem in a future carreer.
12.0	Nowdays ,there is a common idea that children can get money for each high grade they get in school.
12.0	Besides, many parents consider it as a good way to implove the child's garde.
11.0	As far as i am concerned, i view it as a grade opinion.
5.0	When the topic comes into my first eyes, i think those parent have a briliant mind to come up with this idea.
8.0	Giving thier children money if they get high grade in the school can effevtively promote the children's grade.
8.0	Not only can promote the children's grade, but also childre can have money to buy some books to make their study better.
8.0	In the modren life, some people think parents should not give their children money only becouse their children get high grade in the school.
8.0	In the old-fashion thought, they look money as a corruption,the thing which can corrupt the children's mind.
8.0	I can not agree this idea absolutely.
8.0	Every coin has two side and we ought to make full use of the good side.
8.0	If someone look at the other side constantly, he will always think it totally wrong.
8.0	To us,we should understand this method clearly and have an idea of the two side of the method.
8.0	If we can do this,we will consider it as a wise idea.
5.0	It is easy to come into a conclusion.
8.0	In my opinion, parents'method just like a courage-punish rule.
8.0	Every child wants the money, so they have to study harder than others to get the higer grade.
8.0	Therefore, child gets the hige grade and this can make child and thier parent both they want.
8.0	Children want money, parent want children have a great grades.
8.0	This way create a double-win situation.
1.0	Above the illustration,that is what i want to express.
1.0	Last but not least, whether children can get money or not ,they also should study hard to pay back their parents and their country.
3.0	As is shown as a matter of fact that work is an important element exist in our study life.
3.0	whether working together or just work alone has been a topic issue of public interest and concern.
11.0	Frankly spealing,the former standpoint,i believe,is more acceptable,especially when the following reasons rae considered.
4.0	Firstly,it will extand our knowledge edge.
10.0	The primary reason is that group work can learn something from others,more specifically,during the talking with other people,it can learn the way they work with problem,it can be a really good thing.
4.0	As an academic survey in the England inducates that 87.9% of the people who have been worked with others indicated that they really learn knowledges or just the good ability their companies face with problem,it really means a lots to them.
10.0	AS the example clearly shows that group work will bring lots of good things to everyone in it.
4.0	Secondly,group work can make friends.
8.0	Explicitly,in the proup we have many chance to communicate with people who you may never talk bofore.
8.0	Maybe i have a pertinneht example.
8.0	Last year,i worked in a group to in order to give teacher a computer project.
8.0	At first,i wrer weak about it,but fortunnately,my classmate Tom taught me some skills on the project working sometimes,and then i could do the things well than before.
8.0	Aslo,he become my really nice friend.
1.0	Thirdly,gruop work will save more time,If we only work alone,the things can be really difficuit for one,it not a good chioce.
1.0	in a word,working
3.0	At present, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among the students: is the ability to maintain friendship with a small number of people more important than the ability to have new friends easily.
3.0	Answers vary from one to another.
3.0	Some people claim that the ability to make new friends is of great importance.
11.0	However, contrary to their views comes my own perspective that the ability to maintain friendship is more critical and this ability can definitely decides our happiness.
11.0	My point of view is based on the following reasons.
5.0	At first, those persons with whom people choose to maintain friendship must be someone important to people, which can definitely decide people's mood and temper.
8.0	To be more specific, the reason why we always choose to have a long-term relationship with a paticular group of people is that  we see them important for they have a good understanding of what we like and dislike.
8.0	Since both sides know each other better, people can get along easily and enjoyably.
8.0	For example, Amy is my classmate of high school.
8.0	Unlike other classmates who don't contact me any more after graduation, Amy has still kept touch with me after college since we all totally knew each other.
8.0	I like strawberries while Amy likes mangos.
8.0	We know the advantages and disadvantages of both sides so there is always harmonious atmosphere among us. ,On the other hand,when it comes to making new friends, it's hard to have such nice experience since people don't have a good understanding.
5.0	Admittedly, the ability of making friends  easily is important as well for it could enlarge our social network and then broaden our horizon.
8.0	However, this ability cannot bring longlasting happiness to people because all of these new friends are just casual acquaintances.
8.0	People don't have a deep understanding with them, which means that they don't share common interest and hobby.
8.0	It's difficult to generate pleasure between each other.
2.0	In conclusion, the ability to maintain friendship with a small group of people seems to be more important than that of making new friends.
11.0	With the development of society, people always argue whether the young people should make their life well planned and well organized.
11.0	Some people might say we only live for once, so just enjoy the life we have and do not think too much.
11.0	Others might say young people must gain the ability to make a plan and organize his or her life.
11.0	As far as I am concerned, I agree with the latter.
4.0	First, young people should make a plan for their study.
8.0	As a young student, Learning to organize his or her study objects is essential because that is the most efficient way to improve their academic performance.
8.0	For instance, my cousin is resourceful, however, he is lazy and does not plan for his study.
8.0	There is one time he needs to prepare his final tests, but he merely plays the videos games and let the time goes by.
8.0	He at the end fails in that test.
8.0	He regrets for what his behavior and the next final test he makes his review plan and follow his plan, he gradually won the first place.
4.0	Second, young people should have the ability to organize in order to show the leadership impact to gain more oppotunity.
8.0	Without the oeganization, the people will not be gathered like the sandstone in the beach.
8.0	And if you have the ability to organize  scores of people you might have more chances to succeed.
8.0	For instance, my mom once was only a normal student in her class.
8.0	One day his teacher had to chose a monitor in her class.
8.0	And a lot of people decided to run the election.
8.0	The assignment the techer gave was to decorate the whole class.
8.0	Every body except my mom chose to decorate by themselves, and my mom, she chose to have dozens of people to clean the class first, and have the rest of the people to paint the blackboard and  put some decoration on every person's desks.
8.0	The teacher saw what my mom did, and in the end she chose my mom to be the monitor.
8.0	The ability of organization will kame you unique among the ordinary people and will let you have more chances to succeed.
4.0	I admit some people might say it is also good to live right now and enjoy the life we have.
8.0	However.
8.0	I would like to say the good life you have is only temporary if you do not prepare for the rainning day.
8.0	The preparation is the prerequisite for good life.
8.0	So the ability of plan and organization is critcal for the young.
2.0	To conclude, the young people must learn to plan and organize.
11.0	There are a large number of people who are content not to know what is happening in the world around them .
11.0	But since we live in the mordern age of globalization ,and the fact that we are so intensely connected with each one makes it imperative  that people should grasp events even if they are not related with their daily life.
4.0	Given the fact that the entire world's economy is connected,events in another parts of the world can affect those in other parts of the planet.
8.0	So many many people's financial condition are connected to events that are happening in other places .
8.0	One obvious example is the price of the oil .
8.0	Since much of it comes from the Middle East,people need to pay attention to what is happening in that turbulent territory.
8.0	If  the price of gas rises there,the prices of many more goods will also increase.
8.0	Keeping an eye on world events  ensures thata person will be prepared for such changes.
4.0	People also needs to be on the lookout for negative factors like the spreading of diseases globally.
8.0	Because of the higher incidence of travel ,people need to be aware of what illnesses are spreading throughout the world.
8.0	For instance,the SARS virus spread the to all parts of the world and kiiled thousands of people before it was vanished.
8.0	People must know about these kinds of events so that they can avoid travelling and being affected with these virus.
4.0	Finally,more and more people are moving to different areas around the world today,which requires them to keep informed abot what is going on many places.
8.0	They need to know about the security leve of the the places where they might be moving   or their friends and family are living.
8.0	For my aunt's instance,she moved to Europe recently,so now i keep track of the news to make sure everything is fine in her new home.
8.0	With families and friends spread out all over the world,events in other places can affect many people.
1.0	In summary,it is  crucial that people keep infomed of the events because they can exert an influence to people's finances ,health,and even their safety.
1.0	We are truly living  in a global community,so we cannot afford to be isolated from one another.
11.0	Some parents might argue that since they have experienced much things, knowing right from wrong, they should tell their kids what they should do to prevent them from making mistakes.
11.0	However, if we view their point from a different perspective, we can find that they oversimplified the real situations.
12.0	Therefore in my opinion, I am in complete aggreement over the idea that parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.
5.0	First of all, it's impossible to protect kids from making mistakes completely.
8.0	For one thing, children are curious about the colorful world in which we live and they are eager to explore it themselves.
8.0	When something draws their attention too much, they are likely to search for it without parents' permission.
8.0	In this situation, they may find out something exciting or make a mistake.
8.0	Also, it's too hard for children to remember everything parents told them.
8.0	On the contrary, if they make their own mistakes, usually they will not forget them and not likely to do what they did again.
5.0	Secondly, parents' experiences may not be still right as time goes by.
8.0	When parents were still teenagers decades ago, what they saw was not the same as what we learn today.
8.0	Something that were considered right may not be the correct choice any more.
8.0	Moreover, even if there are certain things we still hold on to, we cannot be in the exactly same situation with our parents.
8.0	I know a guy whose father was good at playing tennis but didn't turn professional because he wanted to go to college, and that's a decision made his father regretful for a lifetime.
8.0	When it was his turn to make his own choice, his father strongly suggested him to be a professional player.
8.0	However, even though he also played tennis, he wasn't so good at it.
8.0	He didn't listen to his father and went to college.
8.0	Not only did he did really well in college, but he is really happy he made the right choice.
8.0	After all, experience may not always tell you the right thing to do.
1.0	In summary, so eagerly may some parents want to protect their children from mistakes, it's not possible.
1.0	Children may not always listen to them; children may forget what their parents told them; children may do something ahead of their parents' permission; and parents' experience may not help their children.
7.0	So I think parents should just let children make their own mistakes and let them learn fro
12.0	Some people argue as if parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.
11.0	In my opinion, I do agree with this.
12.0	From my point of view, not only children, every people will make mistakes in their life, only if we know why we made those mistakes and learn how to motify them, we can be better than before.
12.0	Some people might argue that parents should tell children everything and help them avoid making mistake.
12.0	Still, I have two reasons to support my opinion in the following passage.
6.0	To begin with, parents can't live with us forever, we have to find the way to make less mistakes.
8.0	I remember when I was a kid, my mom told me that the first time you make a mistake, it is normal, the second time you make the same mistake, you have to ask yourself why you did it again, but the third time you make this mistake again, you'd better be careful.
8.0	This warning let me know that, making mistakes is a very usual thing, we can learn from it and don't make it again next time, also  we can avoid making this kind of mistakes after.
8.0	However, if our parents told us this kind of things is wrong, we may not remember it well and probably make this kind of mistake next time.
1.0	Furthermore, mistakes are like challenges in our life, the more risks we overcomes, the stronger we will be.
1.0	I believe that this is a common theory that almost everybaody ca understand.
8.0	Mistakes are like risks, when we dare of it, we choose to stop challenge it, then we will never progress and keep what we like in the rest of our life.
8.0	But when we try to find how to overcome those problems by ourselves, without anyone's help, we will learn more about our disadvantages and that we still need to improve.
8.0	This will help children grow quicker and stronger, also more meaningful.
3.0	In the contemporary society, leaders such as managers, generals and presidents play pivotal roles in the stability and prosperity of institutes that they are responsible of.
3.0	Most individuals, since they are youngsters, hope to be in the glory of leaderships.
3.0	Parents and teachers are also encouraging children and students to become a leader.
11.0	Someone believes that the ability to become a leader cannot be acquired and they come naturally.
10.0	However, through learning and practicing, everyone is capable of becoming a leader.
5.0	First things first, leadership requires various fields of knowledge.
8.0	In order to become a qualified leader, not only does a person need to master the professional skills in the field he is managing, but also he requires the ability of interpersonal communication and cooperation.
8.0	Those skills can only be acquired by learning from parents and academic institutions.
8.0	A example of my friend Wesley well exemplifies my opinion.
8.0	When Wesley was in his adolescence, he was already the leader of the musical band of high school.
8.0	Since he was four years old, he had already started to learn various musical instruments such as piano, violin and drums.
8.0	Besides his maturity in musical skills, he also learned how to deliver his opinions and has won first prize of the national speech contest for high school students.
8.0	All those acquired skills made him possible to become the leadership of the band.
5.0	In addition, a robust leadership also demands continuous learning.
8.0	Since the society never ceases to become more advanced, one needs to keep learning to keep pace with the modern world.
8.0	If a leader is proud of his power and never learn new things, he will be unable to notice the changes of the society and finally be substituted by the people who uninterruptedly acquired new knowledges.
8.0	For example, one of my friend Johnson is the leader of a financial company, Yellow River Securities.
8.0	Even he has become the leader of the data analytics department, he keeps learning new data mining techniques and amendment of the security laws.
8.0	"""If I don't learn new things, others will replace me."" said Johnson."
8.0	Therefore, it is essential for leaders to keep acquiring new things.
3.0	Nowadays, people always have many different explain to a same problem.
11.0	Here is a question that whether people should follow their dreams even if the dreams are ambitions,or they choose focus.
11.0	Many people beleve their judge, they think that people should follow their dreams.
11.0	However, I have owner mind and against their point, I believe that people should focus.
11.0	I have some reasons to explain my point of view.
6.0	First of all, people focus their dreams can achieve their dreams more easy.
8.0	people should know what they do or not.
8.0	They can do some thing they can do and increase their experience, when they insist these things long time, maybe they can finish their ambitions dreams.
8.0	In contrast, if people choose follow their dreams even if the dreams are ambitions, they have big percentage to fail and acquire nothing.
8.0	when people fail their ambition dreams, they probably stop their level and lose their vapor.
8.0	For example my uncle David was a basic employer in a smal company he did not competition some big company's job.
8.0	He insist his work about ten years and have numerous experience for his work.
8.0	It make his manager and boss all believe it and help him to be  this company's CEO at now.
0.0	In addition, people focus their dreams can make more free time to communicate with other people, such as parents, friends and some one help you.
0.0	Every one should have enough time to manage owner life, focus freams help people talk with other people in free time.
0.0	It can help people remain a happiness mood to receive their future.
0.0	In contrast, following ambition dreams will comsume much time and inflence people's normal life, it is not a good choose for normal people.
10.0	No one want to be a work machine.
7.0	A good example is my friend Sam, he really want to be a boss in a big company, in order to this idea, he hard to
12.0	Talking about this topic, some people prefer the job have a wide assortment of tasks which can satisfy their various demand, while other people think they can get a lot by repeating the work they do.
12.0	As for me, I don't agree this statement adn I prefer to do similar tasks all day long.
4.0	First, according to a report of people, the one is specific in one field always can get a higher salary than a person who is general in many areas.
8.0	The higher salary, the more satisfaction.
8.0	With more mone, we can buy some nice clothes, and go on a trip with our friends.
8.0	Considering that, we can get motivation to work hard.
8.0	After all, our purpose to work is to earn a living.
4.0	Additionally, repeating can help me be skilled in one field and get achievement.
8.0	When we repeat a task again and again, we can be skilled in this.
8.0	Then we can do it better and better.
8.0	Take Kobe for example, to be outstanding, he practices everyday for basketball.
8.0	He shoots the ball 1000 times a day, and he have done this for 20 years.
8.0	Once a reporter asked him why he was so successful.
8.0	And he asked, have you ever seen the scene of Los Angeles.
8.0	And now, he have retired and it's time to enjoy the life remained.
8.0	Heard about that, I drowned in a deep reflection.
4.0	Finally, I don't think doing many differents types of task means it's interesting.
8.0	In most cases, we are all faced with easy, boring work which means you can be replaced by others easily.
8.0	In the future, some workers who are doing some easy work can be given up and these work will be done by mechines.
8.0	Through this process, I don't think the workers will satisfy when they are faced will unemployment.
1.0	Taking into account all the factors mentioned above, we could easily draw the conclusion that doing similar tasks all day long can satisfied us more.
1.0	Maybe in the future when it's time for me to find a job, that will be a principle to select which I will take.
3.0	As I see it, offering money for high grade children get in schools is not a responsible way for their chidren.
3.0	I didn't deny the fact that this way can sitimulate students to study  in order to get better grades.
12.0	But essentially, it is a exam-oriented  representation and it can guide the children to the wrong direction.
4.0	First of all, the most important thing we should get from school is the development of our all-round abilities,but not the grades.
9.0	So this way to offer money will contribute to a student who can only get good grades while do nonthing in the other ways.
9.0	The only way to develop our abilities is to find out our interest and run for it.
4.0	In addition,these parents get the wrong understanding of study.
8.0	Students study for their own abilities and not for money.
8.0	If every parent administer this method,we can't image what the school and even society will be like.
8.0	In that world ,every student is crazy for money.
8.0	Not only can't the stdents  learn what they are supposed to contain,but also it have a huge and bad impact on the future of the children, contributing a less-strong country.
4.0	Besides,money need s to be used in right places where can support the family or learn more thing.
9.0	While using money in such way is an obvious behavouir to waste.
9.0	Money is suppoesd to have a push to the development of education,but it may be used in the oppisite way when be used in these parent's way.
10.0	What's worse,this
12.0	Can you imagine what things would like to be if you do not have any extended family members?
12.0	Have you ever thought the situation that you are watching others playing and enjoy with their cousins but you just feel like lonely?
12.0	Both of these answers must be not cool at all.
12.0	It will be a disaster if we have no extended family members, and you will have a think that extended family is really crucial for us after listening my stories.
6.0	Few things could be more terrible than having no extended family members.
7.0	Simply because
11.0	I do not agree that the opinions of celebrities are more important to younger than they are to older.
12.0	Inversely,I think different people can get various useful share of celebrities.
4.0	Firstly,older people themselves still listen to celebrities.
8.0	As we may think,older people always find little interests in their lives,but they still spend much time watching TV and reading newspaper.
8.0	If asked,the older people will talk about the recent news they heard in the reports and what the actors said in the TV series they liked.
8.0	It means that older people are still obtaining information from celebrities via different ways,so the opinions from them are also important to older people.
8.0	That can also explain why many TV talk shows still use older reporters who are more convincing to older people.
4.0	Secondly,the information itself has significant influence on older people,too.
8.0	As mentioned below,older people obtain information from newspaper and TV reports and series every day,they likewise inform their own opinions in the process like most younger people do.
8.0	In another words,there is no much difference for younger people and older people when understanding and digest information.
8.0	"If the celebrities care little about how their words will effect older people,like saying that ""seize the opportunities or you will be old"",that may have negative influences on older people."
4.0	Thirdly,it is also important for older celebrities to represent and speak for older people.
8.0	For many older people,they prefer listening to some older idols of them because they can learn from them about how old people can improve lives and be a positive model to younger people.
8.0	Older people still need advices of orientation of lives like younger people,therefore they believe in some famous people and choose to support their opinions.
8.0	Younger people mighy not think those word are useful,but older people will find them meaningful.
2.0	In a word,we can not ignore the importance of opinions of celebrities on older people,as we getting older,we will have different needs of convincing opinions from those when we are young.
11.0	I partly agree with the statement.
12.0	The first of all,it's more memorable for everyone including the kids if we experience something terrible which results from the mistakes we've made in the flesh.
11.0	It's much more effective and vivid than just hearing from the parents.
5.0	Besides,the mistakes are necessary in children's lives.
8.0	Lives without mistakes are not complete,they may get really puzzled when they grow up,making many serious mistakes.
8.0	They will probably be overconfident,too.
8.0	Also.
8.0	making mistakes plays an important role in children's personality buiding.
8.0	Only in this way can children realize they are not the center of the world.
8.0	Having made some mistakes,children will probably be more humble and willing to learn from and listen to others,especially their parents and other people with abundant life experience.
5.0	However,it doesn't mean that parents should let children do anything without giving them advice before.
9.0	Children are lack of the ability to understanding the world,they are in need of wise suggestions.
9.0	The cost will be too high if parents let children gain life experience completely by themselves,which may result in many bad situation.
1.0	To conclude,I think parents should keep balance.
1.0	On one hand,let children make mistakes sometimes,on the other hand,give them enough suggestions to avoid unnessary mistakes.
3.0	Nowadays yooung people have less connection with their communities since we can usually find the young people hanging out and having fun instead of taking care of the elders in communities.
3.0	And the neighborhood may just say hello when they meet each othre since they don't interact much.
12.0	Also, the community services such as help cleaning the gardens or watering the flowers in communnity are so considerable that the young people don't need to advocte enough time for the communities.
12.0	So from these phenomene we can know that young people surely spend less time on communities.
5.0	First, the young people have so many things to compete that they cannot spare some time on sommunity.
8.0	For example, a student in our high school need to preview the books and prepare for the next stage of the required expriement.
8.0	On weekends, they still need to take some extra courses which was arranged by their parents to get good grades in the final exams.
8.0	Once they have time, they want to have some pleasure such as playing computer games or going for a movie, which are the things they want to do instead of helping communities, because helping communities is so boring when compared with their entertainment.
5.0	Second, the relationship between youngsters and the communities is becoming weaker and weaker since they don't interact enough with the communities.
8.0	They may just say hello when they meet each other and then do nothing else.
8.0	Untill now I even cannot remember the family whose house is next ours.
8.0	The most embarrasing event is that when the community is hloding some activity I even can not recognize the neighborhood family when we were divided into the same group because the conditions are the same as that in the past.
8.0	We have nothing to share with neighborhood or don't want to share with them.
8.0	We even won't provide help when we are taking care of our garden and finding that the neighborhood's garden need some care.
8.0	That could be one of the reasons why we are not spending enough time in communities.
1.0	Last, the comapny who offer community service are so many and so considerante for the people in communities that we even don't need to do something for our community.
1.0	For an instance,  the family may call the nursery to send some helpers to take care of the elders in the family if the elders are too old to finish things for themselves, rather than let the students help with the elders becaues the company proviede some advanced and better service than the young people, so they may prefer the compang instead of the young people.
3.0	Sometimes,the parents offer the money to their children when the child got a high grade,the money is used for an award.
11.0	But I don't think it's a great idea.
11.0	I think that the way of award is more than one,the money maybe is a choice,but there are many better ways.
10.0	For example,the parents can buy something which their children is really like directly,they can also make a plan for traveling,it's also a very good way to award their children.
6.0	Offer the school-children money for award can also cause some other problems.
8.0	On the one hand,If the children don't know how to save money in their daliylife,they will spend money lavishly,and they will easily become run out of money.
8.0	On the other hand,the children maybe use the money in a wrong way.
8.0	It's also a bad news for parents.
10.0	so I don
11.0	First,I should say that I don't agree with the statement,that is to say,I think people today are less willing to help the struggling strangers.
11.0	To be honest,people today all have their own disturbing problems,as a song said:life is a struggle,in this case,people may have less willing to spend their time on others' bussiness,especially strangers.
12.0	What's more,as the frauds apear nowadays,it seems hard for people to trust strangers' words,including their statements about their so called struggles.
12.0	It's just a tendency of the lost of trust in society.
5.0	"For example,there are lots of poor beggers on the streets who wants little money from the passers-by,for us,the beggers are definately strangers,as we know,only a few people will ""give a hand"" to these poors,because many of the passers-by don't believe the beggers are truely poor."
9.0	As we know,some so called beggers are just pretending their disability,and some of them even look begging as their job.
9.0	It's just heart-breaking for those who are deceived,and that is why more and more people choose to ingnore the beggers on the street,or ignore the strangers' struggles.
5.0	However,if things become more apparent,I think there will be more people to trust and help the strangers.
10.0	Because it is easy for us to think what will do if our friends or families getting into trouble,if we know more about the stiuation,we may help others more often.
2.0	In a word,it is loss of trust and lack of time that leads to the unwillingness to help struggling strangers.
9.0	In this case,we should make it clear that what is more important for us,and try our best to know the things we have doubts,and to spread the trust spirit.
9.0	only in this way can the society become more harmony.
3.0	Some parents offer their children money for the high grade they get in school.
11.0	I think this is a bad idea.
11.0	It is bad fo children's growth.
5.0	It will let children study fo money.
8.0	Studying is the most important part in children's life.
8.0	If they study for money,they will lose many things duing studying.
8.0	They couldn't find their interest in learning.
8.0	The result isn't the most important thing ,the pocess is more impotant than the result.
8.0	So parents shuoldn't give their kids money for each high grade they get in school.
5.0	It may let childen believe that money is principal thing in life.
8.0	The reward should be vaiety.
8.0	If always use money for reward,money will play a bad part in childen's heart.
8.0	So parents should use vaiety reward to encourage school-age childen.
8.0	Money isn't a good prize.
1.0	Offer children money for each high grade they get isn't a nice idea.
1.0	Parents shuold offer vaiety reward to encourage children studying hard.
3.0	Whether it is more important for governments to spend money to improve Internet access than to improve public transportation?
3.0	"As a saying goes "" different strokes fro different folks""."
11.0	Some people may consider that improving public transportation is more necessary since it is inextricately related to our daily life.
12.0	However, I have a different standpoint.
4.0	Firstly, some people in rurals desire to acquire Internet more than convenient transportation.
8.0	On the Internet, people can know the outside world, and they can receive similar education as urban people.
8.0	Many students in rural cannot afford the tuition fee to study in urban area even though they have convenient tranportation to arrive at urban area.
8.0	Their parents need to put in great effort to offer a chance to their kids to go to school.
8.0	However, when those people have easier access to the Internet, they can connect to the computer of excellent school.
8.0	So it is conveinent for them to receive education.
4.0	In addition, people in urban areas also need easier access than public transportation.
8.0	Since increasing people are hectic nowadays, they need to connect to the Internet almost every seconds for their work or study.
8.0	Even though the public transportation is not so convenient, like people may face every day traffic jams.
8.0	They can utilize the time in the public transportation to read books or work.
8.0	However, if there are few Internet access, people may have nothing to do sometimes, but they always cannot finish their work in working hours.
4.0	Granted, improving public transportation is directly influence our life, since we need trafic transportation to go to our destination every day.
8.0	However, more and more people nowadays prefer to go to school or their companies by car.
8.0	Since people nowadays have wealthier life than people in the past,  they can afford the car.
8.0	Moreover, people can stop their car wherever they want, so even though governments invest money to improve public transportation, many people could not feel it.
8.0	However, it is now the Internet age that almost everybody can enjoy the ameliorate of Internet access.
2.0	Therefore, it is more important for government to spend money to improve Internet access than to improve public transportation.
11.0	I do agree with this statement .
12.0	Belows are two aspects in which i can prove my point.
11.0	First, the ability of dealing with mistakes is significant to children.
12.0	Compared with telling them what they can't do,leting them make mistakes can not only teach them how to avoid but also deal with such mistakes.
12.0	I am also in the point that it is a more effective way to teach a child by leting him or her make mistakes and face to the mistakes.
11.0	As we all acknowledge we will be more memorable to control some bad situation if we have met it before.
10.0	After making mistakes, we can truly face the mistakes and we will have an opportunity to feel the mistakes we have made completely, which will also be not only more clear but more considerable.
6.0	Second, everyone will make mistakes, besides parents.
8.0	So it is unable and impossible to porce chidren to be always correct.
8.0	Just as the ancient saying, teaching somebody how to fish is better than giving somebody fish.
8.0	It will also be more useful to let them make mistakes and learn from their own mistakes.
1.0	Third,by making mistakes children can also recognize how the mistakes are made.
1.0	These are all my self perspectives which might be something not reasoned enough.
3.0	Recently, an interesting question has aroused among public: teachers should be paid at least as much as doctors, lawyers or business leaders are paid.
3.0	Some people think teachers' salaries should be lower than other occupations.
12.0	However, I claim that teachers should be paid at least the same.
4.0	Primarily, teachers are allocated at the one of most improtant position, education.
8.0	Their job is to cultivate elites for different fields in society so that country is developed rapidly by them.
8.0	This is a very hard job because teachers should be the elites in teaching so they have to learn how to teach at first and they should also be professional in their teaching area.
8.0	For example, my phsics professor is a famous scientist who publish a book and so that he can be the phsics professor and he also cultivates a lots of good graduate students.
4.0	Additionally, teachers put very large efforts in every student so their efforts should be paid.
8.0	In order to cultivate students into best students, teachers are supposed to pay a large amount of attention into every students they teached.
8.0	Therefore, their big efforts should have the same return.
8.0	For example, my math teacher is a hard-working woman, she tried to increase our math grades to the first so she sacrifices her lunch break time to help those students who are poor in math and their grades increase apprently.
4.0	Granted, some people state that it's easier to be a teacher than be a lawyer or doctor.
9.0	Nonetheless, some teacher like film production professor, they have to be the on-the-job director which means they have to work as well as teach.
9.0	They need not only the license of teacher but also the work license and they should be fine to manage their time on whether teaching or working.
2.0	In conclusion, according to the importance of teacher's job and efforts they put into their responsibility, teachers should be paid at least the same as doctors, lawyers or business leaders are paid.
3.0	Have you ever seen the dim haze around the sky in your city?
3.0	Do you need to go out with a repirator every day?
3.0	As a normal civic live in our city, I abhor to see these phenomenons that cause of the exhausted gas from the cars.
11.0	So from my perspective, it will definitely be fewer cars in use than there are today.
6.0	On the one hand, the awareness of environmental protection enable us to pay attention to the air pollution.
8.0	To be more convincible, the increasing number of people know that it is a good way to control the air pollution together by reducing the number of cars.
8.0	Consider a advanced city Wuhan in our country for instance, the wise governments in Wuhan awared the significance about the environmental protection fewer years ago, and it attempt to control the emission load that from the cars by some traffic restriction, likes the cars that  license plate number are odd number are only allowed to drive in the odd numbers day, vice versa.
8.0	Obviously, some of the advanced city aware the significance of enviornmental protection, so it will be fewer cars in the future.
10.0	On the other hand,
3.0	There is no denying that we have been overwhelmed by all knids of tasks everyday, including those from work, family and even hobbies.
3.0	Consequently, it is not uncommon to see numerous people are still talking on phones talking about official affairs on their way or busy typing on laptops in subway.
3.0	Can they handle everything smoothly and successfully?
3.0	The answer is obscured.
11.0	In my view, even though our life have been stuffed with various things, it is still possible to perform some specific ones quite well.
4.0	The first reason is that most of adults have beared in mind that the most important things deserve the most energy and attention.
8.0	It means that faced with multifarious tasks, we are still supposed to focus on those which is crucial at the present.
8.0	For instance, when I was a high student, my hobbies involved playing piano, watch Japanese cartoons, and cylcling with friends on weekends.
8.0	Despite the fact that my schedule was always filled with diverse activities, I was still sure that my first priority was study in order to get the admission of my dream school.
8.0	And fortunately, the outcome was as expected since I knew what counts most in my life.
4.0	Furthermore, pursuing different things does not necessarily interfere with our main task.
8.0	Instead, we can achieve a relaxing mood or reach an energetic condition in order to concentrate on things we are most supposed to do well with higher efficiency.
8.0	My father is a vivid illustrations, whose major is civil engineer and works at a construction company.
8.0	At the same time, he still runs a small motel near a hot spring.
8.0	His colleagues even doubted whether he can cope with two careers smoothly.
8.0	However, my father once told me that when he stepped into the hot spring, his tiredness and pressure got in his company had all gone, watching his satisfactory customers and enjoying the gradifying warm water.
4.0	Last but not least, different trails are extremely essential to find our genuine interests.
8.0	Especially for teenagers at my age, it is quite difficult for us to decide which occupation we should take in our later life.
8.0	As for me, the most effective way is to try as much as part-time jobs as possible.
8.0	By working as a wraiter in a Chinese restaurant, a private math tutor of a middle student, a temporary clerk in a hostle, and a voluntary guide for our campus,  it came to me that the most apporiate job for me is to become a teacher since I enjoyed most as a tutor.
8.0	In other words, the purpose of having different employment is to find my true love.
2.0	In conclusion, people can still do what they want well even though they have to handle different task at the same time.
3.0	With the development of the quality of people's life, more kinds of working schedules are created.
3.0	Some peole choose to work five days for shorter hours so that they can have spare time everyday.
3.0	Neverthless, I prefer to work only three days for long time.
12.0	The reason is that I can have lots of time to explore my hobbies and also ensure the quality of my work.
4.0	The main reason why I prefer to work for long time is that there is more time left.
8.0	In this case, I can have more time to do things that I am interested in such as watching movies and going shopping,and also have a long break.
8.0	For example, my cousin Linda works for three days a week but she probably stay up late everynight in order to finish her assignment.
8.0	And after that she has four days to relax.
8.0	Linda loves travelling so she will take a small trip to some surrounding towns to explore other costoms.
8.0	This is pretty awsome because she not only makes her work down but also travels to other places.
8.0	If she selects to work five days a week for shorter time, she will not have enough time to travel.
4.0	Another reason is that, working for a long time can make sure the quality of finished work.
8.0	Some people prefer to finish their assignment for a long time and only work a part of it everyday.
8.0	But every time we begin to work, we need time to review what we have down yesterday and come up with how to continue today.
8.0	It is kind of wasting time and cannot finish the work with high quality.
4.0	However, working for a long time is harmful for our health.
8.0	But in the other hand, we have more time to release our pressure and relaxing.
8.0	Since we can get up late for more days, stay in bed and watch videos for a long time and also go shopping for a whole day.
8.0	In my point of view, we can have enough rest if we choose to work three days for a long time.
1.0	All in all, working three days for long hours is more enjoyable than working five days for short time.
1.0	We can have more time to relax and also finish the work with high quality.
8.0	it is widely acknowledge that as a significant compnent of daily life, the relaxation ,which relate to the quality of our life ,deserve to be better by watching relate to the quality of our life ,deserve to be better by watching a movie or reading a book.
8.0	However, considering a large number of people warking indoors without taking exercise,some individules oppose that will be better to relax by doing physical exercise.
8.0	Nevertheless,as far as i considered,it is better to relax by doing physical exerceseMyareguements are listed as follow.
10.0	first of all we can appreciate the scenery in the movies and experience the story in the books to relax themselves.
3.0	From my perspective, and combined with my own childhood , I agree the statement above very much and my reasons are following below.
3.0	Growing children have little life experience and know little about principles of life.
3.0	Therefore, during the time children grow up, mistakes are unavoidable for sure.
8.0	No parents can prevrnt their child from making small mistakes or big mistakes.
3.0	Also, blaming children for their firsrt-made mistakes is meaningless.
8.0	And that is the reason parents should let their children make mistakes.
8.0	But on the opposite, parents should not let the mistakes pass through very easily and rapidly.
8.0	Mistakes are valuable, even for adults.
8.0	Parents should catch the chance of their children's mistakes and let children learn from it.
6.0	Children learn principles and experience from two ways.
8.0	One is that parents and other adults teach them or tell them.
8.0	This kind of method is rather fast but less effective.
8.0	Children only know what you tell them but may not apply them in their real life or not understand how they should do when facing a problem.
8.0	In brief, this method is less efficient.
8.0	Another way is to catch children's mistakes and lead them to learning from their own mistakes.
8.0	In this case, they will tell right from wrong and do the correct thing the next time they face a same situation.
8.0	That is because they know the principles from their own expriences and they are clear about the results of their own mistakes that will obviously help them avoid mistakes.
10.0	As is mentioned above, I agree with the stat
12.0	It might be difficult for some parents to allowed their children to make mistakes, because most of parents want to try their best to protect their childrenfrom everything that might be hurt them.
12.0	However, in my opinion, in some conditions, no matter how much parents want to protect their childern and help them far from mistakes, it is better for parents to let the kids go and just watching them how to make the mistakes and solve their problems.
5.0	First of all, troubles and mistakes can be the best lesson for a children's growth.
8.0	Chidren will learn a lot about how to solve the problem and not make the same mistake next time.
8.0	If they make some mistakes by themselves, this experience will remains in their brains and leaving a lasting impression, so they will make better decision at the next time and avoid making the same mistakes.
8.0	For instance, one day when I was at the middle school, I forget to bring my homework to school, which needed to be handled at that day.
8.0	I should have asked my mother to bring it to school for me, but she refused and ask me to remember not forget to bring my homework next time.
8.0	I was criticized by my teacher, but it impressed me alot and I'll never forget to take the homework next time.
5.0	Secondly, it might be the best way for children to try what they want without thinking of the risks and the mistakes that might be caused.
8.0	If the children never make some mistakes, they will also never try anything new.
8.0	For which mistakes will offer us the oppotunity to get in touch with the chances and experiences.
8.0	For example, my cousin wanted to learn how to play the skateboard when he was 11.
8.0	Although many of his friend's parents thought this sports was dangerous and easy to get hurt.
8.0	His parents agreed with him and let him try anything if he was interested in.
8.0	Then he practiced a lot and win the first prize in the national competitions.
8.0	If his parents were afraid of making mistakes, he will never gain that achievement.
0.0	Admittely, it is reasonable for parents to afraid children making mistakes and tried to protect them as much as possible.
0.0	It will be better for childern's development to let them try a lot and learn from their own mistakes.
0.0	What's more, parents can't protect kids forever, after all they have to go their way by themselves.
12.0	Individuals always have trouble in how to deal with the problems, just like the way to get along with others ,the words can express their toughts best...
12.0	Because of everyone wants to keep the relationship between others,we have to learn the best way to handle that when  get troubles.
12.0	It's very universal in the class,and faced the elders we respect .
6.0	When the class are disscussing an issue whatever the dibate are extremly, I think if you put up your opinion, the professor is welcome to listen to.
9.0	The genuine in study is have questions and explore the  konwledge.
9.0	For instance, my college teachers are very willing to listening our thougts in the curriculum,they thought this is very helpful to kown  about what we have troubles and they can explain it with more ditails contribute to we learn about it deeply.
7.0	The instance of interrupt and corrrc
11.0	I agree with this statment, in my opinion relax by watching movie or reading books are better than choose to relax by doing physical exercise.
4.0	on the one hand, you will not lose your energy when you choose to reading books and watching movies.
10.0	when you reading books or watching movies the only thing you need to use is your eyes, you don't need to move your exhausted body everywhere only sit and relax, afer a whole week study i always spend my time on watching movie with my friend, we all think it is really relax for us to spend our time.
4.0	on the other hand, reading books and watching movies can easy to make your body and mind calm, while your are reading book or watching movie you will only think about what could happend in the story what will happend latter in the movie.
10.0	As for me, when i was reading the book i always think about the plot of the fiction, and it is totally interesting for me to relax through frogotten so I won't worry about the things broder me in the real life.
4.0	Thridly, if you relax by doing physical exercise, in the opposite way you will use your odd energy to move you body, during the exercise you will also lose the only power that you have exercise can only make your body become much more tired, people will only do physical exerxise when they are energetic and have energy to waste.
10.0	All in all, reading anf
3.0	Do you spend time on going to the thearters, reading your favourite novels or playing ball game in your leisure time?
3.0	"To me, the answer is definitely ""yes"" because I usually watch the most up-to-date movies and read science fictions serveral times a month, at the same time, play football with my peers once a week."
3.0	But some people contend that watching a moives or reading a book is more relaxing that the latter thing I'm doing, for the reason that these hobbies will not get us tired.
11.0	Although, I insist that doing exercise is a better way to relax.
4.0	Spending time watching a movie or reading a book can actually guide us to a apealing world, where we can free our mind.
8.0	They don't need any physical movement.
8.0	We can just take it easy to have fun with the films and the books.
8.0	Also, It's pretty common for us to relax ourselves by these activities, thus we can have wide topic while chating with each others.
8.0	As for the counterpart, doing intensive exercise may hurt to part of our bodies, if we don't do it well.
8.0	Meanwhile, there is possibility that we cannot find anyone to play with us, in some cooperative sports.
4.0	However, doing physical exercise can help up with strengthening our bodies, a function the other methods cannot provide.
9.0	Physical health is an essential factor to our sucess, and if we spend some time every weekend on playing sports, we will be more healthy, less chance to be exposed under many diseases.
9.0	Thus, our body, like our inspiring system and immunte system will be improved.
4.0	We can develop our social skills throgh doing sports.
10.0	Take my experience for example
0.0	All in all, I agree with the idea that doing more exercise is better than other activities for killing our relax time.
0.0	Only in that way can we build up our body and improve our social skills, though it might hurt us in unproper ways.
0.0	Therefore, life will become colorful to us.
12.0	Recently, whether to help struggling strangers has become a hitting topic.
11.0	It seems that more and more people are willing to help others, which is a huge change comparing with the past.
11.0	From my opinion, it may caused by a more positive environment, people's growing abilities and trustive information.
4.0	Firstly, it is obvious that no matter the government or the public are suggest to build a friendly and kind society, which greatly influents and encourages all the people to become more helpful.
9.0	For example, on the most popular social platform, Weibo, many stars and thouse people with infiuence are likely to share their activities about helping people in difficulties and post the anouncement such as helping poor mother find baby.
9.0	Those really provide a encouraging environment to let people help others.
4.0	In addition, with the economy fast developing,people are much more rich then before, which means they have greter abilities to help those struggling strangers.
8.0	Maybe a man is really kind and warmhearted.
8.0	But in the past, he can't even fit himself.
8.0	However, with the development of the society,he also become richer the before and now he can do what he wants in the past.
4.0	At last, I think people were afraid to help others because they were scared to be cheated.
9.0	Everyone earns their money very hard, nobody want to spend it on a wrong person.
9.0	But nowadays,we have more trchnology to identify who is really struggling.
11.0	There is no doubt that everyone will make mistakes.
11.0	The most important thing for us is know how to correct mistakes in the right way.
12.0	So the question comes out: How can children know the right way?
11.0	In my opinion, the best way for children to know the way is learning from their own parents.
10.0	When children make mistakes, parents should help their children know the useful experience from mistakes.
4.0	For me, I don't agree with the statement.
8.0	And my reason is divided into three parts.
8.0	The first part is that children have no ability to learn from mistakes by their own.
8.0	For example, a few children do some bad things when they are young.
8.0	Unfortunately, in their mind, these things are not dangerous and harmful to the society.
8.0	Children are weak in distinguish what is right or false.
8.0	They will learn nothing from mistakes.
8.0	In this way, making such kind of miastakes is so dangerous that they will continue to make the same mistakes in the future.
4.0	The second part is that making too many mistakes can't be forgiven by parents.
8.0	Every time children make mistakes, parents allow them to make mistakes for several times.
8.0	One mistake can only happen once.
8.0	I think parents should be strict with their kids because knowing how to deal with one kind of mistake in advance is useful for the future career for children.
4.0	The last part is that mistakes includes two kinds- legal and illegal.
8.0	Parents' attitude toward two kinds of mistakes must be different.
8.0	When children make illegal mistakes, children should be punished in order to let them the serious effect for mistakes.
8.0	Every children is not allowed to break the law.
8.0	On the other hand, if it is a normal mistake, leting them learn from their own mistakes is okay.
1.0	In a word, distinguishing the kind of mistakes is really important.
1.0	And it is needed by parents.
3.0	"To begin with, this type of ""Reward System"" has become a trend for decades, especially in many asian families."
3.0	The logic behind this trend illustrated that the greatest effort you put on, the satisfied return you could get.
5.0	"From parent's side, offer school aged child money is a good way to teach them ""no pain, no gain"", you can get the reward only if you study hard."
8.0	This tells them study can make thier life better which means more pocket money in this casel.
8.0	Secondly, this method will assist child to build their perspective of value, to set up thier short term goals.
8.0	Thus, this could be a rerally positive strategy to help children grow up.
5.0	From Children's side, when they realize the high mark equals to money, they will be encouraged to study harder in order to get the reward.
9.0	In purpose of getting the money, the only thing they could do is study more and invest more time on review the knowledge they've learnt before the exam.
9.0	Once they got the money, they benefited from the hard work, they become better off than other same age child, they will know it was all worth it.
1.0	However, parents should cordinate thier child in order to help them to avoid cheating or illegal competing.
1.0	In my opinion, this reward method is a good way to encourage child, because only hard work pays off!
12.0	Nowadays, there is a disscuison about the teachers' payment that the teaches should be paid at least as much as doctors, lawyers or business leaders are paid.
11.0	I strongly agree with the statement for the reasons given following.
5.0	First of all, the rise of salary can make the teacher a high concentrate on the education.
8.0	The motivation of our daily life is money, without money, there is no leisure for us to persue something more.
8.0	If the teachers cannot solving their daily cost by their payment, they would not focus on their work.
8.0	And when they get high payment, I mean, as much as the doctors, lawyers,etc, there is no doubt that teachers would dovate all their time in teaching.
8.0	To illurtast,  in my senior high school, our physical teacher hold an addition class personnally and advisties that we can have that to get more information and practice about the test.
8.0	We attend this class and pay extra money to her.
8.0	Had the payment of our teacher get higher, He would not to choose to hold an additional class which is unruly.
5.0	In addition, teacher deserve the payment as much as doctors, lawyers or business leaders.
8.0	The influence of the education is wildly.
8.0	A well done education indicate the prosperous of the society and the teacher can give the civilian the apporach to everything they want.
8.0	Contrast to the other positions, if teacher get well paid and the quaility of edcation, the benefit to the country can be priceless.
8.0	For example, one of my friend work in the education position and he says once he get the higher payment he would use these to get more attach to the students and know how can he work more effective.
2.0	In summary, I agree with the statement that teachers should be paid at least as much as doctors for higher payment can stimulate the motivionmo teacher deserver the higher payment
3.0	Nowadays,many parents  are concerned that how to deal with problems of education.
3.0	Recently parents give their children money as reward to praise their progess in their study.
11.0	Some people thinks give children money is a bad idea.
12.0	because children will spend it unwisely.
9.0	And it may build a wrong value for children.
9.0	However,I think it is a good idea to teach children,make them know both knowledge and manage their money.
4.0	To begin with,giving money can stimulate children to study harder.
8.0	For instence,pets do something right,their master will give them food as reward.
8.0	Then the pets will know what they did is right.
8.0	So does us humans,when children recive reward after their hard work,the study will become a happy thing instead of a boring routine.
8.0	So setting goals for children is necessary for the children to persist to study harder.
4.0	Financial thinking is also an important ability that is useful for children.
8.0	By giving money as reward ,children will have chance to manage their own money.
8.0	Financial thinking not only is of benefit for their current life,but also for their furture.
8.0	FOr instence when i was very young, every time i get pocket money,I will spend them on food.
8.0	But when i grew up,i have my own money,i will save them to buy what i want to improve my level of life.
4.0	Admittedly,it is unwise to give so much money when children get a good grades,because children's goal for study is not seek for knowledge but seek for money.
10.0	How to find the balance matters.
0.0	We must insure that children will not misunderstand the meaning of we give their money and keep a right attlitude.
0.0	So we should encourage them ti build a right value.
0.0	If we find the banlance point we can easily to teach them knowledge and how to have financial thinking.
3.0	recently, there is a statement that the internet provides so much information that creates problems.
3.0	as far as i am concerned, the internet provides us a lot of valuable information.
11.0	the reasons are as follows.
5.0	firstly, for the children who is growing-up, the internet can provides their a lot of information, which provides them a good way to study better and broad their horizons.
10.0	the children will meet a lot of question when they study, and it is not enough for them to just have classes at school, the internet can helps them a lot when the meet the difficult works, and though the internet, the will know a lot of things that they don not know before, for example, my litter sister mary, one day she had a difficult problem when she studying, she asked me for help but i had no idea either, then she went though the intenet and found a lot of information about it, the solved the problem in a short time.
5.0	secondly, for the adults who is working, the internet is a good place to relax themselves.
8.0	with the development of our society, more and more people are under a lot of working pressure, they need some place to relax themselves, while the internet is a good way to relax.
8.0	people can watch funny movies or reading books through the internet, what's more, they can releases their working pressure by talking with some people they don't know.
8.0	take myself for example, a friend of mine, lucky, we meet each other on the internet, and we always talk about our life or working pressure or some interest things we have through the internet, talking with her make me feel very comfortable and forget the working pressure.
2.0	last but not least, for the old peole, the internet can help them make a lot of friends and make their life more convenient.
10.0	old people can do a lot of things through the internet, such as asking for some help on the internet, when they feel uncomfortable and their children can help them, they can ask for help in the internet, and some of people will help them.
3.0	Parenting style, an issue everyone thinks about, has been attached great importance to and even trigger a heated discussion about the manner about parents educating their children.
3.0	Children should be cared for in any aspect by their parents in many people's view.
12.0	On the contrary is my perspective that parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes due to its beneits for both parents and children.
5.0	What we must prioritized is that making and learning from the mistakes help children cltivate their personalities.
8.0	Initially, children can develop their independence from mistakes.
8.0	To be more specific, children will be more independet and make some correct decission on their own after they learn from the mistakes they commited.
8.0	Additionally, children can achieve the quality of persevance.
8.0	Specially, only they make miastakes and learn from them, can they realize the importance of sticking to everything they struggle to, such as studing more assiduously, doing exercising frequently and practicing their English per day.
8.0	How can a child without commiting any mistake achieve success in his future career?
5.0	What should be equally discussed is that parents will be the beneficiaries during this process.
8.0	To begin with, when letting their children make errors and learn form them, people will be satisfactory with children's growth, which cannot be observes in the caring parenting style.
8.0	What is more, only this manner can promote and improve the intimate relationship between with parents and their children.
8.0	To be more specific, via making andl learning from mistakes, children will understand more about heightened expectations form their parents which foster their relationship in a better way.
8.0	Take a father, Mr Wang, working in a bank, as an example.
8.0	By let his children commit and learn from them, he felt more satifactory and content with his child, which promote their relationship meanwhile.
0.0	Children's personality, will be cltivated in the process, as illustrated in the passage.
0.0	Parents' satifactory and their relationship with their chilren, will be fully achieved as exemplified in the instance.
0.0	In conclusion, it is a good way for parents to let children make mistakes and learn from their own mistakes because its benefits bring to them.
11.0	Nowadays, some parents thinks to give money to their school-age children to reward them fo high grade is necessary,  while others do not think so.
12.0	In other words, some of former think that this way can make children know that if they work hard, they would gain more.
11.0	But in my opinion, I think this way would spoil the children.
5.0	Children who alway been given money as a reward would develop some wrong thinking.
8.0	They would think evrything they do should gain what they expected.
8.0	"As we konwn, the competation of apply a famous university like the Yale and the Havard would be a extremly difficlut thing, if the children who always gain a rewars for high grade as they were young grow up, they might think in that way: ""Oh, I want to apply this univeisity so I can gain the offer."""
8.0	The problem isthat  they ignore that what kind of level  of trying hard they need, they might think even do less can get the target.
8.0	Thinking in this way would impact their mental health.
5.0	It also would make these chlidren think money is the only thing they focus.
8.0	They would abandon their family, their friends and would be alone at last.
8.0	Just like some owner of big company, money is the only thing they want.
8.0	These traders just think how to make more and more money every and every time, they do not have energy to care about their parents' healthy, their children's grades, and maybe they would also give their children money as a reward just like when they as a children.
8.0	It would spoil their offspring too.
8.0	This circle would continue.
0.0	Form that all above, the parents who do in this way are not good at their children's growing.
0.0	Every one want to give a good education to their children, is not it?
0.0	So, do not do in that way, please.
3.0	Imagine what would you do when you encouter with a sophisticated problem in your homework assignment?
3.0	Would you choose to ask other students for answers or to spare no effort to cope with the difficulty on your own?
3.0	It is not uncommon that high school students are prone to cheat in homework.
12.0	As far as I am concerned, the most effective way to reduce the phenomenon of cheating is to increase punishment to the students.
4.0	On the one hand, punishment could serve as a reminder for students not to cheat on their assignments, otherwise they will afford high price.
8.0	It is because students should be educated to behave well in accomplishing their tasks.
8.0	Under no circunstance should they cheat in homework assignments.
8.0	If they violate rules, they have no choice but to receive punishment.
8.0	Consequently, high school students will recognize that it is their wrong behaviors that result in the high price that they have to pay.
8.0	In this sense, the punishment will remind them of well behavior in doing their homework.
8.0	This point can be confirmed by the example of myself.
8.0	I used to copy my classmate's math homework because I did not know how to apply calculus to solve the advanced mathematical problem.
8.0	But my mother realized that I did not do this assignment by myself.
8.0	Not surprisingly she required me to wash the dished for a whole week.
8.0	Since then I have never cheated in finishing homework because the punishment reminds me of the wrong behavior.
4.0	On the other hand, increasing penalty is the most practical way to educate students in doing assignments by their own.
8.0	It is because punishment could be put into practice whenever students copy other students' answers.
8.0	That is to say all the things teachers have to do is to announce the students about the rules and then reinforce the rules.
8.0	Nothing else is needed.
8.0	My sister is an English teach in a high school.
8.0	In order to prevent students from cheating in the homework, she makes rule about copying answers in homework and asks students to assign their names on a flyer.
8.0	Those who cheat in doing homework will be punished according to the rules she have made.
4.0	Admittedly, I do not deny that other two ways are not effective in leading students to behave well in accomplishing their homework.
8.0	However, either asking helps from parents or requiring teachers to create innovative assignments has the best results as the first measure do.
8.0	For instance, seldom do parents have time to supervise their children doing homework because they are engaged in endless works.
8.0	What is more, some tasks are naturally unreasonable for teachers to create them to be difficult to cheat on because making choices between four answers is a type of question.
2.0	To put it in a nutshell, the most effective way to reduce the phenomenon of cheating is to increase punishment, for it is not only the most practical solution, but it also serves as a reminder for students to behave well in finishing their homework.
3.0	With the development of modern society, an issue about how to cultivate leadership has been heatedly discussed.
3.0	Are people born to master the ablility to lead others?
3.0	Or can they learn to be a leader?
11.0	Though I cannot deny that someone are born to be extraordinary, I am stronly in favor of the opinion that people can learn to be a leader.
4.0	My general point of view is that leadership derive from famlily education.
8.0	It is common in the history that the offsprings of a king tend  to know how to lead his people.
8.0	This is not because they have the innate ability from their parents.
8.0	In fact, they are always told by their parents how to organize their schedule and how to bring the country to summit of thriving.
8.0	In another words, leadership is passed  by experience and words instead of blood.
8.0	For example, my uncle is a  well-know businessman welcomed by his employees.
8.0	His son John has been educated by my uncle since John was born.
8.0	My uncle told him how to treat people in gentle ways and how to keep balance between making profit and keeping workers pleasure.
8.0	Predictably, John learned fast and he made his own company in his 20th.
8.0	John's experience is proof enough of the opinion that leadership mostly comes from family education.
4.0	An equal essential factor is that leadership can also be obtained from social experience.
8.0	Ma Huaten cannot be a better example.
8.0	He was not from a wealthy family.
8.0	On the contrary, he was too ordinary when he was a child.
8.0	However, after years of fighting, he quickly knew how to be a leader.
8.0	Perhaps from other successful elite, or perhaps from the society itself, he mastered all the ability to lead others.
8.0	It is not a short process.
8.0	On the contrary, it needs years of social experience to learn the secrets inside.
8.0	Finally, he succeeded by creating his own company-Tencent, which is a company worldly famous in a variety of fields.
4.0	Admittedly,  there are someone who are born to be smarter than others.
9.0	However, one cannot be a leader if he has not received any education or if he has no social experience because a perfect leader does not have the single quality that deserves encomium.
9.0	In another words, one can be a  innate genious but a good leader is never born to be.
2.0	Judging from all the evidence above, we can confidently arrive at the conclusion that leadership never comes naturally.
3.0	As time goes by ,we will face to finding jobs in the future.
3.0	In the school, some students thinks that having a good communication with others is a very important skill in a future job.
3.0	Others suppose that only studing well can we have a good job in the future.
11.0	As far as I am concerned, studying hard is more important than relating well to people.
12.0	Here are my reasons.
5.0	First of all, college's scores are one of the most important things that business caring about when we ask for a job.
8.0	So only studying well can we have a good first impression.
8.0	Take my elder sister for example, she was very good at studying and she had almost four GPA when she was graduated from the best college in my city.
8.0	So last year, she went to the HuaWei to find a job, the manager did not hesitate for a while after he knowed my sister's GPA.
8.0	Had my sister not studied hard in school, she would not get a job which she wants sp easily.
5.0	Second, by studying hard in school, we can learn lots of knowledges which could benefit us all the life.
8.0	And we can not only learn the knowledges but also have the skills that how to study.
8.0	My uncle's story can illustrate the point.
8.0	My uncle was graduated from a unknown university, but he was hard-working in his university life.
8.0	Everytime when others were playing computer games or having an excursion, he was reading in the library.
8.0	So after four years, he had learned many kings of skills and found a good job.
7.0	So, studying hard in school not only can benefits us when we find a job, but also can teach us many knowledge and s
3.0	There is not any creatures have longer time with their parents than human.
12.0	So there are more quesitions about how to parenting as humans' parents.
12.0	For parents, it must be really hard to let their children to make mistakes that could be avoided if they ask the children not to do those things.
11.0	However, for children, making mistakes is the best way to learn-- You won't touch fire for the second time.
12.0	So the argument might begin in this question, parents would like to protect their children, but children prefer to being free.
6.0	From my experience.
8.0	let children make mistake is a better way.
8.0	When I was about 6 years old, I was trying to learn riding bikes.
8.0	My mom hated to see me injured so she always keep up with me and make sure I am enough safe.
8.0	Then I nearly spend one month and still cannot ride at all.
8.0	Thing bigins to change when my dad came to teach.
8.0	He just allowed me to ride in any ways I want.
8.0	At the first time, I fell down cause my mistaken way to ride, but when i started the second try, I know the right way and be much careful.
8.0	At last, I can ride just in one month.
2.0	In my consideration, it's obviously really hard for the parents give up the opptuniI partly agree with this statement.
12.0	Nowadays, more and more people are concentrated on what the super stars are doing.
12.0	They like to talk about their favourite celebrities such as popular singers or actors, famous athletes and so on.
12.0	Recently, what level of the stars influence on younger people and older people becomes a tropical topic.
11.0	Some people believe that the oldrer people are more likely to be influenced most rather than the younger people.
11.0	In my opinion, I think that younger people are easiler to be effected.
5.0	Firstly, the celebrities are more important to younger people because more younger people want to be popular.
8.0	Most of the juveniles have a dream about becoming a famous start in the future, so they are more likely to imitate the stars they like in order to achieve their desires.
8.0	For example, when celebrities like wearing a specific brand, the younger fans have a higher possibility to buy the same brand with their idols.
8.0	However, the elder people may do nothing due to the fact that most of them do not like these celebrities and they would not be willing to spend money on purchasing clothing.
8.0	They may want to enjoy their rest of life and buy the products which are good to their health.
5.0	Secondly, younger people are lack of experiences which can help them distinguish that things are right or not.
10.0	Most of young people are high school or university students.
7.0	They just
3.0	After people get the secure work, they begin to think whether it is satisfy enough to get the jobs right now.
11.0	In my opinion it is better to take it as soon as possible.
4.0	First and foremost, the chance maybe miss when people is thinking about it.
9.0	For one of my friends, he once get a job which is lack of people that time, and he pass the interview, but he thought whether the climate is fit for him, whether the meal is good there.
9.0	In the end, he miss the work, when he wanted to take it.
4.0	Then, the propare for the work which could make it more satisfy is not necessary.
8.0	People alwasy want to get more knowledge, useful skill before they take the work, but it is efficient to get the things you need require in the work.
8.0	My friend always want to make job more satisfied.
8.0	He do lot of proparation before the work, but once I asked how many advice was usefull in his work, he says, only a few.
4.0	Last, people could get satisfied if he do the work for a long time, because this it is useless to think of it at the beginning.
10.0	My friend was hated the unhappy work he do which is secure although, he change the atitude after 10 years' work.
3.0	Do you think give some reward like money to children after they get high grades in school is a good idea?
3.0	What's the parents' purpose of this action and what's the effect to children?
12.0	From my own perspective, I really agree with this satement and children's efficiency will be somewhat increased.
5.0	Approporiate rewards from parents to children can  really motivate children during their study.
8.0	Mayun, a Chinese businessman, is a typical instance to support my point of view.
8.0	When he studied in school, he thought haveing class and doing assignments everyday ar really boring, and thus he hated learning and wasted the precious time in school.
8.0	Given the serous problem of Mayun, his parents  come up with the idea to reward money to he if he can get high grades.
8.0	This action changed Mayun's life tremendously and he not only incresed his study effiency, but also preserve those money to do what ever he inerested in.
8.0	And just because those money help him find his own interest on being a merchan 10 years later.
8.0	Mayun's own story tell us that some reward system is always an excellent measures to help children find the factual funny of study, which means their stufy process is not blind anymore and they will get to knew what's the real purpose of study, and may also have the chance to find children's own orientation toward their future career.
8.0	Such a little actions can really cause striking results like Mayun, so why not try to use this actions?
5.0	Advisable pressure can help children study in a high efficiency thannothing to do.
8.0	Take myself, a high  school student, as an example.
8.0	My parents are also one of the participatation of this statement.
8.0	With a careful and hopeful mind, I will try my best to reach the high grades.
8.0	Although I will feel nervouse to get low grades and miss the money, I will not like before to evern escape class and sleep on the class.
8.0	My study attention will be obviously increased by hoping to get money and I will tell myself nothing will loose if I get low grades but a bunch of money will be offered once I get hight grades.
8.0	During this trade, I an the only to get benefits, so why not to encouge parents to carry out this plan for their children?
1.0	In summary, offering money to children after they get high grades can both motivate them to find the real meaning of study and give them pressure to study much harder.
1.0	Therefore, this actions can extremely benefits children in two aspects.
12.0	Depending on personal experience personality type and emotional concern,we find that some people hold the idea that reading a book or watching a movie is more relaxing than doing physical exercise.
12.0	For my view,I would like to entertainment instead of exercise.
12.0	My arguement for this point can be listed as follows.
6.0	The main reason for my propensity is that exercise would bring a tired mind to us.
10.0	For instance,one day we study for a long time,and exercise instead of having a rest,we would feel extremely tired because we use up both our mind and body's energy.
12.0	I disgree with the opinion that watching a movie or reading a book is a better way than phycical exercise to relax.
12.0	I think doing some exercise is  better  to relax ourselves.
8.0	Indeed, after physical exercise may made our body tired,but when we doing exercise,our brain is compelety have a break,yhen we can back to the study or work with a fresh man.
8.0	But, if you choose to watch a movie or read books when you get tired,the type of the books will give you oppiste feeling.
8.0	You may feel sad or happiness when youn read a romantica book, feel bored when you watching a newsreel, and the suspenseful books will give you many clues,to let you in , thinking or something.
8.0	we nearly need to move our bodies,but our brain never have a second to have a break.
8.0	The real relax we have is our relaxes our brains, physical exercise is better way to provided the atmosphere our brains need
3.0	Recently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debates among people: Whether it is more advantageous for people to travel in their own country than travel aboard.
11.0	Some people are prone to agree with the statement.
12.0	By contrary, I hold a totally converse perspective.
11.0	As far as I am concerned, traveling to different countries, without  doubt, are able to benefit people in all aspects, especially broaden their horizon and spicy their life.
11.0	My perspectives will elaborated as follow.
4.0	First, people will gain a lot of knowledge and experience they are unlikely to acquire the same as in their own country, thereby expanding their vision and strenthening their competence.
9.0	In different countries, there are various customs and traditions belonging to those places.
9.0	The natives there lives in a  brand-new lifestyle, which will influence you unconciously.
4.0	Gradually, people traveling there will learn how to think about things in a different way from what way they used to think about the same, which can enhance your ability to solve problems.
10.0	Nowadays, companies are more and more concerned about the abilities instead of the diploma, so the unique experience will absolutely leave a deep impression for others.
4.0	Secondly, during this kind of trip, people tend to meet with utterly different people, make a bunch of new friends, and even establish a cherished social network, all of which seldom happen when people travel in their own countries.
10.0	I can take myself as an example.
7.0	It was
11.0	As the internet and computer system developed in the modern day, more and more people, including children can use computer in home, school, or public place.
12.0	However some people think that it could be a disadvntage because that children might spend too much time on it playing computer game, that children should be restricted to play them.
11.0	In my opinion, I do not agree with the statement, since computer gomes is not always a waste of time, and do brings benefit to children.
4.0	Adimittedly, computer games have bad effect on children since they may addicted to it and cause them to be unhealthy.
9.0	That is reasoned as if a child is addicted on the game, he would shift his focus on study towards playing computer games, and if he spend to much time on computer, he will have problem on eyes due to blue light, and he will also has back and neck strain because he does not move his body to relax.
9.0	Moreover, it could cause mental problems such as afriad of social activity, since he spend too much time alone to play computer and forgets about how to make friend or communicate in real life.
4.0	However, this is an example when things grow too serious, and we still can fix this bad habit by teaching them about the importance of self-discipline, but forbid them to play computer is no need.
8.0	Computer game is a convenience method to relax them from the heavy pressure of study.
8.0	Since children nowadays have much more school works than the previous generation, the do not have much time to play out side, so computer game is an ideal choice owing to its convenience and flexible of time of playing, children can stop to play them immediately and can start to play for another time.
8.0	After the gaming time, they will be refill with enthusiasim to start to work on their additional work.
4.0	Also, playing some varieties of computer game can improve their intelligence.
8.0	As the gaming market is developing,some game that require strategy, the use of knowledge and logic appear.
8.0	By playing these gamesm children can strengthen their ability of applying knowledge and logic skills to solve problem, and boarden their horrizon from reminding them of the brand new approachs and use different tasks to inspire them.
8.0	Eventually, their minds will be improved.
2.0	In conclusion, computer game can bring benefit to children by relaxing them and improving their minds, and children should be allowed to play them.
3.0	I agree with the following statements.
3.0	Recently, there is a heated discussion about human ability.
11.0	Some people believe that when people are busy doing so many different things they can do everything well,because if they are busy doing so many different things they will get more skills that can help other things they want to do.
11.0	However, others hold a dissimilar viewpoint that people can not do everything well when they pay attention to different things.
12.0	My reasons and examples are listed as follows.
5.0	One reason why I am in favor of my perspective is that people should use time to get the key ofin one thing.
8.0	If they are busy doing many different things, they can't calm down and find the best way in one thing.
8.0	A typical illustration of this can be seen in me.
8.0	When I was a child I should practice violin everyday, but I also have to cleaning the house.
8.0	At first I was anxious to doing everything.
8.0	Because when I was playing the violin I thought of my housework, and when I was cleaning the house I remembered my violin.
8.0	At last I can't do one thing well.
8.0	So I turned to concentrate on my violin and forgot the housework, I do it well.
8.0	The example indicates that people should use time to get the key of one thing.
5.0	Another relevant reason used to support my opinion is that when people are busy doing so many things they will get tired and want to sleep, this means they are not have high efficient, so they can only do very few things well.
8.0	A good example of this is my mother.
8.0	She is so busy to doing many things, when she was finished one or two things she wanted to sleep.
8.0	And the remain things have nobody to do.
8.0	The example indicates that when people do many things they are not have high efficient.
2.0	In conclusion, theoretically and practically speaking, my viewpoint is a rewarding choice.
3.0	Nowaday,it is a prevailing phenomenon that an increasing number of people become indifferent.
12.0	They lack the reliance to others and rarely to connect with passerby.
12.0	therefore,I disagree that people today are more gladly to help the struggling strangers.
6.0	First of all,more and more people who  help others have not get good returns.
8.0	For instance,some olders usually pretend to fall down on the road.
8.0	At the begining,some people would go to care about them and bring them to the hospitol.
8.0	This bihavior is really warm.
8.0	Conversely,the olders do not appreciate to them,even cheat others that they are hurted by them.
8.0	If they do this,they can gain the money from the people who helps them.
8.0	But this behavior also cause other people afraid to help the ol ders when the olders are really hurted by the car.
8.0	To sum up,more and more people are not willing to help the strangers.
8.0	In the other hand,people in this generation  put more emphasis on their own.
7.0	In other word ,they
3.0	Nowadays, as the economical development of the society, many parents never mind to pay more to their kids to let them get good grades.
12.0	Whether parents should otter their their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school has sparked off a heated discussion in the society.
12.0	From my point of view,it is not a good idea for parents to par for their children's grades' progress, in that it will let students forget that it is their obligation and duty to get good scores in school, and thinks that they are study for their parents, not for themselves, and it would also make students from a bad habit that every good thing they do needs to pay.
10.0	First of all,offering school-age children money for each high grade they get in school may let students forget that it is their obligation and duty to get good scores in school, and thinks that they are study for their parents, not for themselves.
3.0	I would say yes when teacher ask we students to work together on projects.
3.0	I want to be watched, we team make desicions swiftly,and fooster my skills.
3.0	Due to my personalities, I am not suitable for working alone.
3.0	I am too lazy and I want to be urged.
3.0	Others in the team could make me work faster.
12.0	In other perspective, there would be always no breakthrough until people pay much attetion on me.
5.0	Besides, the desicions are made quickly after discussing and mistakes are easy to find during teamwork.
8.0	We usually have brainstorms which could take our working back to the right way at once if there is something wrong.
8.0	Take my cousin as an example, Jack once made a wrong figure but he didn't know what happened to the calculation.
8.0	Then the team where he was held a meeting and everyone did it once again.
8.0	Finally, they found the wrong figure and corrected it at once.
8.0	The reality story tells us how important teamwork is.
8.0	And we can find our mistakes during it.
5.0	Freakly, working together fooster my leadership.
8.0	I always long for leading my co-workers to succes.
8.0	In this way, I cultivate my ability of being a boss.
8.0	Also, my sense of achievement could be meet.
8.0	"It is called ""One stone kills two birds""."
8.0	As we all know, there are always free-riders in every team.
8.0	If I am the leader, I would stictly supervise those people.
8.0	And I could work harder to be free-riders' example.
1.0	My opinions are all above.
1.0	That's why I firmly vote for teamwork due to these pros.
3.0	When we work with a group of people on a specific task,we always need to find someone to make the final and siginificant desision for our team.
3.0	Becuase in such kind of team, different people have their various opinions about dealing with problem,while,without an integral suggestion,we could not undertake our work successfully.
3.0	So the leader has great importance.
3.0	But how to be a leader?
3.0	It is could be learned or just be a talent born with?
11.0	I think the way to be a leader could be learned.
4.0	First of all,being a leader is a matter of thing which has its own skills.
8.0	You can devide these into the conmmunication skill,learning other's feeling skill,controlling your own emotion skill.
8.0	If you have not communicate with a lot of people,you even do not how to get along with them,no need to say leading them.
8.0	So there a lot of things should be learned to be a leader.
8.0	Take myself as an example,I am a young teacher who does not have so much teaching experience and I do not know how to get along with my stendents.
8.0	This is very difficult for my to make them follow what I say.
8.0	While in my school,there is a teacher who has been a at this position for 20 years.
8.0	And he gives me a lot of advices to lead my students,which help me a lot.
4.0	Secondly,we should do learn how to control our own emotion.
8.0	When being a leader,there will be have a lot of opinions from you fellows and some of them will obey yours,this will make the leader feel frustrated and sometimes even angry.
8.0	At this moment you should learn how to control yourself and reduce the bad emotion.
8.0	While seldomly people are born with good mood and how to control yourself is an important lesson for a leader.
4.0	It is true that someone may have the talents of being a leader at first,but with the increase of the number of people they meet,the way to get along with them and lead them will become much more complicated than at first.
10.0	So the talented leader should get to learn new tricks of leading people and update their skills.
1.0	What are shown above are the reasons why I thinkd we should learn to be a leader and none of them should be ignored.
1.0	If you agree with these reasons and follow my suggestion,you will benefit from them a lot.
3.0	Nowadays,some parents give their children a lot of money when they go to school.
11.0	I think it is not a good idea for them.
12.0	It is common for parents to show their love or concern for children.
11.0	However,it may not be a good way to do so,and can cause some serious problems for children.
4.0	Firstly,a child can not control him or herself very well.
8.0	They can't help spending a lot of money when they get money from their parents.
8.0	Secondly,school is a place for us to study instead of shopping.
8.0	Too much money from parents makes students bacome lazy and forget the true meaning of studing in school.
8.0	They will spend more time on spending money than learning.
4.0	Thirdly,children can not protect themselves so well that they may get threaten by other students and get their money lost.
9.0	As we all know,school violence is getting more usually.
9.0	A student with much money is not safe in some way.
4.0	Fouthly,parents should care about children more by not only giving money to them,but also spending more time with them.
10.0	It is staying together with children which can help them grow better that really matters.
2.0	Studets can also make money by their own which is more meaningf
12.0	Now, famous entertainers' and athletes' are often the focus of media, not only their work life are known by the public,but even their privacy of life are exposed to the people.
12.0	Some insist that they do not deserve more privacy, because it's the price of a celebrity, whole them should be known by the public.
12.0	Others support the statement in the topic,because they are the person who are supposed to gain more respect from the social.
12.0	In my opinion, I definately agree with the latter, the more privacy they have, the more security they will have, no one is perfect, they also eager to have a personal life and they have the right to own freedom.
6.0	First of all, if the exposure of famous people can be decreased, their individual security is assured.
9.0	For example, Princess Diana died in a car accident when she was drving at a high speed in order to escape from the trail of dog packs.
9.0	Sometimes, enthusiastic fans always pick up their idols into airport or railway station.
3.0	After a lot of memories of our childhood,sits may remember ,if the exam to get good grades ,he can get some money from parents .
3.0	It is also from that era begins,some Chinese economic condition of the family,allow parents to do so.
11.0	But now ,with the continuous development of science   and technology,with money reward children's progress this now is becoming more and more common.
5.0	Some parents think is of course to children some role in promoting have power,the starting point is good,parents will pocket money as education for children or transfer a cultural significance of the important means,or as a reward,or as a kind of an expression of love,or as a result of return.
8.0	Money reward law really can enhance the enthusiasm of child labor,more important is to let the children know that make money not easy,encourage them to earn returns through labor,this understandable.
8.0	But, the simple money reward method only receive short-term effects,easy to make the child becomes the utility,obsessed.
8.0	In addition,some children still doesn't know how to save money ,and possible disorderly the money,Therefore,in the long run,simple to meet and incentive the child with money,for the development of children is unfavorable.
5.0	In fact,money reward law is just a kind of auxiliary of the education method,the children were adults must ,appreciation and the praise the psychological needs,meet this need ,can be a hug,a genuine praise, a small gift,the same can achieve good effect.
9.0	So I think children access to money ,sooner or later ,and avoid earlier than a child's money consciousness,In order to avoid the child to spending money or too greed money.
9.0	Parents should be early in the understanding of the money for children have the right guidance,help children establish correct function.
3.0	In the recent days, students are getting more and more group works.
3.0	These works are meant to improve their collaboration and sense of obligation.
3.0	But now there is a question lying in front of us.
3.0	Do the group works actually increase the effectiveness of the projects?
12.0	As far as I am concerned, I disagree the point that the group works will help to increase the effectiveness of the students than individual projects.
4.0	First, the increasing number of people will bring more discoordinance.
8.0	As all we know, every individual has their own different points of views.
8.0	And have every one who has active thoughts to coordinance is more likely to be a impossible tasks.
8.0	And when this situation happens, it requires lots of time to deal with even there is no solution to the disorder if no one will negotiate with each other.
8.0	For instance, my sister once was in a group works.
8.0	The teacher assigned a projects that each groups need to build a model for a car.
8.0	After all the joys her groups had, and when they needed to decide which material they become not harmonious.
8.0	Some said the car needed to be coated with the gilted silver, some said the car had to be marine blue.
8.0	After a long time, they could not negotiate and every one was stubborn.
8.0	She said if the project was assigned alone, she should have done it a long time ago.
4.0	Second, the situation might become weired that there will be one leader to guide the whole project.
8.0	As a research conducted by the MIT, the proportion of the group work turns into a single man guided group works will be higher than 56.8 percent.
8.0	It means that it will be more likely it will be one person to judge the whole project and lead the team.
8.0	If the project succeed, then the whole group succeed.
8.0	But, there is more likely to be a failure, then the whole team will take the price by the misleading of the leader person.
4.0	Third, if the project was assigned to be done by onlt one person, the person can prevent from the clamor and be high efficient.
8.0	As some people, they intend to enjoy the soleness of their own and wishes the absence of anyone who can potantially annoy them.
8.0	It actually has some scientific evidence that if one person will left alone, the hormone and pheromone level will decrease and let to the outcome of the reduce of the hippocampus which will reduce the stress from the outside stimulus and make people more concentrate.
8.0	People will be more high efficient and persistant.
2.0	To conclude, I disagree that students can learn more effectively than they are alone on projects.
3.0	Nowadays, people are paying an increasing amount of attention to the topic of teamwork.
3.0	In some schools, teachers would like to assign projects on which students must work together while other schools ask students to work along.
3.0	The attitudes toward this issue may vary from individual to individual.
3.0	A typical view is that students who are asked to work in group  always learn more effectively than students that work alone.
3.0	In my point of view, I totally disagree with this statement.
12.0	My view will be explained by analyzing the following reasons.
6.0	First of all, student working If students are working together, there may be a serious disagreement between them.
10.0	To get a unified view and solution of the assignment, they have to spend significant amount of time and effort on things that have nothing to do with the projects.
10.0	secondly, students in the same group may disturb each other by chating or the noise which is made by group numbers.
2.0	Admittedly, working togther can produce a variety of ideas, it may also disappoint some students because not everyone's idea can be used in one assignment.
3.0	In such a diversified cosiety, there are many selection for people to choose as a job.
3.0	Different people holds different views.
3.0	Some people prefer to have plenty of different types of works to do on workdays, another group of people are enjoying do a single works all day long.
3.0	In my opinion, taking different types of works can enrich our daily life.
12.0	My points of views will be explained by the following reasons.
6.0	To begin with, it is a common conception that different types of works require different skills.
8.0	Taking part in a new work will help us to learn a new technique or skills.
8.0	In my experiences, I learned pharmaceutical engineering in my college and gain some knowledge of pharmacy.
8.0	Although I have not chose a job which is relevant with my colloge degree, it really helps me in the later job.
8.0	I went to a medical company to run business about management, and the job acquires a lot of knowledge including accounting, statistics and even pharmcy.
8.0	Thus, I need to learn many new knowledge of different field, which fulfilled my daily life.
10.0	Moreover, participating different tasks in certain feild may meet many different people.
0.0	Finally, it is ture that people can improve the work effciency when they concentrate on one certain tasks.
0.0	Howeverm if a person works long enough on a some work, they would feel bored and baldness.
0.0	In many industry plant, many workers perform a single action for all day long.
0.0	Such as the porter, they need to carry the heavy bricks from the downstair to upstair for the whole day.
3.0	The problem has become a noramal topic in the world from long long ago.
3.0	but i think it is a good idea.
3.0	Most parents think study is more importent than other things,so they always think out some methods to encourage childrens to study,just like giving money.
3.0	However,some parents think money is not of benefit to chindren,because students under 18 don't have possessiveness.
12.0	They could use money to buy something they like,but no attention will be pay on thier study,it's dangerous.
12.0	Children in this age need thier parents' help to grow up,money is a good choice,it will merit wight out of its drawbacks.
6.0	If you choose to give money to encourage your children.
8.0	you have better to make a plan.
8.0	For examople, your chindren have to study have to get enough grades,so they can get money for drawbacks from you.
8.0	Study iss not boring,some things could be benefiit to their study.
2.0	"Money is good for children""s development,wo just need to teach them how to manage their money."
7.0	they
3.0	nowadays，more and more  parents have only one child, and they always give money tothem for their high grades ,I think this is not a good influence on children.
11.0	In my point of view, i strongly believe that parents should not give their children money as a reward for their hiagh marks.
5.0	First of all, giving money to the children just because of good grades,that may lead children to have utilitarian.
8.0	To be specific,once parents give money to their children when they get good grades,this may cause children establish a opinion that study in only for gainning money,but ignore the truth of studying.
8.0	to illustrate,my uncle used to reward my brother by money when my brother was a students.
8.0	My brother has a really good grades and he can gained a lot of money through this.
8.0	but after he went into the society,everything begain to change.
8.0	he failed in his creer and had a really bad interpersonal realationshoip just because he is too utilitarian,he has aurpose when he does anything,he can bear helping others without out any favors.
8.0	So until now,he is still nothing.
5.0	Morever,offering money to chiidren may make thier chilren catch some bad habits.
9.0	In that i mean when children have too much money,they may lose theirselves in some bad things bcause they have not have enough self-control,and this will make the lose outweights the gain.
9.0	For example,one of my friends gets a lot of money just because he has good grades.
7.0	He is a good student before, but after he graduated from junnior school,he developed s
3.0	Have you ever made some decision after asking your parents?
3.0	Of courese, everyone now are more reiling on their mom and dad.
3.0	Why?
3.0	Because parents have more tme to pay attension on their children, and they are more wiser than the parents in the past.
12.0	However, some say that people in the few decades before were likely to take care of their children.
12.0	I tatolly disagree with this statement, I will display my points below this paragraph.
5.0	To begin with, compared to the parents in the past , people are more richer than them.
8.0	Thus, they have more time and money to look after their chids, and help them make some choices.
8.0	As we know, in a poor family, the parents must concentrate on their bussiness rather than solve many questions from their sons.
8.0	For example, I used to live in unweathy home, my parents had to deal with their job's problems and always went to other cities.
8.0	In this case, they had no time to answer my troubles and help me make decisions, too.
8.0	After that period, they made much money which means just my dad could sustain the whole family's spendings.
8.0	Then, my mom began to notice me.
8.0	Hence, noadays young people must depend on their parents to choose some things.
5.0	In addition, parents are more clever than the people in past many years.
8.0	We all realize that many old man prefer to follow some stupid tradition to select the choice rather than thinking more carefully.
8.0	For instence, my grandpa used to teach my dad how to write the letters, which was very slow to concey the information, so my father did not want to listen to him.
8.0	He could use the Internet to transport the infromation in few seconds, which can totally solve my problems.
8.0	Thus, I would like to ask him for help.
8.0	So children now need their parents'hlep.
2.0	All in all, I think that the children in the past did not need their parens to make decision for them.
7.0	The parents are more important for children f
3.0	Most us have the feeling of benn rewarded.
3.0	It is a approval to the efforts you have made.
3.0	Actually, i think this type of reearding also works out between parens and children.
11.0	Someone may think children may be too young to manange the money by themselves.
11.0	But people hold tjis view made a common mistake that problems will not be solved if you only hide from it .
4.0	First of all reward children with money is a good way to motivate them.
8.0	As a teenager or a child, they might not be able to concentrate on their school work.
8.0	So it is necessary for parents to set a goal for them and motivate them.
8.0	What is more,the money is not on just mony anymore.
8.0	It is love and expectation parents have for their children.
8.0	As we all know , love is the best motivator in this world.
8.0	So the money parents offer will help students at school to study harder.
8.0	I stilll remember that when i was at primery school, i did not like study at all.
8.0	But the money my parents offered me forced me to study hard,becuase this way i can save the money to buy legos.
8.0	And in this way ,even at time i hated study the most, i still got great marks.
4.0	Secondly,rewarding children with money can help them to learn how to manage their money by themselves.
8.0	To spend the money at a young age can surely help teenager to understand how hard it is to earn money and how to spend the money properly.
8.0	There is no doubt that it is good for a child's development.
8.0	Me myself, can manage my pocket money well,and i even saved extra money for unexpeted situations for my parents have offered me money for my high grades.
4.0	Also, the money parents offered is like another kind of scholarship.
9.0	I really do not think that anyone would think scholarship is bad for children's growth,and so is the money offed by parents.
9.0	As long as the amount of money is reasonable, this type of rewarding is quite similar to the scholarship.
0.0	In this planet we are living now, it is a necessary skill for us to learn how to deal with money.
0.0	If we can learn it as a child ,we are actually a step foward than the others.
0.0	So , why not let parents offer their school-aged children money for each high grade?
12.0	I think it is both useful to relax by watching a movie orreading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.
8.0	As we all known,doing physical exercise do really relax ourselves.
8.0	It's a simple and stright way.
8.0	Once,you have conmpleted your physical exercise,you may get exhasted.
8.0	However,watching a movie may give us something different.
8.0	By watching a movie,we concentrate on it,so that can help us forget the awful things temperary.
8.0	Moreover,maybe bring us much laughter.
8.0	Besides,reading a book is a wonderful way to get yourselve relaxed.
8.0	There is no doubt that we are peaceful everytime we read a book.
8.0	Books can always calm us down.
8.0	Then you have a good mood,which is very important for you.
8.0	What's more,it can bring you something special,funny and fantastic.
8.0	That's really great to relax yourselfe.
1.0	Obviously,doing physical exercise can only make our bodies relaxed.
1.0	But,it is watching a movie or reading a book that can not only make our bodies relaxed,but also our mental.
8.0	Clearly,relaxing our mental is more important than relaxing our bodies.
8.0	As a result,I can't agree that it is better to relax by watching a movie orreading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.
8.0	To make your mental relaxed really counts.
12.0	In my perspective, such kind of action can never be a good idea if parents want their children to study well and obtain honour for themselves.
12.0	My explainations are as followed.
5.0	First of all, the action of giving money directly as award is too material and it may influence the original goal and motivation for the kids to study.
8.0	What we need to let kids konw is that they study and go through tests only for knowledge and their future developement rather than money or other material stuffs.
8.0	As one of my classmates in my middle school, he was born in a rich family and his father always gave him money when he behaved well in the examinations.
8.0	However, after some time, the company of his father was infulenced by some policy and his family wasn't as rich as before.
8.0	Therefore, his father decided to stop giving his son money as reward for good grades.
8.0	Unfortunately, the grade of my classmate began to fall since then because from his standingpoint, the sole motivation of studying had been deprived.
8.0	If we let our kids get touched with money or something else which is material, they will fail to recognize the real meanig of their life and the influence can last for lifelong time.
5.0	Last but not least, in view of the youth of these kids, it means that they don't have mature attitudes they should have to envolve into the society, including the right way to regulate the property they have.
8.0	If we give extra money apart from their daily expense, they don't know how to get the most use out of it and exert it for the most wealthy thing.
8.0	In the situation which is not so bad, like me before, I might use the money given by my parents for my good grades to surf the online shops and buy some cool clothes or some intersting things which are as a amatter of fact a kind of waste to my family at all.
8.0	However, if our immature kids make friends with someone bad, they may use their extra money for something really harmful or terrible.
1.0	All in all, I against giving kids money for their grades, as it's difficult for most of the parents to educate thier kids to form a healthy way to cope with money.
1.0	What parents should do is to lead their kids in a clever way and let their children realize the real significance of studying and examing tehmselves.
12.0	"As is known to us all, we Chinese people have a saying that goes,"" If you meet sommone in trouble on your way, you should stand out and help him a hand."""
11.0	From my opinion, Iwould like to offer my help to the strruggling strangers if possible.
4.0	First of all,  we would face the same situation, given that no one comes to care if we are in trouble, this world would become cold and cruel.
8.0	It is of human's social character that helping others means helping ourselves, so did ancient people claim.
8.0	If you send someone a rose, the smell remains on your fingers.
8.0	Well, I do not want to lie on the floor and helplessly ask for help but nobody cares me like I was abandoned by the world.
4.0	In addition, if we do the struggling strangers a favor, we would gain a sense of accomplishment, which could lead us to practice more like this to acquire more such sense.
8.0	Given that we help a person, and the person says thanks to us, what a great feeling!
8.0	And the person would give others a hand in the future for not wanting others to feel as painful as himself.
8.0	It is a possitive circle of social relatioship.
4.0	"However, many people who aim at cheating our sympathy and kindness pretend to ask for help, and they might make us the one who ""hurt"" them and force us to pay them."
8.0	In other word, we would be hut in our heart if we meet or hear such news which would convey really bad ideas to the public.
8.0	Though some bad guys stiil exist, if we make ourselves not to show our sympathy or not to offer our help, we will get frustrated or feel sorry if the strangers truly need help.
8.0	To judge those cheaters is the mission of the society, but choosing to offer help is the mission og ourselves.
2.0	I totally agree to help struggling strangers in the field we  can offer our help, and I truly hope all people could povide their own share of help to make the whole world a beeter place!
11.0	In my opinion , I prefer to finish the project with a group.
12.0	Different people has different view.
11.0	some people may like to finish thir project by themselves.
11.0	It may due to thei own personality.
12.0	I think work with a group will be better
4.0	Firstly,everyone has their own thinking.
8.0	so we can make the project perfect.
8.0	We can compound each person's idea.
8.0	For example , my pre-cacular teacher assigned me a project,and i have to finish it by myself.
8.0	I spend a lot of time to think the greatest idea.
8.0	It's was too diffiult.
8.0	I just finished it as quickly as i can.
8.0	When the teacher give it back to us.
8.0	My project isn't better than other's.
8.0	My teacher told me that i just have an great idea,but in other group everyone has an great idea.
8.0	their project is more creativity.
8.0	We can make everyone 's view together.
4.0	Secondly,the project will be more efficient.
8.0	In the group, every can has their own assignsment.
8.0	For instance,one group mem ber can search for the imformation or pictures,one people can calculate the equation,one person can illustrate their process to their classmate or teachers,and other group memebers can think lots of ideas.
8.0	And try to use many different ways to finish the project.
8.0	At last,we finish the project more quickly.
4.0	Thirdly,some people enjoy finish the project with a group.
8.0	They may think do the project alone is boring.
8.0	WHen they do the project with many people will be mere intersting.
8.0	whey they work for a long time ,they can talk about some intereted thing with others.
8.0	They may find they have same interested.
8.0	And they will make lots of new friend.
8.0	In some classes, they don't know each other's name.
8.0	So working with a group can meke the classmete be familiar with each other.
0.0	In conclusion,there are many advantages for finish the project with a group.
0.0	Just like to finish the project quickly and perfectly.
0.0	I t also make the relationship between classmates better.
3.0	There are many kinds of events in our daily lives.
3.0	And some of them are essential such as cooking, which is the source of the food.
3.0	However, some people believe that humans would spend less time on cooking in the next two decades.
11.0	In my opinion, I think this idea is unconvincing.
12.0	On the contrary, people will spend more time on cooking and the preparation for food in the future, this is because people will pay more attention to the healthy life style in the futrue.
11.0	Also, people will have more time for cooking in the futrue.
5.0	First, people are bound to pay more attention on the healthy life style in the next two decades.
8.0	This is because with the life condition becoming more and more better, there were no difficulties for most of  humans' survival.
8.0	Thus they will start to consider about how to live better and live long.
8.0	So they will pay more attention on the access to healthier life style.
8.0	As a result, they might spend more time on cooking rather than just having something to eat roughly.
8.0	Taking my grandma for example, when she was a little kid, the surrounding was unfavorable and there were the famine, people were eager to get something to eat even regardless whether it could be eaten, no one would think about how to eat healthier.
8.0	But nowadays, after suffering such a tough age, she is more cherish about today's life and always thinks how to live better, thus she spends several hours on cooking everyday in order to make the food more healthier and live longer.
5.0	Second, people will be released from the stress of complex laborate, it is not necessary for people to   sit in the office day and night.
8.0	And the machines will deal with it instead.
8.0	After having more spare time, people will spend more time on the events of their own daily life, thus more and more people will spend more time on cooking.
8.0	Taking my uncle for example, he used to work in the factory as the editor to write the code for the machines.
8.0	But with the technology developed, machines can set about working automatically nowadays, and people just need to sit at home to inspect them.
8.0	Now, my uncle gets up late everyday morning and prepares the breakfast carfully for his family.
2.0	In conculsion, people will no longer be limited by the conditions in the real life with time going by, so they will spend more time on cooking in the next two decades
3.0	Nowadays, people perfer to make thieir journey with a group and led by a tour guide.
3.0	Undoubtedly, this could be the best way for our tour.
3.0	The tour guide is able to help travellers to order the right dish when they cannot speak native langauge.
11.0	Also, guide can tell is to go to the Britian Museum instead of other boring places when we are travelling in England.
12.0	Then, guide can make a tour schedule which most fit the travellers time.
12.0	All of these are brought by the guide.
5.0	First, tour guide can speak native language, which will play a significant role in our journey.
8.0	Some investigations shows that almost ninety percent of travellers choose to tour with a guide, and more than a half of them thinks guide's ability to speak native language is the most important since the travel group can make travellers have no probelm when they want to express their needs.
8.0	For example, when you need to buy some products when you travel abroad, such as perfume, tissue at forth.
8.0	How can you even buy it if you are not capable in saying them in the right expression.
8.0	That's where the guide show their importance.
5.0	Secondly, guide can show me some more intersting place especially in some places I have never been.
8.0	For example, I have went to England with some of my friends.
8.0	In the forth day of the trip, I told the guide I preferred to go somewhere I liked rather than following the group, then the guide agreed, which made me very regretful.
8.0	I went to a town which is unknown to most people, and all I could do was just wandering around and seeing the passengers, which is boring.
8.0	Since then, I decided to follow the guide every time I went out with group since the guide was more familiar with the places we went than us, which could provide much better experience.
0.0	Last, some people may argue that the travelling with a group can limit our time and through other travelling ways the time management is better.
0.0	Take one of my journeys for instance, I still travelled with my friends.
0.0	Without the guide nearby, we could hardly manage our time properly, because we could sleep till ten am or elven am, which would make the plan for the morning useless.
7.0	Because our laziness, the trip will become a very boring one if the guide is not nearby
11.0	People today in China are willing to help the struggling strangers, but they fear to do so.
11.0	Most people in China are willing to let the aged people sit on the bus, metro, and train.
12.0	However, some fear to help in more serious situation because of the lack of trust between people in China.
5.0	In China, the society promotes kindness between people.
8.0	such as standing up to let the old, pergnant, or ingured people sit down.
8.0	There is specialized seats for those passangers with special needs on most of the public transportations such as bus, metro, and train.
8.0	There is also volunteers that is willing to spend their time in helping out strangers.
8.0	People are willing to follow to those rules and leave those seats for the people who need them.
5.0	However, in more serious situations, people are less likely to help because of the lack of trust between people that is built up by cruel lies.
8.0	In the past, there has been multiple situations of old man or women lying on the ground with a broken bone waiting for help.
8.0	However, when someone comes over and help them up, the old man or women goes to court accusing the person who helped them up to be the one who knocked them down.
8.0	This is especially common in places without a camera or witnesses.
8.0	This action of decieving those who are nice caused a lack of trust between people in China.
0.0	Many people in China have been deceived, their kindness to strangers are used by those who doesn't really need help.
0.0	Most people today in China are willing to help the struggling strangers, but most of them fear to be deceived.
0.0	Though the actions of most teenagers in China, we can observe that teenagers in China have courage to treat strangers with respect and kindness, but their respect and kindness is used by those who deceives them and make profits from it.
11.0	In my opinion, young people should have the ability to plan and organize.
5.0	First of all, knowing how to plan and organize can help young people ignore distractions and do things efficiently.
8.0	A plan clearly states what to do at a time, so people can hardly think of doing something else at a time.
8.0	It helps one get things under his control.
8.0	Take my cousin as an example.
8.0	She is a person who really good at organize her time.
8.0	During holidays, she always makes lists of what she wants to do and what she has to do.
8.0	Then she breaks the lists apart to plans of what to do everyday.
8.0	When the holidays are over, she aleays finds herself doing a lot of things that she planned before.
5.0	Further more, having the ability to plan let young people have a clear direction of their lives.
8.0	Young people usually have a lot of expectations of their futures.
8.0	Learning how to plan and organize helps them get to know what they really want or need in the future.
8.0	When young people get to know what they really want or need, they have strong motives to accomplish their plans.
8.0	Relative research shows comparing to those who have no plans, people who have clear plans and targets of their future get better lives years later.
8.0	Even when they facing some problems that might influence their plans, those who have a clear direction can quickly adapt to their situations.
2.0	In con, young people should have the ability to plan and organize.
3.0	At the present times ,a lot of people are very busy,so have no time to rest or relax .
3.0	And now science and techonlongy developed,the life with each passing day,many people become more and more lazy.
11.0	They wantn't to doing physical exercise,and that they think watching a movie or reading a book is better than doing physical exercise to relax .
6.0	"I disagree adout this idea ,because  it is often said that ""Life lies in movement"",so we need to do physical exercise in our daily life ."
9.0	As far as l concered ,we haven't enough to make us to exercise our boby and touch the nature .
9.0	Then we all know when we  watch a movie or read a book ,we only need to lie down or sit down in the sofa ,chiar.
10.0	Finally ,Time is money ,we can't to spend our time in the meaningless things.
11.0	I really agree with the statement.
11.0	Because everyone's exprience is limited.
11.0	There are only a few people can do many things well in a specific time.
11.0	Hence, our efficiency will be affected by the different things we are doing quikly.
12.0	The resons why I agree is listed below.
6.0	In order to do many things in a certain time, we need to finish every different thing quickly.
8.0	Because of this, we can just do few things well.
8.0	In addition, we may become tired after doing a bunch of things.
8.0	Thus, the last of things will be finished in a really low efficiency.
8.0	For example, now I am a 16 years old student of senior high school.
8.0	Everyday, I am busy doing a lot of homework of different subjects.
8.0	However, the results are always out of my expectation.
8.0	So I choose to change my study method.
8.0	I make plans before I go to finish my homework, which means I choose to finish just some of the homework in one day.
8.0	And finaly, my changes help me increase the qualities of all homework in different sujects.
8.0	At last, I do good job in every exam.
8.0	Luckily, my story have been praised by my teachers and so many students come to me to ask me  for help.
8.0	All in all, doing so many different will really effect our study efficiency and we canonly do little things well.
8.0	So why noy try to just do some of the things in one day  and finally finish these in many days.
0.0	Although many people can only do some things well are not because they are busy doing so many different things.
0.0	But those people are just a minority.
0.0	Most of the people are adopted to the statement.
8.0	To illustrate, my mother's story have told me that the statement is really true.
8.0	When she was a staff in a company.
8.0	She need to finish many masks in a specific time.
8.0	At first, she wae just try to finish it as much as quickly.
8.0	But all her work are not good enough and ahe always be criticized by her bos.
8.0	But now as a mother, she tells me the story to let me konw that we can not only just finish our work as quick as we can.
3.0	Nowadays, some parents offer money to their children when they get high mark in school.
3.0	Some people agree with this action, and think it really works.
3.0	But my attitutde is just opssite from such statememt.
11.0	I strongly believe that offering money to childen when they get high score is not a good way and we do have better choice.
4.0	Offering money to children for the good mark they get will build a misleading thinking on their studying purpouse.
10.0	As parents, they must inform their children that they study for theiselves instead of their parents, money, or anything else.
4.0	Only when children realize the real purpose on studying, will they study hard for long times, not just in a short time.
10.0	And it will benefit their study in the long run.
4.0	Offering money to children who don't have a correct money concept will led to some bad consequences.
8.0	When children in shchool-age, they don't need much things to buy on their own.
8.0	Money will be something to show off at shool, which is not what parents and teacheres want to see.
8.0	In this aspect, money will not be anything to encourage children to study, but someting harmful on their personality and social life.
8.0	For example,they may try to make frinds through money instead of becoming nice and improving themselves.
1.0	We do have some other ways to encourage children to study, such as offering their a chance to do someting they always want,giving them a tiny gift instead of money...
1.0	offer a Therefore, offering money is not the best choice, we can do many other
3.0	Nowadays, with the development of  technique and civilization, modern life has bocome complex.
3.0	And whether young people need to have the ability to make a schedule has become a question for the yound people.
11.0	Some people think that young people don not need this ability.
11.0	But I think that  making schedule is of great significance for the young.
4.0	Firstly, making a schedule can make sure young people plan their life suffient.
8.0	When modern life becomes more and more complex, people have to face various chocies.
8.0	But time is limited, young people don not have so much time to take the mistakes.
8.0	So that young peeple should make a schedule for their life to make sure they use their time effictivly.
4.0	Secondly, making a schedule can make young people career successful.
9.0	A company always decide whether they should hire an employee by whether the candidate is puntual enough.
9.0	And the people who always make schedule can easily show his puntuality by handing in tiles on time, arrange the meeting before be required.
4.0	Lastly, making a schedule will pracitice one's ability to arrange things.
10.0	in summary, because of the threee reasons mentioned above.
7.0	I think that making schedule is essent
3.0	Nowadays, many people like to drive by themselves to travel.
11.0	There are many reasons why they do so: Their tirp may be more flexible, and they can choose whom to travel with.
11.0	Although traveling on their own has mant benefits, in my opinion, it is better to travel in a group following a guide.
4.0	First, a lot can be learned from the experienced guide.
8.0	The guides that works for years have board horizon and are full of knowledge.
8.0	Take my own experience as an example, I traveled to Yunnan one summer vocation, the guide was so smart and knowledeable that I learned a lot from her.
8.0	She told me what Yunnan people like to eat, what scenery was the best of Yunnan and all the myths of that beautiful province.
8.0	I also learned the unique language and concentions there.
4.0	Moreover, you may not have to plan for the trip.
8.0	People always feel confused when planning for something.
8.0	It is great to know that some one have made a good plan for them.
8.0	If so, they will need to do nothing but enjoy.
4.0	Third, making lots of good friends through the trip is really a good experience that people cannot have if trevaling themselves.
9.0	People from everywhere gathered by accident and shared their experiences and prespective.
9.0	It makes the trip meaningful.
0.0	In conclusion, even if go on trips on their own can be a good one, traveling in a group is further more beneficial to people.
0.0	People can gain a lot, such as friends, knowledge and joy.
0.0	Thus, with so much merit, why not having a trip in groups led by a guide?
3.0	Have you ever seen that some students are good at science but not good at literature?
11.0	Some people in the society think that all university students should take history coureses in order to understand the resources of their cultures.
11.0	When it comes to my opinion that university students don't need be required to learn history, I strongly agree.
11.0	There are three aspects that can help me to explain my idea.
4.0	First of all, add history courses into university students' schedual just can increase students' pressure.
8.0	Then it will cause students can't pay more attentions to their majors and choose less select courses which they are interested in.
8.0	For instance, my middle school allowed students to choose two select courses every semaster.
8.0	However, on the second semaster I entered this school, my school decided to let students take philosophy courses.
8.0	Then, many students decided to choose one select courses only in order to reviewed the philosophy knowledge and did the assignment.
8.0	Of course, we felt more stressful every final tese than before.
4.0	Moreover, although learn history can learn a lot about our native and culture, it is still meaningless to some kinds of students, such as students who are major in science departments and not good at literature.
8.0	For example, my brother is major in math and not good at literature.
8.0	Also, his university decided to let all the undergraduat students take history courses.
8.0	However, my brother was really not good at history because he cannot memorize some knowlege like where, when and who.
8.0	Also, after a few days he memorized these knowlege, he would forget them totally.
8.0	Then after the semaster ended, he learned nothing about history and be sick of history courses.
4.0	Finally, I think many knowlege people must know has been known before they enter the universities.
7.0	It will be better to take history cour
3.0	Everyone holp that they have the important position in others' heart.
3.0	Some people think that we should try our best to spend all of our time to accompany he or she in order to acause his or her cognition that we are important in their life; however, some people think that we should keep distance with others because the distance can make others see value on us.
11.0	In my opinion, we should to choose the appropriate behavior according to the different people.
5.0	On the one hand, the familiy members are our most close people who can contribute coutless to us; therefore, we should spend all of our time to acompany them as possible as we can whatever .
8.0	My own experience can successfully illustrat this viewpoint.
8.0	In my childhood, I had lots of time to acompany my parents who can accept all of my mistakes.
8.0	However, I thought that I am still the person my parents most consern about simply because I am their son.
8.0	Nevertheless, nowadays I study abroad and there is a long distance between me and my parents.
8.0	I have no enougn time to accompany them like past and the sequance of their call to me gradually decrease, which makes me find that we always ignore the most precise people and  find this mistake when every was gone.
8.0	I pretty hope that I had spend all of time to accopany with them in the past and then they would have the same enthusiasm like the past.
8.0	Therefore, let us  spend our time as possible as well to do something with the people who love us mostly from now.
5.0	On the other hand, when we meet some people we ignore our appealling thought, we should apart from them let them know the result of with our accompany.
8.0	In the life, you always can see the events about decieve and ignorance.
8.0	The reason is that when you always contribute all things from you to some one, that people whill see your merchance as the things you should do.
8.0	When this kind of thing happend, you have to stop your goodness and apart from that person, which will let he or  she life in a condition without you.
8.0	Gradually, this people will see the diffence between the condition you are there and the environment without you.
8.0	Thus, he or she will find your goodness value you.
0.0	In our all life, we will meet different people who have different qualities.
0.0	Than we should to choos the appropriate behavior to cop with them.
0.0	To be specific, the familiy is the first priority; therefore, we should accopany our family member whatever.
0.0	When we meet people who are ignorance, we should to apart from them, which will create better ending.
3.0	Have you ever heard the Bafelt learned how to control his finance in a young age?
3.0	Of course not.
11.0	Some agree with that children should learn to manage their money when they were young.
12.0	However, I do not recommend this idea at all.
12.0	It is not a reasonable period for young people to control their money, and the first process should be the other way if the parents really want to cultivate a sense of finacial responsbility for their children.
12.0	I will express my point below this paragraph.
5.0	To begin with, managing money will distract children when they focus on studing.
8.0	As we know, 5-9 years old is a really key step for children to fundement their acdemic knowledge, it is not wise way to make them concentrate on the money.
8.0	For instance, I used to be tought to learn how to control my money by myself, the result was that I always thought about how many coins I left in my desk durng some major classes, such as English, Math, Chinese and even History.
8.0	That made my scoers declined dramatically, I sometime regreat it even for now.
5.0	In addition, it is unstable to give amount of money to a little child, there are some more suitable approaches for them to develop financial responsibility.
8.0	To take myself as an example, my dad used to tell me that I should pay everything I did bad.
8.0	Like breaking the windows, hitting the screen, punching others or playingfire.
8.0	I think these small things also can cultivate the responsibility for us.
8.0	Thus, we can have ability to manage our own finance.
1.0	Although, some say that it is helpful for children to make preparation for their future.
1.0	Nevertheless, I assert that each children can only get tiny money from their parents, which is not enough for them to learn something from that.
7.0	So it will be unne
12.0	I agree what watching a movie or reading a book is better to relax than doing physical.
12.0	There is three resons.
12.0	Firstly,watching movie or book can make person to pure mind themselfs.
12.0	Becuase we can receive the store or kownlage very easily,and hardly needs our mind in thinking.
12.0	But when we play physical exercise,it will spend our physical energy to make our feel tired.
12.0	Moreover,we always think what we shoud do in the physical exercise to get the win in the exercise.
12.0	SO doing physical exercise will make our mind in the environment which is not relaxed.
6.0	Secondly,watching a movie or reading is postive exercise.
8.0	According to the Movie and book can give our massage postively in relaxed time,we just need to recive this massage.
8.0	But when our play the physical exercise,we must postive to continue this exercise.
8.0	So this exercise will not relax ou
12.0	When asked about whether the young people has influence on those important decision, different people have different opinions.
11.0	Some people believe yes, because they think the teenager is the future of country and family.
11.0	However, I disagree with it, because I believe the young teenager doesn't have enough experience and knowledge to make decision.
12.0	And most of teenager doesn't have patience.
5.0	First of all, young teenager doesn't have enough experience and knowledge make decision, so they doesn't know the school and socity is different.
8.0	And they like to make decision according which one they like, they doesn't like make decision according which one is good or bad.
8.0	And most of adult people has enough experience and knowledge to make decision, they will think which one is good or bad, and which ways are more easy.
8.0	For example, when young people decide to go to out side to play ot stay in the home the review the textbook before the test, I believe most of them will choose to go to out side to play.
8.0	But their parent will ask them to stay at home to review the textbook, because it is good of their study.
5.0	Secondly, most of teenager doesn't have patience to make decision.
10.0	For example, when some teenager to decide which university is good for them, they will decide it according few factors, such as the adress of this university, and is there some intrested place near by that unisity.
10.0	This is why I
3.0	Today, we had had a discussion about whether some parents should offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.
4.0	Many people agree with it because they think it's a good and convenient way to let their children accept excellent education.
4.0	However,some people are strongly aginst it.
8.0	In my opinion,I really disagree with it.
8.0	A young man from ShangHai did it.
8.0	It seems like a good decision,but a long time past,his sonTim begin less independent.
8.0	And even worse,it makes him think moeny can solve every problem which he cannot solve it.
8.0	A young woman from WuHan even meet this problem.
8.0	Her son Jack like comparing with others for money not for his own special skills.
8.0	So his classmates very hate him and he loses many friends.
8.0	Some students even may be proud of money instead of success.
8.0	If he achieve his dream through hard-working,many students and teachers may respect him a lot.
4.0	Students these days need hard-working to achieve their dreams.
8.0	If he or she fails one time,he or she can continue doing this thing.
8.0	But if parents offer money to help students get in high school,it is unfair to other brave students who insistive and strong.
8.0	And these students may become more and more fragile.
8.0	If they meet difficulties in their everyday life,they will think their parents' moeny first.
8.0	They will have a strong sense of dependence.
2.0	Do you agree with me?
3.0	Will you have a better appetite when you can eat various kinds food eveyday rather than the same dishes every time?
11.0	The answer is very clearly.
12.0	People will get tired of one tast of food when they keep eating one thing.
4.0	Therefore, the same reason can be used for the works.
10.0	Workers will more likely prefer different types of tasks instead of similar tasks.
4.0	To begin with, different tasks are just like the ingredients of dishes.
8.0	If workers do the same thing every day for a long time, they will easily get tired and frustrated.
8.0	They may be distracted by other things in the twinkle of eyes.
8.0	Therefore, it is not good for workers to concentrate on the taskes, meanwhile, the working effient will decline dramatically.
4.0	On the second stage, learning new things is such a significant part in our life.
8.0	Different types of tasks not only can they let people keep being energetic, but also can make staff become prolific.
8.0	For example, if Steven the inventor of Apple company didn't study the art of characteritics, then the figure of the words in Iphones will not be as elegent as now.
8.0	Therefore, to have many different types of tasks will let these workers learn more skills, which can help them to act more efficiently and flexiblely when they meet a tough problem.
4.0	Last but not least, different types of jobs means meeting different types of people.
8.0	Thus, it is a superb way to color workers lives.
8.0	For instance, when these workers do different jobs, they can communicate with different persons, and absorb various attidudes which can open their minds.
8.0	Furtheremore, what is more important is that they can make some new friends.
8.0	Unlike to work the similar tasks all day long, the friends circle is very small, and the contents of communications are very limited.
2.0	To sum up, many different types of tasks will fill much new blood into workers' lives, which can make them become more positive, energetic, and effient.
3.0	Nowadays, quite a few parents praise their children's good academic performances through offering cashes.
11.0	As far as I am concerned, I extremely don't believe this would be a proper method.
4.0	In the first place, as we all know, school-age children do not have the ability to manage money well without their parent's help.
9.0	Take myself for example.
9.0	When I was a pupil, I always buy little toys some of which were quite unnecessary for me then with my pocket money outside my primary school.
4.0	Futhermore, providing children money for high grades could mislead them and contribute to their wrong views of money that we should do everything for the money.
10.0	Although money represents the capacity of doing various kinds of things, the purpose of study should be to absorb knowledge and to improve our skills other than to gain profits.
4.0	Frankly, we truely need some approach to inspiring children in that academic work is sometimes rather boring for most people.
9.0	However, since we have much more better measures, offering money to them is totally inproper.
9.0	For instance, parents could take their children to
3.0	The extensive development of technology benefits people in modern life in various sides, simultaneously, it brings out a series of social issues.
3.0	Some people, especially children, can' t help spending a great amount of time on diverse electronic devices.
3.0	Subsequently, with this phenomenon, whether cultivating children nowadays are harder than before arise a firece debate.
12.0	Whereas some people believe it' s not true, I do think due to these electronic devices, it becomes a tough task to educate children.
6.0	First, with the distraction of elec-devices, students tend not to focus on their study.
8.0	On the medias of phone or wed site, so many games and videos appeal to children' s concentration that they always indulge themselves in them.
8.0	When parents ask them to come back to reality, they could be extremely reluctant, even sometimes they may quarel with their parents.
8.0	Take my little nephew for example.
8.0	He was fond of various video games.
8.0	After school and arriving at home, immediatly, he started to play games with his netfriends, instead of finishing homework.
8.0	His parents had educated him for several times for his misbehavior.
8.0	But he did not correct them, even left home for a week.
7.0	Moreover, moblie phone and other online media contributes to the formation of children' s own viewpoints, so that they may challenge what teachers or parents
3.0	As the schooling plays a significant role in the development of the students, some questions are arose in the shool education.
3.0	Some students prefer to work alone on projects rather than work together with the groups.
3.0	They believed that they can have a free and creative environment to think by theirselves and it is their own honors for their work.
3.0	However, from my pespective, work together is an efficient access to help the development of the students.
3.0	There are three main ideas why i choose the view.
4.0	Firstly, students can learn knowledges and experiences from each other and produce creative views about the projcet.
8.0	Everyone has their unique thinking ways so that they have various kinds of answers.
8.0	Students wil  have a motivation and inspiration to put forward to more ideas.
8.0	That is excellent for your group to come up with many ideas.
4.0	Secondly, it provides an opportunity to cultivate the ability of helping each other and develop the unity of a group.
8.0	They are in a group and gradually get a sense of responsibility and unite in the team.
8.0	They will encounter with many challenges which get a way of their work.
8.0	Therefore, they could learn how to face with the team problems and solve the problems through the communication.
4.0	Last but not least, it is more effecient for working together.
8.0	There may be  few mistakes occured in the discussion.
8.0	Working alone may produce some mistakes that you can not find in your process.
8.0	However, the people in the group will correct your mistakes sincerely and communiate with your problems.
2.0	Above all, the students could learn much more effectively in a group instead of work alone and it is benefical to the development of students.
3.0	The discussion on leadership is on the rise, thus come to this question: whether it is deprived naturally or developed during the growing stage.
11.0	Undoubtedly in my perspective, leadership is obtained after birth, or one can learn to be a leader.
11.0	There are several factors that attribute to development: birth order, temperament, circumstance and experience.
5.0	Firstly,studies shows that first-born child tends to be better leader.
9.0	Cause these kids are learning how to take care of the their younger brothers or sisters in the family from a small stage, and they realize what responsiblity is.
9.0	These children usually have a outgoing temperament from which they would benefit when dealing with problems or partnership in a group.
5.0	Secondly,higher family education background may contributes to the developing of leadership of the children.
10.0	Parent are more often aware of the cultivation of versatile competency to the next generation.
11.0	Due to the rapid development of society, the issue of whether people should follow the rules that societies hope the young to follow has become an increasingly controversial topic.
11.0	Some believe the rules are too strick to follw, while others believe they should follow.
11.0	Although I have some doubts, I tend to agree with the latter, and I will articulate my view below.
5.0	Firstly, the strick rules can help humans tell right and wrong.
8.0	the reason why persons should follow the rules is that the contends in the rules are those people consider as something awful, so humans put them into the rules.
8.0	If individuals follow the rules and don't break them, then the people will be the persons who develop roundly.
8.0	For example, recently a sociologist and his team did a research to find the relationship between humans and rules.
8.0	And they invited about 500 volunteers to do the experiment.
8.0	Finally they found out approximately 75% people who follow the rules around them have a better life value and develope well.
5.0	Besides, it is freedom that the rules can bing to them.
8.0	The rules can protect someone who follow the rules.
8.0	If humans follow the rules, they will enjoy the benefit that rules can bring to them.
8.0	Rules, to be honest, is one thing to limit persons behaviors.
8.0	And if people follow the rules they may instantly feel no freedom, but the rules can bring more freedom in the future.
0.0	Finally, although it is uncomfortable to follow the rules, the rulas can protect them.
0.0	In fact, all of rules are built up to preserve the profit of most individuals.
0.0	And If someone break the rules, they will do harm to others' profit.
0.0	For example, all of people should follow the law in their countries.
0.0	and the law is to protect citizens in safety and finance.
0.0	But if someone want to rub others' profit which mean they must break the law, they will be punished.
12.0	As people's life getting better and economy goes well, no effort is spared to improve the quality of education of children.
12.0	As money is a sensitive topic among parents, there is a heat debate on whether parents should offer their school-age children with money for each good grade they get in the school.
12.0	Although give money to children may have some potantial risk, the benefits of giving money to children as award can be expected to exceed the disadvantage.
4.0	First of all, giving money to students can motivates students to study even harder.
9.0	One of the principles of economy suggests that: people respond to incentives.
9.0	As we can imagine, if the child got a good grade in one of the exam and got pocket money for this grade, he or she would just considered good grade equals award, which would motivate them to study harder and get more good grades for more awards.
4.0	Besides, giving money to students as award can cultivate their sense of achivement.
8.0	The money parents give to students plays a role as award which exaggerate the joy students get from good grades.
8.0	Therefore, the students will cherish this great sense of achivement and pursue this feeling once again.
8.0	As we known, the sense of achivement can help us strive for excellence and achive high, which will bring a lot of benefits for the students in the future.
4.0	Last but not least, giving money to students as award can develop their understanding of money and help them to arrange their money and spend them wisely.
8.0	"The money students get from their good grades is a kind of award they ""earn"" which are different from the normal pocket money they get."
8.0	Therefore, students are more likely to value their award-money and arrange them with caution can care, which cultivate their ability to arrange money independently.
8.0	Through arrange their own money, students may also undersand their parents' attitude about spending money.
2.0	From what has been discussed above, we may safely came to the conclusion that offering school-age children with money for each high grade they get in the exam is a good method to help children grow up, for it can not only motivates students to study harder and gain the sense of achivement but also cultivates their understanding of money and arrange their money wisely.
7.0	As we can imagine, if a student studied harder than before, addicted to the sense of achivement and had a deeper understanding of money, he would learn about the society earlier and exceed
3.0	With the development of the technology and the society, the computer become more and more popular in the world and people all spend a lot of time on it.
11.0	Playing computer games will let us know some important information more quickly and children can learn a lot of useful things on it.
12.0	Moreover some game in the computer can cultivate the logical and mathametic ability of the childern and also can let them have a relax.
6.0	Firstly, children can know some useful information by the computer games very quickly and clearly moreover the game will stimulate the interest of them on one filed.
8.0	Take my brother as an example, he was a middle school student and he liked to play computer games.
8.0	One game he play was about the Second world war; this game indicatd a lot of famous campaines and a lot of famous generals.
8.0	All of this appealed my brother deeply and he also checked some political figure who paly an important role in the winning of the war from some books beforre he played the games.
8.0	As a result of that, one day in the history class the teacher leted him to did a presentation to all of the children in his class.
8.0	And when they went to the high school the history still is the favourite field to him.
8.0	I think all of this can be credit to the game he paly because it stimulate the interest of him to history field.
0.0	Secondly, some computer games not only can let children have a relax but also can practice logical thinking of them.
0.0	I often paly some challenged games during the time I take a rest and when I finish one game, I feel refesh so I can contine my study and even become more efficient than before.
0.0	Furthermore, some games I play is to solve some crimes, this need us to think carefully who is the killer.
7.0	I must take care of  every detail of
3.0	It is a generally accepted fact that famous entertainers and athletes obtain huge reputation and weathy.
12.0	Nevertheless, privacy is a big problem for these famous people.
11.0	I am in tune with the fact that famous people are willing to have more privacy than they have now.
4.0	In the first place, to hold fast mroe privacy can protect these famous people's reputation because each small unappreciate behavior will be exaggerated and get massive negative feedback from public.
8.0	For instance, once media issue that Kobe who is a famous basketball player leave rabish on the ground and do not provide seat to old people in subway.
8.0	Therefore, there are lots of people say that he is not desire to recieve these reputation and even lots of people attack him on languague online.
8.0	Athough these behavior is not appreciate, it is a common phenomenone that everyone will make mistakes in life.
8.0	Koby receive so much negative comments because media notice his every behavior and issues online in order to make money.
8.0	Therefore, to be a famous people, more privacy is the event they want most.
4.0	In the second place, famous entertainers and athletes want more privacy since they hope their family can have the ordinary life like other civilians.
8.0	It is known to all that not only famous people live in front of madia, but also their family members are puted lots of attention from public.
8.0	These attention sometimes will create huge pressure for family members of these famous people.
8.0	The reason is that public may actually never know  their inner world and public always do adjudgments and comparision on these famous people's family members, which sometime make they can not follow their heart.
8.0	Therefore, famous people always take priority on more privacy since privacy never fail to enable their family live in a health and ordinary condition.
4.0	Furthuremore, more privacy can garanttee the famous people's security.
8.0	It is known to all that famous people are hignly wealthy; therefore, lots of people want use illegal means to obtain their money.
8.0	This way, once these famous people's privacy such as address and telephone number scatter on public, they maybe treaten and have lots of dangerous.
8.0	Therefore, famous people want more privacy since this can help them live in a secure condition.
7.0	To sum up, famous entertainers and atheles always deserve to have more privacy in order to give themselves and their family a secure
11.0	Yes, I agree with the statement that it is more important to have the ability of relating well to people than studying hard in school.
11.0	The reason of my opinion are the below.
5.0	First, if you could relate well to the people who is around you, you could share the problems on yourself to them, you could gather the wisdom of them and then soving the problems.
8.0	"An old saying says well, ""When every one adds fuel, the flames will rise higher."""
8.0	For example, if you work in a studio, there is a problem in a cartoon, will you choose to work on the problem on yourself?
8.0	Acctually not.
8.0	Because if you do it on teamwork, every one in this team will share their opinion with each other, and you could have the faster speed to solve the problem.
5.0	Second, if you could make the friends in the different countries or places, you will open up your eyes and have more information and the more knowledge of more countries, and you may be use the knowledge to the working in the future.
9.0	For example, Mark Zuckerberg, one of the initiators of the Facebook, he started the Facebook company with some of his friends, and the company is still running well in nowadays.
9.0	This example shows the importances of having the ability to relate well to the people who is around you.
2.0	Third, if you could relate with the students who is around you, you would deal with the relationshipbwtween the people and the people well .
3.0	Have a glimpse on recent society, with the developement on society, people become more busy.
3.0	They have to solve a variety of problems in life and work.
11.0	This terrible condition makes people cannot do somethings very achieve.
4.0	Firstly, doing different work will declines my consentration.
8.0	Each work has its unique thought logic and different solution.
8.0	We can use one mean to solve every problem.
8.0	Therefore, with exchanging tasts frequently, our efficiency turn high low.
8.0	For instance, trace to my high school.
8.0	My six subjects' grade are average because I distribute my energe into six subjects and every subject is not very excellent.
8.0	I always randomly learn one subject, which makes my grades are very bad.
8.0	When I concentrate on my mathematics, I just spend my all time on this subject and my grade is gradually improve.
4.0	Secondly, doing one thing's importance should be emphazed that is concentrate on one thing making people skillful on something.
8.0	Let me use a movie called Persue Happyness explaing.
8.0	In this move, a poor black's mathematics mare very good but he cannot get a good jor due to the point that he has too many thing should to solve such as playing with his son, sailing comper.
8.0	These different things consum his energe.
8.0	Later, he just specialize on mathematics and he becomes very skillful in finance, which makes he achieve his goal in bussiness.
4.0	Obviousely, solving different things can make people experience different events and maybe this is very funny.
8.0	Nevertheless, that will makes us lost direction for future because we do not have idea about what should I do.
8.0	Take myself as an instance.
8.0	I am a young boy and I am not sure what I do in the future.
8.0	Therefore, I try to play basketball, painting, do some computer work every day.
8.0	I am so busy and tired.
8.0	However, I am not good in anything.
8.0	Finally, I find that I like playing basketball and I practice everyday and I chieve my goal.
2.0	To conclusion, doing so many different things will distract you, make
12.0	Regarding to whether students should take the part-time job while they are studying in the university, people have different, even diamentrically opposite views.
11.0	Some of them prefer to pay attention to their study, while others would rather take a part-time job.
11.0	As for me, I opt to find a job, a choice which can strenthen my ability to dealing with something in my daily life and lessen parents' burden.
5.0	To begin with, as for an adult, not only do they should focus on their stufy, but also should exercise their society ability.
8.0	Such as learning how to sence motive and practicing how to commounicate with each other, which are very vital in their society and if they learn these well, it will beneficial to their future.
8.0	And they will have a better understanding of the world.
8.0	what's more, students who have a chance to get a job as early as possible have a change to stand out with competitors who wants to apply the I have a sister  who is named Linda, our relationship were very good so I knew her very much.
8.0	she found a job when she was in unniversity.
8.0	And by the job she exercised herself and comprehend a large number of skills from it.
8.0	The harder she worked, the more principle she learned.
8.0	Therefore, she has more dealing ways and this helped her to find a good job when she graduated from unniversity.
5.0	In addition, through the part-time job, students can earn money for the daily costs and relive the burden of their parents.
8.0	So theri parents pressure will be dimished.
8.0	There is no doubt that before they find a job, all costs depend on their parents, such as cloth, food and so on.
8.0	Unlike senior school students, students who in the unnivercity have more time to work and they can earn money to some meaningful things including reading books to open thier eyes.
1.0	In conclusion, from what I have discussed above, taking a part-time job play a role in their development.
1.0	I believe in that because not only do it can increase thier ability but also can earn income to support their life and reduce their parents' pressure.
12.0	Currently, whether young people have influence on the crucial decisions that determine the future of society has been a controversial problem.
11.0	In my own opinion, i think young people have this kind of influence.
4.0	Firstly, young people have more innovative minds that can give brand new decisions.
8.0	Young people today have directly get touch with the high advanced technology and more opening mind since they was borned.
8.0	In contrast, not like some conservertive old people still hold the view of keep unchanged.
8.0	These young people can give more innovative suggestions that can promote the improvements in the mechanism or the structure of society, although that cannot be achieved successfully, the governments will also trust the potential possibility, so they may accept the advising from young people.
4.0	Secondly, young people have learning more up-to-date knowledges that allow them to make more sensible and suitable choices.
8.0	Nowaday, more and more young people attend to study lots of advanced knowledge in some famous colleges, and they are also keep looking at the changing in the world every day, that mean they know how the world working today.
8.0	But some old people may only interested in some historic materials that not much context with present.
8.0	So young people can let society changing with the world change and make sure there will not be some errors.
4.0	Admittedly, old people have more experiences in the decisions making, but young people can also gain the experiences by faster learning speed than old people.
10.0	This kind of faste study ability allow young people learning more knowledges at short time, so there will not have the gap between the old people and young people in long-term.
2.0	In conclusion, according to the several reasons above, i think young people have influence on the important decisions that determine the future of society.
3.0	With the rapid development of society, education has been playing a significant part.
3.0	The question with regard to how to educate the children appropriately is worth considering deeply.
3.0	From my point of view, it is of great importance for children to makr mistakes and learn from them.
12.0	No matter how serious the mistakes are, parents should put more stress on learning from the mistakes instead of focusing on the mistakes themselves, just as an old saying goes, failure is the mother of success.
5.0	First of all, through the process of making the mistakes and learning from them, children can behave better, which in turn helps them to grow in a better way.
8.0	As is known to all, children always don't know how to behave appropriately from the beginning.
8.0	In this situaion, after the children have made the mistakes, like behaving inappropriately in public, they may learn from others' reaction that this kind of behavior is annoying and thus stopping it.
8.0	On the other hand, if the parents merely tell the children what is right and what is wrong, the children probably may not understand the reasons for the right or wrong behaviors, therefore this kind of education is not successful.
5.0	From another perspective, it is the method of learning from their own mistakes that contribute to children's future success.
8.0	This can be achieved due to the fact that children can recognize their own strengthens and weaknesses through this process.
8.0	For instance, in a mathematics class, the childern may make a large number of mistakes at first.
8.0	Under this circumstance, he might be frustrated about himself, without the correct guidance from their parents, it is highly probable that the children might not be interested in the mathematics class from then on.
8.0	On the contrast, if their parents communicate with the children patiently and guide them to learn from the mistakes, the children may recognize their own problems and solve them calmly.
8.0	Similarly, it exert great influence on children's future career and thus contribute their future success.
1.0	It can be safely concluded that it is a not only appropriate but also beneficial method for the parents to let children make mistakes and learn from them accordingly.
1.0	As has been mentioned above, it can contribute to children's growth and success as well.
3.0	Grades are one important thing to judge a student.
12.0	SO whether the parents should offer their school-age children money for each high mark oe not is debtable.
11.0	Some people think they should give because it can motivate their children.
12.0	However, I strongly believe that giving money will make the things worse.
10.0	Here are the reasons:
4.0	Firstly, it will make children not know they are studying for themselves.
8.0	Many children will think they are studing for money.
8.0	So, if one day, they go to the university and nobody will give them money, they will lose the eager to study, and at that time, it will cause bad results.
8.0	My best friend, Lucy, live in a family which parents will give her money when she gets good grades.
8.0	Day by day, Lucy gratually thought that she was studing for money or other things.
8.0	When she finished the middle school with a great grade, she go a famous High School in another city.
8.0	Without reciving money, she doesn't like to study at all.
8.0	At last, she wasn't able to go to a university!
4.0	Secondly, it may cause some bad habits.
8.0	In order to get the reward--- money, some students may cheat other students' answer without realizing they are making a very important fault.
8.0	This will make them not honest, and sometimes will have some influence on their life--- Compare with the honest, grades are just nothing.
8.0	One of the boys in my class, always cheating others' answers to get good grades.
8.0	So although it seems like he is good at studing, but it is not true.
8.0	Thereis one day for him to have a lesson.
4.0	What's more, I admit this way can motivate the child, but it also may make stusents like to show off in front of others.
9.0	This will hurt others and make others lose faces--- Which leads to that fewer and fewer people will make friends with the child.
9.0	So, in order to make the kid not feel lonely, please don't do like that.
2.0	All in all, it is not a good idea to offer school-age children money for each high grade.
3.0	When some stranger ask you to help him, for example, to use your phone, or exchange money, or just take some photos, would you help?
3.0	I will help, and believe that other people will also help, for everyone is kind when he was born.
12.0	In other words, people today are still more willing to help the struggling strangers.
5.0	Usually one reason we'd like to help struggling strangers is that if struggling strangers ask us for help, usually means thet he can't find any way to solve his problem right now, or he will turn to his friend or famliy.
8.0	For example, when unsolved deseases such as carrer come to a family, and the famliy is not rich, they will ask for their relatives for help.
8.0	And if they borrowed money from all of the relatives and still can't afford, they may have the only way to go: to ask strangers for help.
8.0	So usually people only go to ask others help when he run out of ideas.
5.0	The other reason is, people who are asked for help are easliy to ask himself: what if it happened to me, what would I do.
7.0	So we uaually change our position to think that if we are the strangers, we may go t
3.0	I hold the opinoin that people are more happy than in the past.
4.0	Firstly, in the past,  trasportation was limited by traffic devices such as low-speed buses or trains.
9.0	Whereas, nowadays high-tech traffic devices save lots of time when it is needed to a far place.
9.0	And we have more free time to spent with my friends or family, which enrich our daily life and increase happiness.
4.0	Secondly, net working provide convenience for all to learn knowledges or new things any time and any place.
9.0	In times without computer and network, people can study by only books or learn from people with specific knowledge.
9.0	So we have the chance to chase happiness from current convenience.
4.0	3.With the development of globalization, we live with more and more people from different countries and cultures, which enriches our lives with different living ways.
9.0	For example, Christmas Day was celebrated in western countries and Spring Festival in China, but nowadays we can enjoy the holidays together and share our happiness.
9.0	What's more, we can eat great foods from other countries easily in many restauraunts.
4.0	Of courese, some people may say we undergo more difficult competition and feel heavy stress from it, but it is also the globlization and current competition that enrich our life with more happiness!
2.0	All in all, I find people are living a happy life in the world and we should enjoy every second we spent in our lives!
3.0	Recently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people: whether increasing the price of gasoline and electricity is the most effective way for government to encourage energy conservation?
3.0	As far as I am concerned, this is not the most effective way to encourage energy conserveation.
11.0	My point can be elaborate as follows.
6.0	To begin with, promoting public energy conservation awareness is more effeive for government than increasing the price of gasoline and electricity.
8.0	To be more specific, people will realize the importance of saving energy if government promoting public awareness of energy conservation.
8.0	Then people will know they need to cut down the use of gasoline and electricity.
8.0	However, if government just increase the price of gasoline and electricity, people will just camplain about that and use the gasoline and electricity as usual since they do not know why the government increase the price.
8.0	Thus, government just increase people's living cost but do nothing with energy conservation.
8.0	For example, in my country, government make some books and TV programs to promote public awareness of saving energy.
8.0	After people read or watched these, they cut down their use of electricity and gasoline on purpose.
0.0	To be followed, increasing the price of gasoline and electricity is unfair and it just work for the poor people.
0.0	To illustrate, poor people use less gasoline and electricity than those rich people since they do not have much money.
0.0	If government increases the price of gasoline and electriciy, poor people will live in an akward condition because they cannot afford the cost of gasoline and electricity.
8.0	On the other had, rich people just use the gasoline and electricity as usual since they have money and they do not care about the price.
8.0	In conclusion, poor people just use basic energy and rich people waste a lot of energy.
8.0	However, increasing the price just reduce poor people use energy but do nothing with rich people.
8.0	So increasing the price is not effective.
3.0	With the development of the technology, it comes some quites of debates about the decisions of young prople.
3.0	Is it more convinient for young people to make the decisions by their ownselves?
3.0	Do the development of technology influence our decisions in some degrees?
12.0	As a common teenager, from my perspective, young people have stronger abilities to deal with the events and make decisions independently.
10.0	Since the development of technology and the improvement of the economic base.
6.0	On the one hand, the technological development enables us to deal with events easily.
8.0	To be more convincible, the increasing numbers of electronic facilities provide us more manners to deal with one event, then we can makes decisions by our ownselves easily.
8.0	Takes myself for instance, Last year I had   a confusion about the majors choosing in my university, and I losed my head.
8.0	However, the Internet gave me helps.
8.0	I searched large amounts of majors information in the Internet, like the employment-to-population ratio of the computer major and the topography major, and the comparation of the painting major and the sculpture major.
8.0	Fortunately, I found my favor course-- computer major.
8.0	And if I borned 2 decades ago, there were not any sophisticate facilities which can provide sufficient information that help me to make deicision by my ownselves, I just can make decisions depend on my parents or another eldership.
7.0	Obviously, the techology provides increasing number of manner to us to solve problems and
12.0	In my opinion,l agree that parents ought to let children fail and improve from the fail.
9.0	"As an old saying goes:""Failure is the mother of sucess."""
9.0	"It also called ""difficult education"",for example if you help your child in every where he could fail,he couldn't learn the way to solve and"
3.0	Recently, a controversial topic has arouse a heated debate between students:whether students should follow an ambitious dream or just achieve realistic goals.
3.0	Opinions vary from person to person.
11.0	Some hold the opinion that we should chase the dreams even if they are ambitous.
11.0	Contrary to the point is my perspective that people should focus on realistic goals.
11.0	My point can be elabrated as follows.
5.0	First, focusing on achieving realistic goals will give you more motivation and sense of achievement.
8.0	There is no doubt that the realistice goals are something which we can achieve by working hard for several days.
8.0	So every week people can gain a lot of sense of achievement for they have finished something.
8.0	This kind of motivation will let people become agreesive and then they will be more possible to succeed.
8.0	Contrary to this, if people want to follow their ambitious dream, they need a tight plan last even a year or more.
8.0	And this means people can only feel the sense of achievement every year which will let people lose the motivation to achieve their goals.
8.0	For example, my classmate Jason wants to get good grade this semester.
8.0	He did not set a goal just like getting GPA 3.8.
8.0	In fact, he just finished his homework carfully everyday.
8.0	He always told me that he was happy every time he finished his tasks.
8.0	Finally, he does get an A in the exam.
5.0	Second, realistic goals means a plan with more deatails which will help people become autonomic.
8.0	This is because the realistic goals always have a short period.
8.0	So you can decide the things you need to do everyday even every hour.
8.0	This will help people be strict to themselves and help them build an important charactoristic, autonomic.
8.0	When you want to follow a ambitious dream, you can just plan want to do as some single steps which will do no benifits for people to achieve their goals.
8.0	My cousin Tony studying at Wuhan No.1 High School has trouble in studying English.
8.0	He has set a goal that he wants to remember 600 words a month.
8.0	So he knows that he needs to remember 20 words a day.
8.0	He sets an hour every day to do this and finally finish his tasks.
7.0	All i have mentioned above has proved my point that we should achieve the realistic goals first but not to dream an ambitious
3.0	Nowadays, leadership is an imortant factor in achieving success gradually becomes one of the most popular topics not only among the students but lso in various companies empolyees.
11.0	Some people argue that leadership comes naturally while others hold that one can learn to be a leader.
11.0	In fact, leadership is a general concept.
12.0	It canbe classified in two notions: leading skills and charisma.
10.0	leading skills cna be learned bit charisma comes naturally.
6.0	First of all, leading skills refers to serval specific techniques which canbe mastered after systematic training.
8.0	These techniques include the decomposition of big goals, the use of incentive mechanism, proper distribution of work, tips on balancing the interest of various parties and so on.
8.0	Experts in management field have already work out mature theories or principles in these aspects.
8.0	With adequate practice, it is not difficult to use them skillfully.
8.0	Futhermore, even if without systematic theories, leading skills canbe improved through the accmulation of practical experience.
8.0	A man whose major has experienced to be an organizer inhis club.
8.0	How to make the whole team collaborate efficiently fulfill the goal in a firm somtimes is common with the same thing in a school.
2.0	In contrast, a person with no relevent experience will find it harder to lead such a team first.
8.0	But he will make it at last after enough practice.
8.0	Nevertheless, differently from specific leading skills, charisma in most cases can't be acquired through special training.
8.0	This kind of glamour refers to the attraction which can cast positive impact on his subordinates.
8.0	Such kind of attrective power comes from thre leader's nature dispositon which is to some extent hard to change during one's life and rich social experience which is impossible to get by merely aborbing indirect experience.
8.0	In general, charisma comes naturally and only a few of us has this kind of spritual attraction who make great contributions in human's history.
8.0	But for ordinary people like us, some useful leaing techniques is enough for us.
8.0	We have easy access to these specific methods thanks to theinformation era.
8.0	knowledge spreads widely on the internet.
8.0	What's better, a large sum of them charge nothing.
8.0	Therefore, it is not diffcult for us to become a qialified team leader.
3.0	To be honest, the techology is being more and more advanced.
3.0	In this case, some people may wonder if techonology is making children less creative than before.
3.0	But I have some questions for these people.
3.0	Have you ever seen the children who are interested in the new techonolgy work hard to develop their own creative products?
3.0	Have you ever seen the technology are providing children more methods to be more creative?
5.0	First, the children are interacting with techonology earlier than they were in the past, so some children raise the interests about the technology.
8.0	As a result, the children have chance to develop their own creative products.
8.0	Take the Steve Jobs for an example, he created the most creative company in the world, Apple.
8.0	When he was small, he was attracted by the mavelous technology, he thought this was so charming that he fell  in love with this.
8.0	Then, he wanted to developed his own product.
8.0	At last, he used a bug of the telephone company to create a system in which you can call others for free.
8.0	Although this may be bad for the company, but you cannot deny the creative factor in it.
8.0	When growing up, he also took this spirit to Apple.
8.0	So we can draw this conlusion that the techonology can boast children's creative abilities in some ways.
5.0	Secondary, as the development of the techonology, children have more and more methids to have a touch with the ways which they can be more creative.
8.0	For example, recently, the Stanford University held an online class which can increase people's creativity.
8.0	A lot of persons chose to show the video in the class to their children.
8.0	After taking the online class, the creativity of the children has increased almost 80 perscent, which was indicated by a agency.
8.0	The children can even imagine some grateful ideas which were never thought about by the scientists.
8.0	And the scientists may use these ideas to refine nowadays technology.
8.0	In this way, we can tell the truth that techonology is a very useful way for the children to boast their own creativity.
0.0	Last, some people argued that the product of the techonology may do harm to the creativity of children, such as the cartoon video, which is just wasting children's time.
0.0	In my opinion, watching cartoon video is just a good way to help children develop their creativity.
0.0	For example, there are always many physicial phenomeon in the cartoon video.
0.0	And when children see this phenomeon in the video.
0.0	They may think about other situations where the phenomeon can be perfectly used to help things be more convienent.
0.0	So watching cartoon video can still be a good way to develop children's creativity.
11.0	When talks about working, most people's reaction would be quite indifferent.
12.0	What I got from my friends or coworkers around me is that working is just a thing that I need to do everyday which is rather dull.
12.0	Few of them would show that they are excited to start the new day of working.
12.0	Well, for this situation, I believe that workers would be more satisfied and energetic when they have many different types of tasks to do during the workday than when they do similar tasks all day long like most of my friends do.
5.0	First, with different types of task, one will be motivated by the tasks and feel adventurous to start the day.
8.0	For instance, an accounter in a company, all he needs to do is to record the finance issues in and out of the company.
8.0	One of my friend is right in this position.
8.0	She said at first, she just need to do the caculating stuff at the begining of the month and then she is kind of doing nothing at the rest of the month which makes her feel really boring.
8.0	However, after she got the task that she needs to conclude the companies financial situation and analysis the datas and finally make a representation to the whole  company staff, she became nervous first, but soon, she started to focus her mind on searching the parts that can help improve the datas.
8.0	She told me that she was much more satisfied than before.
5.0	What's more, many different types of tasks can help improve one's ability to do a job and vice versa it will enhance one's self-confidence.
8.0	Take myself for example, as a tutor, I need not only help the students' academic development, but also to help them with some sort of daily issues like not willing to study or feel depressed about the trouble that they are facing and so on.
8.0	Through helping them dealing with every possible issues, I feel really content in my heart.
8.0	Since I am not just their tutor, I am their friend in some degree.
8.0	This cannot be fullfilled just teaching them something.
0.0	In conclusion, different types of tasks can help workers feel freshing everyday and give them something to looking forward to which a is win-win situation.
0.0	The company can get more things done and the worker can feel more satistifed and efficient.
0.0	So, why not do it?
3.0	With the developing of our society, we become more and more busier in dealing with our own things.
3.0	Hardly do we spend time in involving in affairs that are irrevelant to us.
11.0	It is obvious that people today aren't more willing to help the struggling strangers.
4.0	To begin with, people pay more attention to themselves so that they don't notice others.
8.0	For example, when I was in high scholl, I was occupied with too many classes.
8.0	From Monday to Friday, I had to take English classes.
8.0	On weekends, I needed to play the violine.
8.0	Though once a time , I read a message that a little baby was affected with serious desiease, but my mind was full of academic stuff and fianl papers.
8.0	Therefore, I did not care about this news too much and I forgot quickly.
8.0	In fact, many people meet the same situation as me, tht are less willing to help the strangers who are in need, because they have many  important things to consider about.
4.0	Additionally, it is commonly believed that people are scaed to help other because of the real events, they become indifferent and cold bloody.
8.0	Several years ago, a yong man helped an old lady who fell down, but the woman claimed that it was this young man who pushed her down and required him to pay money to her.
8.0	This news was certainly shocked a lot of people so that they didn't know whether it was true to give a hand to the struggling strangers.
8.0	Under this circumstance, a mount of people become less willing to help the truggling trangers.
4.0	The last but not the least, by observing our current society, we are surrouded with materials and vanity, people don't want to use their own money to help others.
9.0	In contrast, if they have enough money, they can not only invest to projects but also buy luxuries instead of donating to people in need.
9.0	Actually, this is really a common phenomenon nowdays.
2.0	In conclusion, taking account of the arguments above, I definitely disagree with the statement that people today are more willing to help the struggling strangers.
12.0	I think is a good idea.
12.0	When children get high mark, they should be prized.
12.0	I have fellowing reasons.
6.0	First, if you have a wish, you are willing to finish your tasks.
8.0	Even though this task which is really awful, you maybe insist to acomplish it.
8.0	Second, parents offer children money that has another function, which can teach thier children how to use thier money.
8.0	Third, children can have a stimulate when they get the money, so they will do better in the next text.
8.0	In modren society, students usually go to the class and people often attend meeting.
8.0	When the teacher or the meeting leader may take mistake that saying somethings inaccurate in your idea.
8.0	What would you do?
8.0	Opinions vary form person to person, some people in society think that interrupt and correct the mistake right away or say nothing is the best thing to do.
8.0	However, I have a different idea.
8.0	When it comes to the statement that waitting until the the class or meeting is over and the people are gone, and then talk to the teacher or meeting leader.
6.0	Firstly, this way is very polite.
9.0	It can not make teacher or leader lose face.
9.0	If I interrupt and correct the mistake right away, speaker may feel embarassed.
12.0	With the accelerating development of our society, more and more people start to concern about their life quality, but some people discover a disappointing truth that people now are less satisfied with their life.
11.0	Although someone contends that people have more materials than people in the past, I strongly believe that people are less happy and satisfied because they have much more pressure and they are more anxious with their life.
5.0	Firstly, the gap among people becomes larger and larger.
8.0	To be specific, now rich people are much more richer than the poor people, the difference among their status are extremely huge, that makes many people loss confidence.
8.0	In the past, people all lived in low life quality, in the same village, all the villagers were of the same status, the only hope of them was to feed themselves and their families, so they would be satisfied with their life if they got enough food.
8.0	But now, people lives in the same city can be seperated to many different status, some people maintain enormous properties but some people only have their singular house, the poor people could hardly construct their confidence and happiness.
5.0	Moreover, their are more competitions than past.
8.0	In other words, their are much more population than before, but the resource in society and the earth do not increase.
8.0	Thus people have more competition pressure than before.
8.0	The technology and science have developed further more than before, so the jobs need the staff to be more skills, people should learn more to suit their job.
8.0	So they spend more time and energy in learning, that makes them anxious.
8.0	On top of that, even someone is enough capable for a job, but he still should compete with a lot of competitors who are in the similar condition, that situation makes people more nervious and less satisfied with their life.
3.0	Recently, a new is so hot in the internet, the famous entertainers Cai XuKun have mysterious relationship with his one of vans at Sanya.
3.0	Many people like know and find famous entertainers' privacy.
11.0	So we have question about famous entertainers whether or not need to have more privacy than they have now.
11.0	In my opinion, i would say agree this statement, and i also have many example and reasons to illustrate my point of view.
5.0	First, i think people all should have more their own privacy, and the secret is a part of life to people.
8.0	Because whatever the entertainers how famous and hot, he or she also is a normal people, he should have the normal rights like the normal people.
8.0	For example, i have a brother is a basketball player, and his name is James.
8.0	He always teach me how to play basketball when I am child.
8.0	Today, he talks with me about his life.
8.0	He think his life is bored, he dose not have hisself privacy.
8.0	All day have people want to know his information about his life, he think these people are too bad.
5.0	Second, a famous entertainer's privacy play a important role in his life.
8.0	If the entertainer's privacys are found by other people, it is bad to his fame, and he might be lost his own profession.
8.0	For example, i have a friend is Nico, he is a famous singer, but when he were found in Helens this bar with his new girlfriend that older than he.
8.0	His fame is terrible in everywhere.
8.0	Original, our school has many people is his vans, but when they gain this massage, they all hate he, because he is a good boy in everyone's heart, he never is a bad boy.
7.0	Finally, nobody want to listenning he sing
3.0	I agree the statement that people are more willing to help others who are in troble.
3.0	There are three main reasons that can prove my view.
3.0	First is education.
3.0	Within the development of our society, our education is keeping developing either.
8.0	In the old days, people were only been tought some professonal knowledge and not most of people realize the importance of helping others.
8.0	But our educational development is really great these year and most people know the importance of giving a hand to other people.
8.0	It remains me of myself.
8.0	I still remember that I was told that helping a strangers may let you get a new friends when I was still in primiry school.
8.0	When I first came to my university, I was new there and I was a little helpless at that time because I know no one.
8.0	But fortunately, I helped a boy to carry his backage when I finished my own bussiness, thus we become a little closer.
8.0	For now, we are very good friend and we can always ask for help or just play together.
8.0	I thinlk my help is the begining of our friendship Second, self-realization.
8.0	People are not worried a lot about earning a living or making money in order to get enough food as before.
8.0	I think in the old days, most of people were told to finish their work first in order to earn money and make living.
8.0	But for now, there is a kind of tendency that people are more care about having a colorful life instead of just living in the world.
8.0	Helping others can make them happy, making them feel better in the whole day.
8.0	That's a really significant reason for my agreement.
6.0	Last but not least, media.
8.0	In morden society, everything will be spread fastly.
8.0	so people have more pressure about avoiding helping others.
8.0	"In such a big pressure, nobody wants to be ""famous"" because of avoiding helping others."
8.0	So people become likely to help others gradully.
10.0	That's why
11.0	First at all, I agree with the statement.
11.0	Everyone may have their own suitable way to relax.
12.0	In my opinion, atching a movies or reading a boook and doing phycal exercise is two very typical methods among all.
5.0	Reading books or watching movies can help people relax mentally.
8.0	These can make peole relax from hard mental works.
8.0	The colorful images of movies and ups and downs of the plot of the books can attract people from their hard work and pass the positive energy to them.
8.0	For example, some inspirational movies can really encourage people to have hope for our life.
5.0	Doing physical exercise can help people relax physically.
9.0	I think I don't need to explain much about this.
9.0	Obiously, it can make us healthier and makes our body move from sitting in front of the table in one way for long time.
2.0	But as for me, I prefer watching a movie or reading a book to relax.
9.0	Not only because I'm too lazy to take physical exercise, also  because I think watching a movie or reading a book can also makes me relax physically.
9.0	In spite of the fact that these may cannot make me relax more deeply than doing physical exercise, when I come back from school after hard working  a whole a
11.0	As the development of Interent, there are more and more information that we can get by using the internet.
12.0	But is more information means a better life?
11.0	I do not think so.
11.0	So much information in Interent can also cause many problem.
4.0	At first, the information may not fit the readers.
8.0	In traditional media, there are different information provides to different kinds of people.
8.0	A child will not get the information of  sex or violenec from the programs for children in TV, right.
8.0	But it is totally different in the Internet.
8.0	Everyone can get the information in the Interent no matter if the information is good for him.
8.0	For example, I went to school by bus last week.
8.0	I hread two little boys who sat behind me talking about the meaning of a dirty word.
8.0	And one boy said that he learn that from the Internet.
8.0	I am sure their family will not feel good if they know their children learn dirty words from Internet.
8.0	And the parents even can not stop this kind of things happened, because they can not hide all the bad information in Internet.
8.0	So some people will learn something bad according to the information in the Internet.
4.0	On the other hand, there also a lot of information is not correct in the Interent.
8.0	Everyone can write down what they think is right in the Internet, and the Internet itself will not distingulish if the information is actully correct.
8.0	So people may be misleaded by the incorrect information in the Internet.
8.0	For instance, many people said the earthquake in Japen will made the salts in China harmful to people in 2008.
8.0	It was totally incorrect, but many people believed it is ture.
8.0	So many people bought a lots of salts in the super makets and stored a huge amount of salts in their houses.
8.0	That made the price of salt highly increase.
8.0	Many people could not buy salt at that time.
8.0	So the incorrect information will surly  make many serious problems.
4.0	Although there many valuable information in the Internet, but it is hard to find them, beacuse the amount of infomation is too huge.
8.0	I have spent a whole afternoon to seach the answer of a simple question.
8.0	There are too many information are provided in the Internet.
8.0	So people must spend a lot of time to distingulish which is what they really want.
8.0	It is not so convinent to get useful informations in the Internet.
1.0	So much information in Interent do cause many problem.
1.0	I hope these problems will solve.
12.0	Nowadays, many parents are hardworking in order to give their childern a good living condition and best education, so they usually busy every day.
12.0	Some people think they should use their limited time to doing things together that related to schoolwork, but I argue that parents should spend their time to have fun with children.
5.0	Firstly, parents should use their time for that giving childern some best memory.
8.0	If parents do not have much time, so they cannot accompany their children all the time.
8.0	Children will spend most of their time on school for studying.
8.0	Some people believe that children's education is very important, so parents should use their limited time to help children's schoolwork, but I think this is the worst way for the relationship between children and parents.
8.0	Take me for example.
8.0	When I was in grade 10, my parents always busy, do not have much time to take care of me, so I spent much time on school.
8.0	Every time I went home, the first sentence that my parents asked is about homework,not my emotion or emper.
8.0	I really tierd of it, it is a bad memory for me in high school.
8.0	If parents have time to accompany their children, they should to give their children a good feeling, so both will happy when parents and children stay together for having fun, not just education.
5.0	In addition, Students have abilityfor their study.
8.0	Parents can not help children about their schoolwork, and students do not need the help.
8.0	Most of parents forgot acdemic knowledge and they are not in school, so they also have no idea for it.
8.0	Parents cannot help their children forever, so having fun with children is the best way for a family.
8.0	Parents always peach their children, but also they are not familiar with those work.
8.0	Most students can study by themslfe, those peach will make them feel bad.
8.0	For instant, my brother always study alone, but his parents always said he did not well, it will made he had nagetive feeling about his parents.
1.0	Finally, if adults have extra time, please accompany with your children for fun, not just acdemic work.
1.0	Family are together for happiness, not for high grade or high intellgent.
3.0	There has never been a moment in history that education is more important than today.
12.0	Since the parents are treating the education more and more significant, they are likely to choose a method which could encourage their children to be more interested in study, and receiving high marks.
12.0	BUt this phenomenon has aroused wide social conroversy that whether this initiatives will make the children believe money is the only reason for a good study or not.
10.0	However, I content that rewarding some money for their good grades is a good idea, telling them the effort will pay off.
6.0	To start with, giving the children some pocket money as a reward will stimulate children to study harder.
9.0	When children get feed back of their hard work, the study will no longer be a forcing choice to make.
9.0	We cannot object the barriers the children might g=face in their study
12.0	Yet the enviromental develop so fast, children are taking more and more important role in the future.
12.0	They would become happy and get more energy when they receive some feedback, so I think it's a good idea for some parents want to offer their children with money because of their grades in school.
5.0	At first, children who take money as their gifts when they have a great effort in school may easier to successed.
8.0	When children have the money, they are drived to study harder to get more money, so both the children and the parents gets bonus in their side.
8.0	For example, my friend Mary used to hate the study, because she thought study is boring and she couldn't get any benifit from it.
8.0	Her parents were worried about her, so they decide to give her some money when she get high mark.
8.0	Now Mary becomes one of the top students in her class.
5.0	Besides,children can do more things when they have enough money.
8.0	They can maintain their desire to better things, and make great efforts to attain it.
8.0	Most of the children don't have the finance indepentant, so it's a good oppotunity for them to use money freely, such as buy gifts to their parents.
8.0	To illustrate, my cousin have a little money and could'n t buy the dress for her mother, so she asked her parents to give money when she get good grades.
8.0	Both of them are happy.
0.0	Though some people may think it's hamful to the student when they get to much money, maybe they would use some unfair ways to have high mark, such as cheat in the exam.
0.0	But I still think offer the children money for their high mark has the more advantages than disadvantages.
0.0	For children, it's easier to get succeed and can help them to do more things.
0.0	So I think it's wise for the parents to give their children money as the bonus.
3.0	Nowadays, students are influenced by many things, like their parents, friends and their teachers.
11.0	I do not agree ith this statement, I think students are influenced more by their friend than their teachers, why I said that, because students spent more time with their friend, and they understand each others more.
5.0	Firstly, students are influenced more by their friends because they spent much time to stay with their friends not their teachers.
8.0	Students always think whenthey stay with their friend and they will be happy, so they will spent time to play with their friend, if your teacher talked with you about your grades and let you work hard, maybe you will listen to your teacher on that time, but when your friends want to play with your, and you will forget what teachers said.
8.0	For example, my friend Rebecca, she always get C in her math quiz and she will fail math if she doesn't work hard, her math teacher communicates with her too many times and she promised her math teacher she will go to tutorial and work hard.
8.0	After school, I wanted Rebecca go to supermarket with me, and she agreed, she played with me a whole afternoon,she forgot to go to her math teachers tutorial.
8.0	Students are influenced more by their friends not their teachers.
5.0	Secondly, they understand each other.
9.0	If you know about a person and you will influenced this person a lot.
9.0	Sometimes, teachers talk to students and let them to get a high level, and students will stress out because it is very hard to get that, when they talk with their friends, they understand each other, and they will reduce stress just feel happy, I think friends really influenced a student a lot.
10.0	However, teachers also influenced students, teachers have enough experiences to communicate with a students, and students will think their sentences are good for themselves, but when they stay with their friends and they will forget what teacher said.
2.0	In conclusion, students are more influenced by their friends than their teachers, because students will spend more time with their friends and they undersatnd each other more.
12.0	Many people in order to maintain frendship they choose to staye with a small group of people who have stay with them for a long time, but I think the make new freind is more important.
6.0	At first, I think make more new friend can enrich my knowledge.
8.0	To make new friend you will meet more people from all over the word.
8.0	They get different educations and have different background.
8.0	So you can learn more knoledge fro Second, making new freind is a great chance for me to increase my talking skill.
8.0	To make friends you neet to communicate with all kinds of people.
8.0	At that time a good way to communicate can help you get along with other.
8.0	All of these talking skills will be useful until you get to work.
8.0	For example, when one person communicat more with other, in this process, he might learn some tricks like don't interrupt when someone is talking, don't look around when you are talking.
8.0	When he become a worker, these small details can let others knows that he is a polite and respectful person.
8.0	Nowadays,the phenomenon that parents offer their school-age children money for the high marks they get in exams is common.
8.0	The parents want to motivate their children to study better through this way.
8.0	I don't quite agree this idea.
8.0	In my opinin,this method may work at first .
8.0	But when children grow up ,bouns strategy  doesn't appeal children as it used to.
8.0	Because when children grow up , it becomes harder and harder to satisfied their needs.
8.0	Money can't work all the , time.
8.0	On the one hand, children asks for more money , which you can't afford.
8.0	On the other way ,it leads to a bad habit of children.
8.0	I think, most importantly, parents should help children to form good habits.
8.0	Children should know that they study for theirselves,not for money their parents give.
8.0	Besides,in university, it is important for students to self-conmtrol, they should know the targets ,dreams they want to achieve.
8.0	So giving money to children is bad for their growth.
8.0	What's more ,I think,with time going by, children rely their parents more.
8.0	If one child get used to the money he get by their parents ,all he do is want to gain his parents'prize .
8.0	Relying on parents is not good for independent growth.
8.0	I think we children should know what we want and why we do this .
8.0	If you are blurred with your road,then how can you succeed?
6.0	Offering money for their good marks seems good in a short time .
8.0	But the damages it brings to children's independence   are long-term.
8.0	Once a person lose motivation to study .
8.0	He can never study well.
8.0	So I think offering money for their high marks is not a good action.
8.0	If you want your children to have a long-term benefits,you should let your children study by their own motivation.
3.0	protecting wild animals,one issue the government will encounter in some time,is of vital significance.
3.0	this is because wild animals will have a decisive impact on the well development of future generation.
3.0	some people believe that it is not the government's role to protect the wild animals while others hold the opinion that to protect the wildness is important.
3.0	personally,it is better for the government to protect the wild animals.
11.0	there are several reasons supporting my position.
5.0	on the one hand,protecting wild animals is to protect huiman themselves.
8.0	generally speaking,with the rapid development of our society,the population of mankind is increasing dramastically and the living space is expanding broader and broader.
8.0	if such behavior is not stopped,it is possible that our population will continue growing,which means human need more food and resources,thus leading to the fewer living habitats for wild animals.
8.0	then the people amy fight against each other for their own survival.
8.0	it is no wonder nowadays some countries are trying to control the bitth rate and appeal to people for fewer baby borning.
8.0	on the contrary,if the government take measures to control the growth rate of human population,there will be less competition between huamn and wildness .
8.0	thus the method not only protects the wildness,but also shield future generations.
5.0	on the other hand,future generation can see more living wild species,which  can contributes to their care for the nature.
8.0	typically,young chuldren are all excited and happy when they go to the zoos to see animals.
8.0	various animals such as the elephant,monkeys lions and giraffes will make the children aware that all the animals are cute,so they are willing to make friends with them.
8.0	there is no denying that people won't hurt their friends.
8.0	thus watching those living animals have a great influence on their development of careness for the nature.
8.0	it is really important to protect the wild animals.
8.0	for instance,I used to see animals with my mother,each time I went there,the monkeys would always smile at me,which made me feel refershed and exciting.
8.0	So when I see people hurting animals I will get really angry and stop such behaviors.
8.0	consequently,protecting the wildness is beneficial for future generations' loveness,without which they will get stuck when they deal with others future.
2.0	form what has been disdussed above,I fully reinforce my standpoint  that it is vital for the government to protect the wildeness,not only will it protect the future generation,but also will it benefits the care for nature of them.
3.0	The world we are living in becomes quite stressful recently.
12.0	Working people are wondering how they can feel better sense of satisfication -trying as many types of work a day or just focusing on one task.
11.0	Well, actually I think the two opinions are rather compatible than conflicting.
5.0	First of all, people can definitely choose a specific field to dive into and spend their time on it, so as to perfect the work they are doing or produce the product of world-class.
8.0	Taking Japanese artists as an example, they are painters, cookers, statuers, all walks of life.
8.0	However, they can transfom their work into a piece of art, making the product they make to be respected and the service they offer to be awarded.
8.0	They are just masterpieces.
8.0	It is the spirit in this nation that makes people enjoy doing one thing at a time, which illustrates doing similar tasks can have its own advantage.
5.0	Simultaneously, people fond of doing different types of tasks also have their reasons.
8.0	Among these resons, the most significant one is that it won't make them bored.
8.0	You can try as many as new things in a day, and if you are tired of one work, just stop to do another one.
8.0	For instance, when I work in the office, if I had to check with one form for a whole day, I would choose spare it in several certain periods of time, like this afternoon or tommorw moring.
8.0	This not only gives me many intervals to do others, but also it release the pressure on my minds, letting myself have more passions for better work.
1.0	In conclusion, I think both of the opinions make sense, and it is people's choice to decide which type is their preference.
1.0	Furthermore, they can even be integrated, with the different types and similar types being adopted in a week alternatively.
12.0	In the daily life, many parents may roar to their children even hit them when they make mistakes.
11.0	They think it can prevent their children to make mistakes.
11.0	However, some people think parents should allow their children to make mistakes, because  they may learn from their wrong way.
11.0	I think we should let them go when they make mistakes, there is a proverb that a fall into the pit, a gain in your wit.
6.0	Letting the children make mistakes does not mean letting them make same mistakes again, parents should let the children awaring the why they make mistake and how to avoid it teh next time by themselves.
8.0	On the contary, if parents tell them do not make mistakes, it can not let them realize what they are do is wrong, but just following their parents said, so they will make some same types of mistakes as well.
8.0	For example, my friends David broke some plates while he was playing with his friends in his home.
8.0	When his parents went home seeing these, they did not say anything like tell David do not make mistakes.
8.0	At dinnertime, David found that his parents did not prepare any food for him!
8.0	He was angry, and asked his parents.
8.0	His parents just told him, the plate is not enough, the food is nowhere to fill.
8.0	Soon David knew his errancy, he does not play with friends in the kitchen anymore, because he knew that plate broken, no food for him by himself.
10.0	Meanwhlie, the process to correct the mistakes can also inspired children, like Edison, if his parents told him do not make mistakes, he could not learn from the mistakes and after conduct 99 experiments, learn from the latter mistake over and over again, he would not produce the bulb,and we would use fire to light right now,
2.0	Therefore, wise parents may allow their children to make mistakes, believing them will learn from mistakes and avoiding doing mistakes the next time.
3.0	Obviously our world has changed a lot and we gradually grow up.
11.0	It is not common that some people think that what our grandparents say is useless.
11.0	However, I disagree with such idea.
11.0	I think the advice that our grandparents give us can also play a vital role in our life even the world has developed fastly.
11.0	My reason can be seen as following.
4.0	First, our grandparents are experienced and they have lots of tips about life.
8.0	As we know, we need to try several times before we really understand something and our grandparents have experienced lots of things thus, they have adequent knowledge about life, which will not change with time.
8.0	For example, when I was young, I lived with my grandparents because my parents were busy working.
8.0	I always fought with my classmates so my teacher blame me.
8.0	When I came home, my grandma told me when we were mad at others, we mad at ourselves actually.
8.0	Because it would just make us feel unhappy.
8.0	Since then, I learned to be tolerant, surprisely, I became more and more popular in the school.
4.0	In addition, whatever our grandparents say, they care about us and want us to be better and it can encourage us.
8.0	For the most time, we need advice because we meet some trouble or lose confident.
8.0	I think all of our grandparents want us to be better, thus the advice they offer us was actually a good encouragement for us, it can help us solve the problem too.
8.0	Take my friend Tom for example.
8.0	He was afraid of speaking in front of lots of people but he needed to give a speech.
8.0	Luckly his grandpa teached him that he could just imagine audiences as cabbage when he stand on the stage.
8.0	I do not know if it was useful but the result was that he make it perfectly.
4.0	Admittedly, there were some advice given by our grandparents were not suitable today, Nevertheless, we can also gets benefits from part of their advice instead of the whole.
8.0	For example, our grandparents suggest us to learn more knowledge form newspaper, however we have no interest in reading newspaper.
8.0	On the contrary, we can get knowledge from internet which we like best.
8.0	It does not matter where we get knowledge because we listen to our grandparents' word and learn a lot.
0.0	To sum up, we should be modest and respectful to our grandparents.
0.0	There have experienced lots of thing that we can not imagine, so they have many characters that we do not have.
0.0	The advice given by them is the symbol of their love and it can give us confidence.
0.0	I believe it will be useful all the time.
3.0	Do you think it is very benefit to the company to work only three days a week for long hours?
3.0	And do you feel that if you work for three day, you will have more time to enjoy your daily life?
12.0	In my opinion, I think work for three days a week but for long hours will reduce some extra fee of a company and by this way we can have more time to persue the things that are very important in our life.
12.0	So I agree with the opinion that it is more enjoyable to have a job where you work only three days a week.
5.0	Firstly, just work three days a week can bring a lot of benefit to the company so the salary of the employee will improve.
8.0	This is because, if we do the works for three days rather than do five day, we can save a big amount of money; just like the electronic fee and the managment fee.
8.0	We can image that a big company which involve ten thousands of people however they do not use the computer and the office- room for two whole day.
8.0	Concequently, the big company could  rent these places to other people who need it; with the decrease of the work day,  the employee have to improve their working efficience so a there will not have some employees who  just wast the time.
8.0	And with the time go on, the number of the employees will decrease because they just need to work for three day therefore the company just should maintain the active employees.
8.0	As a result of that, the salary of the employees will improve so they will work more active because the same finacial income will give to less people.
8.0	Finally, it will good for you work and future.
5.0	Secondly , we will have more free time to persue the things that we loveed and interested in because we have more free time and more money.
9.0	During the free time we can play football with our children or go for a hiking with our friends.
9.0	Nowadays, a lot of empolyees they focous too much on their work but ignore the most important things in their life and even though lose their good health
3.0	I dissagree.
12.0	When i called influence to myself,my first recomand person were my parents, they do played teacher's role in my life ,but   what i call influence or 'changed me' is not the teacher's part, it is to be my friend.
12.0	There is no write about why my parents 'How they be my friend?'  or some thing elss, this part we talk about why friends can change people, and why friends have more influenced to each other.
4.0	We usually envy some one who close to you.
8.0	like envy someone rich.
8.0	have so much dress to wire ,to chasing our enternal peace we usualy to change ourself to those 'envy things ' ways .
8.0	like a person nervey go outside to but something he didn't need ,but ,because he influented by some friend who likes to but some cool stuff ,and he think maby he will like thouse things too.
4.0	Other way, friends spend a lot of time together.
10.0	During this time ,most of those happy time ,people easily to get some similery things like the word using, hobbies , they are both individule person at first but some how ,they be each other's friend and spend lots of time,they are chainging towars to each other's side.
4.0	So,i called it influence.
8.0	Teachers usually was a character who let's you keep in right way ,teaching you knollege .
8.0	We study from them but we do not changeing our nature,knollege can't bulid someone's personality but friends will, a good friend will changing you to a good way and to be better, but some friend--i don't call they bad but they do have sort of bad influence ,guilding you changing wo some other dirrection which you would totolly regret ,so maby influence are not a whole better thing ,but people do changed when they go throgh some thing with some friends.
8.0	So ,that's why i think friends have much inflenced.
3.0	Working on projects is not strange to students,which indeed enhance their ability to practise.
3.0	When it comes to the way how students cope with this kind task,there are usually two approaches:working together and woek on thier own.
3.0	Some people think work together would learn much more effectively than work alone,actually i do not quit agree.
12.0	It depends on the propoties of the projects that the teachers assign on.
5.0	Working together  is conductive for students to learn from each other,which enables them to be more all-rounded.
8.0	it beacuse when students set out to do something.
8.0	they would encounter many unexpected problems,and working in a team allows them to watch and learn each other's trategies in coping with various problems.
8.0	which will develop their problem soving skills and boost their ability to learn.
8.0	Therefor woking as a part of team provides students with more chances to learn form each other and promote their talents.
5.0	Admittedly woking together can have one or two downsides  for instance,due to lack of unaimous understanding about some problems.
9.0	students usually do not come up with brilliant ideas at the begining and there could bea  big waste of time and energy .
9.0	at such age students tend to hang out and play instead of foucing on their work when they are palce together.
3.0	It‘s universally acknowleged that grades generally represent  a student's capcity nowadys.,which naturally detemines his future.
3.0	Hence,for the sake of improving chidren's grades ,many parents incline to offer mony as rewards if children can reach higher score.
3.0	From my point of view, it goes without any doubt that it's not an ideal solution.
11.0	Reasons are listed as follow.
6.0	First of all, contant encourage with money sets up bad values for chidren, leading to that they can be urged only by money ultimately.
8.0	Have this happened, it will have profound impact on chidren's future, which can be asserted bad for them.
8.0	Futhermore, it's parents' obligation to let children know that study is for themselves and they need to be responsible for his prospect.
8.0	If children are cultivated in this circumstance, they will feel it's parents who drive them to learn and it's parents that are responsible for their future.
8.0	Last but not least, it's better for students to get absorbed in study by interest rather than by money.
8.0	Only with deep interest in learning, can chidren walk father and be eminent.
2.0	To put it in a nutshell, money shouldn't be a main measure parents take to improve children's grades as soon as poosible.
9.0	Patience and love are more necessary for children's growth and learning.
9.0	Therefore, always spare enough time to company your childrem in order to cultivate their interest in study.
3.0	Some people think that the opinions of famous people such as entertainers and athletes are more important to older people than are to younger people.
11.0	However I have different idea, when it comes to the statement that the opinions of celebrities are more importants to younger people than are to older people, I totally agree.
10.0	I will provide two example to illustrate that.
5.0	Firstly, younger people are more easily influenced by opinions of celebrities because they have not enough of value judgement.
8.0	When people were young age, they will be easily attracted by either well-package entertainers or successful athletes.
8.0	The major reason is that those person always show their positive aspection to public so that young people will regard them as their idols.
8.0	Within this society that message spread out quickly, young person can konw their idol's view and statement quickly.
8.0	As a result, receiving idol's opinions has become a habbit and  become more and more important for young people who without enough value judgment that help them make their own decision about what they heard about and what they saw.
5.0	Secondly, older people are always contain their own idea about the society and not easily change mind.
9.0	Old people ususally older than those celebrities has their own experience and thought about the world and always think other younger person know less than them which will result of forming a durable habbit that do not like to receive other's idea even without thinking.
9.0	That's a key reason for why old people do not think the opinions of celebrities is not important for them.
2.0	Lastly the age deceide how much things you have experienced and saw in society whcih also deterimine that the way for treat with other people's opinion and thoughts.
11.0	With our life becoming more and more complex, people always want to have a spiritual being to lead them to walk out of darkness.
11.0	Celebrities are such a kind of person to guide them.
11.0	However those people will be more important to younger people than they are to older prople.
10.0	younger people have less experience to go through difficulties and their are more easily  to love the celebrities and learn from them.
6.0	To begin with, younger people don't have many skills to deal with the difficulties like older people so they need those celebrities to give them advice or an examle to help them.
8.0	Take me as an example, when i was in high school, the tasks in school were too difficult for me to handle and i always gave up while i met with some tough problems.
8.0	However, i came across a book talking about Taylor swift who goes through all difficulties and finally succeed in becoming a singer everyone like.
8.0	A thought suddenly come to my mind:I should be as brave as Taylor to solve those problems.
8.0	After that, i started to study hard and solve the problems no matter how difficult they were.
8.0	At last, i came to the best university in my town.
8.0	Younger people will always need a guidence to help them but Older people will be more skillful to solve those problem because they have more experience that young people and they don't need to have celebrities to support them.
7.0	Besides, younger people will be easier to be influenced by the celebrities than older people and they are tend to love those people to
3.0	In such a highly competitive society, most people have to work very hard hard in order to make a better life.
12.0	However, with the accompany with the heavy workload, it's unaviodable for workers getting bored, and the efficiency will decrease if they have no passion with the work, so we have to change the working pattern.
11.0	And I agree with the statement that if workers can do different work during their working time they can be very satisfied.
12.0	And I have three reasons for my position.
5.0	First, different work have different interesting point.
8.0	No matter how funny one works are, or how interested you with one work, you cannot maintain a highly efficiency all the time.
8.0	But if you keep trying many knids of new things, you can always maintain a highly concentrated state, This is not only good for your work, but also can help you stay satisfied  all the time, even when you get home, you can still be active, don't feel tired when you played with your son, or telling stories to your daughter.
8.0	Different things have different characteristics, and if you can go through all these things everyday, you will feel satisfied with your whole life.
5.0	Second, different work also contain different knowledges.
8.0	Actually human body is an amazing machine, it has unlimited potential, and the brain can always accept different knowledges.
8.0	However, whole-day works can close the door of accepting fashion things, because our brain have already been filling up with one thing.
8.0	So if we do many different types of tasks during the workday, we can know many knids of knowledges.
7.0	For example, if you are a electric welder, but you were order to weld many shapes of still opr many styles of archetect
11.0	Nowadays more and more people are willing to participate in the govenment policy which determine the future society.
11.0	Young people are also included in and play an important role.
11.0	So, in my view, young people do have some influence on the social decisions.
6.0	Admittedly, young people may be too young to have a positive effect on the decisions because some of them cannot tell right from wrong.
8.0	Since they are young, their experience are not enough to support them to make a good decision and sometimes they only see the disadvantages or advantages on someting but cannot combine that.
8.0	Moreover some bad guys will make ues of young people to support their wrong opinion or their own purposes because young people, lacking of experience ,are easily persuaded.
8.0	Due to those negative effect, young people may be ignored when the society is making some decision.
1.0	However young people still play an important role in the community and what the future society become is depend on them.
1.0	So young people's opinion will never be ignored.
10.0	For instance, considering about the problems of education, young people's opinion are the most important since they are now facing the problems.
7.0	And the decision people maked will definetely consid
3.0	People nowadays have more stress on work or study; thus, folks are trying to find approaches to release pressure and relax.
3.0	Some of them prefer watching movies or reading books than doing physical exercise.
11.0	From my perspective, it is incorrect and not appropriate.
5.0	Relaxing includes both mental and physical comfort.
9.0	According to people's experience, watching and reading are easy to get tired mentally.
9.0	When they finish the process, it only brings more exhaust feelings
5.0	Besides, doing physical exercise is a healthier way to relax than the other one.
8.0	Watching and reading could cause eyesight problems.
8.0	The former brings radiation to our eyes; especially when attracted in  movies for a long time, people often feel dry on eyes.
8.0	If the situation continues for  some time, they are about to lose their eyesight.
8.0	The latter may have less effect on people's eyes, but is still harmful; especially when they dont sit properly, not only their eyes but their vertebration is going to be hurt badly.
2.0	As what mentioned before, doing physical exercise is more effective and more appropriate than watching and reading.
10.0	It's even better with some music around.
3.0	Recently, there is a heated discussion about the modern young people have no influence on the important decisions.
12.0	Some people believe that the those young too naive, because they have not so many amazing ideas.
12.0	However, other hold dissimilar viewpoint that the modern people have special power to solve different problems.
11.0	As for me, I agree with latter one idea.
12.0	My reasons and examples are listed as follows.
5.0	One reason why I am in favor of my perspective is that the modern young people have more creative and active, because with the science and technology development, our lifes were changed all the time.
8.0	It is east to say, most young people today  are very clever and have their own ideas, because recent years, the phones and computers are developed very quickly, which means the young people can learn knowledge easily.
8.0	A good example of this is my friend Tom, he just a university student, but he can solve many problems which most adults cannot solve.
8.0	He learned to make internet page, and has made lots of beautiful web sites, which even his teacher cannot to make, so many international companies want to hire him.
8.0	As the example suggests, the young people today can creat different things.
5.0	Another relevant reason used to support my opinion is that the modern young people have better health, so they can finish works quickly but use less time.
8.0	This is due to the fact that young people can eat more healthy food, and their live environment much better than before.
8.0	Atypical illustration of this can be seen in my cousin Peter and his father.
8.0	In fact, Peter's father and Peter are good at repair different things like TV , computers.
8.0	But he is too old, so Peter can work much faster, and finish with high quality.
10.0	In concluision, that' s why I chjoose
3.0	Nowadays, with thecountinuous development of society more and more get rich.
12.0	so they have a lot oflifestyles.
11.0	Many people like to travel.
11.0	they think traveling in own country is better than from traveling foreign countries.
11.0	while others believe thant traveling to reign countrires is beteer than own country. l strongly agree.
12.0	Because traveling from foreign countries people can open mind and also can improve language skill.
5.0	First of all, when we traveling foreign countries people can open mind.
8.0	Because we can learn some different culture and custom.
8.0	For example, last year my firends go to spain, after she come back she tell me thespaimsh usually eat dinner is very late.
8.0	while if people just travelingown country they were didn't know about this custom.
8.0	Because when people traveling in own country they usually look at the scenery and release the pressure.
8.0	And also when people traveling foreign countries they can learn some different history, after they come back they can collect lot of date.
5.0	Second, traveling to foreign countries can improve us language skill that this will be of gret help to our future work.
9.0	There is a good example from own country celebrity famous person Jack ma,  when he go to the America, he collect a lot of internet knowledge, when he come back chinahe created alibab.
9.0	because he has a good English language abillty so he can touch some foreiners.
7.0	So, who have a good language skills they can touch different person
11.0	I think it is a good idea for parents to offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.
12.0	And here are my opinions.
11.0	First of all, parents should know that there is nothing more important than their children's study.
12.0	Parents can not only choose offer a little money to encourage their children to study, but also arise their children for all their lifetime.
11.0	It's obvious that encouraging their children to study and learning more skills are better.
11.0	This fact should be known by more parents.
5.0	Second, the praise of money can make children more willing to study and get a better grade.
8.0	"For example, the children will perfer a toy praise to some words like ""you're great!"" when they get a good grade."
8.0	Ang they will do better to get more money praise.
8.0	The study is no longer a boring thing for them.
5.0	And last but not least, the children will know that if they want to get some thing, they must try their best.
8.0	This concious is really important for children when they grow.
8.0	Compared with the children who never get money praise from their parents, the children who always get money for their good grades better know that what they have done are meaningful, and they reserve it.
8.0	Only to try their best can they get what they want.
0.0	Although someone may think it will make children to get a wrong attitude with studying, I still think parents offering their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school is a good idea.
0.0	The advantages are more than the disadvantages.
0.0	But parents should also know that it's not right to give their children too much money, they are still children.
12.0	I think the viewpoint that parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes is down two paths.
12.0	Because of the children's growth,their experience,their value,their view of life will have changed a lot.
12.0	Thus,parents should keep up with the times and the transformations.
6.0	The most significant factor to demand the chilren is observing the children whether maturity in spirit.
8.0	For the person who in a low age,the parents should often check out their mistakes and point out them.
8.0	At that period,the child have not standard to the right and wrong.
8.0	As a consequence,they may making mass and do something incorrect.
8.0	The parents need patience treating your student though they  After their rebellious stage,the parents  still need to educate the children because they don't have a vision of the futrue.
8.0	Their  parents have much experience of life which can direct their baby.
9.0	When the person have a whole value of his or her life,just let him go.
9.0	At that time,they still make many mistakes,but the mistake will became the stepping-stone of theirselves.
7.0	If you change th
11.0	I think it is a wise strategy that some parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.
5.0	Firstly,as for a large propotion of school-age children,it is boring to go to school everyday.
10.0	It is a new and powerful motiviation to  offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school, which can effectively cultivate their interests in monotonous knowledge.
5.0	Secondly, dreams and goals are invisible, but money is specific and practical.
8.0	"The children can use the ""award"" given by parents when they get  each high grade in school to pay for things they like, such as  shoping, playing computer games, going to movies and so on."
8.0	In this way,this money can equilibrate their study and life out of school.
8.0	Because good scores and c
12.0	The workers have the tasks everyday,maybe their leader will order them to do something different tasks everyday,or do the samething for repeating,i agree that the different types of  missions for the workers.
5.0	First of all,do the same tasks all day long may can motivate the efficiency of the workers,they were familiar of their works,and there has no any challenges ,though they can release the propablities of mistakes.
8.0	But i think doing the different types of tasks can impromt the workers to having more incentive about the jobs,they will motivated by the challenges,they won't feel boring when they are doing works,though the qualities of works may improves,it will brings many benefit for the factories of the companies.
8.0	While the were get more chanllenges they won't boring ,and be fun,it will help the physical healthey of the workers On the other side,having the different types of tasks during the workday will motivate the creatives of the workers,they may having some great ideas when they encounter the barriers,because of if they were bond with the difficulties,they will try to find some solutions to solve the problems,then in this process,the workers can improved about the problem solutions,in the history,many great ideas are occurs in the way of solving problems.
8.0	If the method help the workers to be great,it also was a good news for his companies.
5.0	Thirds,having different types of missons will cultivate the spirit of solving,the worker won't avoid the barriers when they having problems,they will not be afraid of them,if they were freathened they can't do anything in the futures.
9.0	The different types of missons can let them know how to defeat the problems,and the most is the workers know how to be confident,they are the workers who do not afraid the difficulties.
9.0	Any companies do not want to employed the unuseable staff,they need the workers who was great from their inside.
2.0	In conclusions,the workers should be satisfied about have many different types,this is the best method of helping them to improve.
3.0	With the increasingly rapid pace of life,a growing number of individuals show an inclination to relax by reading books,.
12.0	Whether it is a better option is discussed heatedly currently.
12.0	As far as I am concermed relax by doing  physical exercise outweights relax by reading books or watching movie,for the following reason.
12.0	First of all,doing exercise can bring us a good mood,so,it can improve our working efficiency.
12.0	As the statistic from Boston University show,85 percents people will feel relaxed after doing exercise.
8.0	The opposite side, 90 percents of people who relax by watching movies donot really feel great after they finish watching movies for the story may not developed as what they want.
8.0	Secondly,doing exercises is good for our body,and of corse we can have a lot of energy doing our work.
8.0	The opposite side,The opposite side,reading books is not helpful to our body.
6.0	Therefore,from my point of view,iI maintain that relax by doing exercise is far better the relax by reading books or watching movies.
10.0	And some scientists have illustrated the balancebet
3.0	In order to learn from the past, some school required all the studens to take history class no matter what their field of study is.
3.0	Is it really nessecery for all the students to learn history?
11.0	I don't think so.
11.0	I believe that although history is really useful, we shouldn't force our students to learn it.
4.0	First, studying history can't benifit all the students in all the fields.
8.0	For example, I am students in the physic fields, but I don't think that history can do anything with my major subject.
8.0	I didn't take any history classes in my school and I don't regret on my choice.
8.0	Instead I use all my time to learn something in my field.
8.0	It is neccessary for a student to study one thing at one time so that he can get to the top of his studies.
8.0	Learning history can waste his time and energy.
4.0	Second, some students don't like history so that they can't focus on this subject.
8.0	Although many people told me that history sometimes are really funny, this can't change my attitude towards this subject, boring and tiring.
8.0	To be honest, I am totally not interested in history.
8.0	Imagine that if you force a student who is just dislike history to take lessons, that is terrible.
8.0	We shouldn't require all the students to take classes that they don't like.
4.0	Third, learning history needs a lot of time.
8.0	It looks like this reason makes no sense, but this is true.
8.0	If we want to learn history well, we have to use a lot of time to memorize.
8.0	As for me, this point is a credit one because like most students I am bad at memorizing.
8.0	If I want to get a better score, I have to remember everything in the textbook and in the notes.
8.0	If Iwant to do well in this subject, certainly I can have extra time to spend on the things I liked.
1.0	To make a conclusion, there are many reasons to allowing childrens to learn what they likes.
1.0	If we require all the students to take history classes for no reason, some students might be disappointed.
12.0	I agree that parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.
8.0	Many people will make mistakes and making mistakes is not a shame things for us.
8.0	When I was studying in middle school and I always made a same mistakes in a improtant point.
8.0	However, my teacher didn't critise me and left me a lot of time to think about this point and then tell her why I make this mistakes.
8.0	Through this way I won't make the same mistakes again in genral.
8.0	So I believe that making mistakes is a good things for us to realize our setback and make up for our shortcomings.
8.0	And parents should let children make mistakes, ranther than protect them from makeing mistakes.
8.0	If you do so, not only let your children lose a chance to take adventure but also lose a good way to learn new things.
8.0	What is more, as a parents, I think that they need to make their children konw that making miatakes is a good star rather than a bad ending.
8.0	To do so, your children will never be afraid of making mistakes and they maybe will be willing to try to something which looks like different.
8.0	Your children will becoming more outgong and confidence from their own mistakes.
8.0	Finally, in my opinion, leaning from their own mistakes also is a improtant thing for children.
8.0	Beacuse I thnik that everyone has different mistakes, and our mistakes is belongs to ourselves.
8.0	Thus learn from your own mistakes is a most useful way to themselves to find out their shortcoming, which parents couldn't help them to solve.
8.0	If you help them and the mistakes is useless.
2.0	All in all,  parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes is a good thing.
10.0	Parents should have try to let your children make mistakes.
11.0	As we can see in our daily life, the relatioship bewteen parents and children are complicated, and the reasons may lie in the different conspects of something they think.
3.0	Let us discuss the following situation.
12.0	If children make some mistakes, should parents forgive them as well as allow them to learn from the mistakes.
6.0	Some parents argue that it is human nature to do something wrong at the first time, as they don't clearly understand it and practice before, As the saying goes, there is always the first time, we don't need to worry about what they have done, what truly matters is what they learn from it.
8.0	It can be an impressing way for them to broaden their horizons and have a dood command what they shouldn't do.
8.0	These parents will give another chance to their childion to correct it and encourage them to face the mistakes objectively.
8.0	On the contrary, others suppose that children shouldn't make mistakes, they will make the same mistake again if they made it before.
8.0	For instance, smoking, one can hardly get rid of it even if he or she just trys it out of curiosity.
8.0	They are strongly against their children doing something wrong.
2.0	As far as I am concerned, Parents shoula let children make mistakes.
10.0	For
3.0	Do you parents give you money when you get the good grades at school?
3.0	Are you very motivate after you gain these money?
12.0	I think the answer is very clear that the school-age children will ne very cheerful and they want to get good grades in the next test.
11.0	Moreover they will learn some valuable things like if a person want to gain soemthing, he must make effort.
11.0	So for this opinion, I think it is a good idea.
5.0	Firstly, if parents give the children some money after they get good grades, they will feel very happy and they will work harder in the next test because the encourage thing--money.
8.0	Take my brother as an example, he is a high school student and he is very busy for whole day but he do not have much motivate to study harder.
8.0	This is because, he do not have some ambitions like to be a top student in their class or get good grades to prove himself.
8.0	One day his parents told him that if he can have a progress in the middle term exam, he can gain one thousand yuan.
8.0	He is shaking by this massage because one thousand is a big money for a high school student.
8.0	Thus, he finds the target of him, the one thousand of money; during the time when he prepar to the test, the only thing in his mind is study.
8.0	In the past, he can be disturbed very easily but after he have the motivation, he pay all his attention on the study.
8.0	Finally, he get very good grades in this test that is the highest grade in all test he has done.
8.0	So give the money will bring gigantic motivate to the children and for this target they will try their best to work hard for it.
5.0	Second, they also will learn how to manage these money they get and this ability will bring a lot of benefit to their future.
9.0	With the development of the society, it is very necessary to gain the ability that spend the money reasonable.
9.0	These children can use the money they gain to buy something they want or just collect them in their band cards.
7.0	All of this will teach them to use the money more efficient and buy the things the
12.0	Nowadays,there are more people prefer to relax by watching a movie or reading a book rather than taking exercise,because they think it is an old-fashioned approach to relax by taking exercise.
12.0	In my oninion,taking exercise still  play an essential role in our lives .
4.0	First and foremost,health is the most vital factor for people to live.
9.0	People are able to strengthen their power to make themselves healthier by taking exercise.
9.0	However,if people just stay in theatre to see a movie,they might be uncomfortable due to the long-term rediation.
4.0	Furthermore,it is an effective manner for people to broaden their horizon by coming out and doing exercise.
8.0	For example,I always go out to take exercise,once I met a lot of friends who also take the same exercise as me and we comunucated with each others a lot.
8.0	Therefore I made many new friends by taking exercise.
8.0	In contrast,if I just stay at to read a book ,I will never make so many friends and improve my communication skills.
4.0	Finally,there could be some stressful student who would like to relax but without sufficient money to watch movie or buy book.
9.0	Therefore,the best way to relax themselves without much charge is taking exercise.
9.0	Because they just need to get out of their house and do any sports they want.
1.0	To sum  up,it is more beneficial to take exercise than to watch a movie or read a book for relaxation.
1.0	If people were stressful ,why not choose to take exercise to lower the pressure?
3.0	Many concerned about social skills in dealing with friendship.
3.0	some people think that the abillity to maintain friendships with  a small number of people last a long period of time is more important for happiness than  the abllility to make many new friends easily.
3.0	however , i hold the oppsite persipective, i think maintaining friendship with a small number of people over a long period of time is requsted more patience , feelings, social skills.
11.0	however, making new friends does not need these.
6.0	firstly,during long period of  maintaining friendships ,you maybe have conficts with your firends sometimes, because you are faimilar with each other, you  konw what they like and want they dislike.
8.0	so in the conficts,it is easier to hurt your frineds' feeling.
8.0	that we called that we  need more patient to maintain this freindship.
8.0	in addtion, if  you have some unhappy things with your new friends and they are not impotant to you.
8.0	i think that does not matter.
8.0	Bacause you cann not need to care about their feeling and  can just  make anthoer new friends.
8.0	i think that's easier for me to do so.
2.0	in conclusion,the abillity to maintain friendships with  a small number of people last a long period of time is more important for happiness than  the abllility to make many new friends easily.
7.0	you can have less responsilblity to maintain the friendship o
3.0	What type of career of job can pave you a way toward a successful future?
11.0	I have no reason for this question because this period become more risky and has more opportunities.
11.0	Obviously, it is easier that I identify what type of career is the best.
5.0	In the first place, that information cannot widely quick transfer cover a lot of promillent.
8.0	For instance, Monet's painting become famous after he died long time ago.
8.0	Even he didn't know how good he is painted because he live in an original society.
8.0	They had not televition or telephone or internet.
8.0	Thus, he could not let more people approach his draws.
8.0	Maybe in his viewpoints, he was just a poor painter and a loser as he had not any money.
8.0	Although we think his career is very brilliant because he created such famous masters, he thought his job is highly common and terrible because he cannot make money and this job cannot help him gain fame.
8.0	In the past, we can easier defect one job is normal or excellent due to the point that there is less people find your intelligence.
5.0	Secondly, people who lived in the past are limited in the emotion so they can easier judge one career or job.
8.0	As we know, the education lever in the past is higly important because you get a nice job by you high education.
8.0	However, in the recent society, the education lever is not such exaggerative in the past.
8.0	The opportunity in this day is equal for everyone.
8.0	For instance.
8.0	The Chinese famous merchant, Ma Yun, does not have high education.
8.0	Nevertheless, he never give up himself because he believe that if he persist, he will achieves his goal in the futher.
8.0	He set up his own electron company and he has further view.
8.0	Finally, his efforts paid off.
7.0	To sum up, I agree with the point that we cannot evaluate one job
7.0	nowaday  as there are more oppo
11.0	I think it is a good idea to give them students money for their school live.
12.0	Well, not all grades maybe.
11.0	Firstly, it is obvious that some students cannot get their work, or in other word, job, during their school times, especially primary school.
12.0	They may get some pocket money by working for their neighbours, but I can say they certainly could not afford their fees for going to school.
8.0	To state it more clearly, as for in America, a boy can get $35 for his excellent job in sweeping the garden, or cutting the weeds.
8.0	So it is easily to see that how can a such little boy afford his expensive fees?
8.0	Before they get their job, I think it is their parents' responsibility to give them money to go to school.
5.0	Secondly, I would like to say that it is cruel to see their kids working terribly hard outside, just for their fees to go to school.
8.0	If their parents have ability, then why not give them a hand?
8.0	We can compare a kid with an adult, their forces are different, adults' are high, kids' are low.
8.0	Sometimes a simple thing for adults is a hardest task for children.
8.0	When they grow up and have the enough force to take care of themselves, they shall reward you for your given hands for them making them adults.
5.0	Lastly, giving them a hand on money can make them concentrated on their studies, which is more important than earning money for their fees.
8.0	We can simply think over about it---- if parents make them centered on their schoolwork, they may probably get better grades, then with the fabulous grade, they would get a better job.
8.0	At last, a good job can just produce more money.
8.0	What is more, parents and their children shall get closer.
8.0	The kid would be grateful with the given hand on his fees, and he would rewands with more money.
8.0	So why not give them a hand?
0.0	In conclusion, I think it is cruel not to help them with their fee to go to school.
0.0	Children can be independent, but that is the matter after they grow up.
0.0	How can we deny that children's smiles are the most beautiful?
7.0	What parents do, will simply influ
3.0	Now days, parents are espicially concern their children's grades.
3.0	So they use many ways to encourage their children to improve their grades.
3.0	When their children get high grade, they will offer their chidren money.
11.0	Although this may have some effect on improving children's grade, but i think it is not a good way in the long time.
4.0	Firstly, improving the grade in such kind of way is not the ture purpose of the study.
8.0	The real purpose for the children to get higher grade should be the desire to improve themselives.
8.0	Today, people who has better ability to study is more likely to have brighter future.
8.0	So it is very improtant for parents to help their children develop the ability of study.
8.0	But use money to sitimulate their children to study will not reach our ture goal of helping children develop the ability of study.
4.0	In addition, young children is too young to hold large amount of momney.
8.0	If parents offer their schoo-age children for each high grade, the children may have large amount of money in hand.
8.0	So it is high possible that the children may use these money to do things that are not relative with study.
8.0	This practice may let children have bad habits of spending money.
4.0	However, it is neccesery for parents to offer gifts for encourage their children.
8.0	Because sometimes study with encouragement can have better result of grade.
8.0	But there are many other channels for the parents to chosse.
8.0	For example, books, foods and maybe a chance of travel.
8.0	These channels are all better than offering money.
0.0	To sum up, the grade is important indeed, but parents should not use the wrong way.
0.0	Even many adluts can not avoid the induce of money, what about young children?
0.0	So parents should offer more stablly channels instead of money.
3.0	Currently, it is a common practice that parents tend to offer their school-age children some money as a way of encouraging them to get high grades.
3.0	Some people hold the view that it is good for their children because they will have better academic performance; others, though, are skeptical, arguing that it is of no benefit for children by doing so.
11.0	From  my perspective, I am firmly convinced that there are more disadvantages because it can mislead children and it may cause bad consequence.
5.0	First of all, awarding chirdren by giving money may put false ideas into children's minds.
8.0	As we all know, we go to school to gain knowleadge for ourseves instead of pursuing money from parents, and offering money will not give children such ideas.
8.0	To name a few, my brother's parents used to give him a large sum of money when he did well in school.
8.0	It seems to work in the beginning, however, as time went by, my brother developed a bad habit in the end.
8.0	He would not study untill his parents give him money so it is no doubt that he failed his exam in the end.
8.0	It is obvious that offering children money have bad influence.
5.0	Secondly, offering children money may not help them in their school work, and what makes matter worse,it may lead to bad results in the end.
8.0	When receiving money from parents after hard work for a time, children are easily addicted to using their money randamly.
8.0	For example, when my brother had money, he is more willing to use the money to relax himself rather than continue to studying hard.
8.0	With time going by, he gradually fall behind others at school.
8.0	So he would not get money, which inturn lead to his unwillingness to study.
8.0	There is no denying that he had no alternative but to fail many exams.
8.0	It is apparent that offering children money is not a good idea.
1.0	In conclusion, I am not in favor of the idea of giving chirdren money when they get high grade at school.
1.0	By doing so, parents will put incorrect ideas into children's minds and it may result in bad consequences in the end.
11.0	In my views,  I don't agree with thi statement.
3.0	Ithink we have read more and more news about that some people have trapped in trouble and  there is no one to help them.
11.0	in that ways, the  people who want to help struggling stangers are decreasing.
11.0	There are many reasons to support my opinion.
5.0	First, several yeas ago, Nanjing has occurred a controvatial case.
8.0	An oldder accused that a young man has knocked her down and asked for the conpensitive money.
8.0	When people criticized the young man, he explained that he didn't do it and he had helped the odder out of the trap.
8.0	Next, he showed lots of evidences.
8.0	At that time, people turned into support him and stated that the odder was a liar for money.
8.0	However, at last, the odder won the case.
8.0	Publics were angry with the consequence and said that this example would decrease the willing of helping strangers.
8.0	In a famous news website has made a reaserch about this event, and the result showed that more than 50% interviewers didn't want to help struggling people any more.
8.0	this things made people think whether helping other can bring benefits for themselves and whether it would hurt themselve instead.
8.0	Under this kind of consideration, people have to analysis the risk  of helping strangers and are easy to miss the opportunities to help others.
5.0	Second, people are tend to follow the large part of publics.
8.0	If there is no one tries to help struggling people, others will wait or look by.
8.0	But at the same time, it's hard to be the first one to do one thing.
8.0	So if someone need help, others prefer not to help and think that maybe others will give the favor.
10.0	\ALL inall, people don't like to h
3.0	As much as people differ, their way of relaxing differs as well.
3.0	The way to easing oneslef of their troubles is as diversed as the problem itself.
3.0	For that particular reason, one might say that it wil be impossible to rate one type of exercise over the other.
12.0	But as an indivisual with what few years of experience i've had in my live, i would have to agree with this statement of sitting down and relaxing over being physically active.
4.0	Not much people can argue that it is easier to find a place to sit and be quiet than it is to discover a wide area to move around and get worked up in these jungles of builings modern people live in nowadays.
8.0	True, one can go out into the rural areas to find one's true self and relax while trying to stay in shape.
8.0	But to be honest, that only happens once in a long time for no one can find that much time at hand to go.
8.0	Considering the stress evels of people today, it will be nice to be relaxed when one lands home from work so they can shake off their loads and be carefree.
8.0	How better to accomplish such feat than to just sail into the land of a dynamic book or epic movie.
8.0	They are quick to access, and efficient when one needs to just   chill.
4.0	One might say that i, personally, is indeed fond of comfort.
8.0	Soft rugs, aromatic coffee, comforting cuisines are all one my top list of things that will make me stay in good mood.
8.0	What better to accompany these with but a nice book or a touching movie?
8.0	All of the above can take one one an epic journey without having one to leave thier own homes.
8.0	May i point out the sofisticated language of many novels, and the pearls of wisdom that are hidden within are more than enough to make one want to pick them up, comfort or not.
4.0	No matter how relaxing it is to watch a movie when one needs relaxing, it cannot be said that doing exercise does not help.
8.0	After all, one have to admitt that exercising does help release anger and keeps one healthy.
8.0	It is also said that it can help with deppression, and other symptomes of the human body.
8.0	However, that is just not the way i usually choose to relax, and the energy spend on such task draggs onto me afterwards, and i get so sweaty, that i would not want to do so.
1.0	To me, reading is the best way to elysium.
1.0	It is quick and accessable to people like me who live in the more urban areas, such as a cosmopolitan, and the after effects are more easily dealt with.
3.0	At present, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among students: whether it is as important for the elderly to learn new things as it is for young people.
3.0	Answers vary from one to another.
3.0	Some people claim that it's unnecessary for old people to learn new things since their learning ability is not as well as  that of young people.
11.0	However, contrary to their views comes my own perspective that old people are required to learn new things as well.
11.0	My viewpoint is based on the following reasons.
5.0	First, learning new things can perfect old people's work and study ability.
8.0	To be more specific,old people also need to work and with the quick development of technology, the working way of people have varied a lot by using kinds of high-tech such as various Internet technique.
8.0	Thus, having a  understanding of some innovative technology could enlarge old people's horizon.
8.0	In this way, the working ability of the old peoplecould be promoted.
8.0	However, if old people didn't want to accept some new technique, they might be ruled out for their working ability and efficiency is much lower than those who have a good command of innovative techiques.
8.0	For example, my uncle who is over 60 years old still works in a bank.
8.0	After the widespread of computer system of keeping accounts in the bank, my uncle had to learn how to use office softwares to handle his daily issues.
8.0	After several years' practice, he is as skillful as his younger colleague and he always tells me a joke that he is still young.
5.0	Second, studying new things could also help the elder have a closer connection with younger people.
8.0	Specifically, it is widely acknowledged that young people can quickly accept and learn new things such as some newly invented words.
8.0	If older people refuse to use and learn these new things, chances are that there will exists deeper and larger gaps between the younger and the older.
8.0	Young people might not want to speak with old people for they think the old are out of date.
8.0	Under this circumstance, old people should learn some new things and catch up with new trends in order not to be left banind by the younger.
8.0	For example, my dad always asks me about some new trends of the Internet.
8.0	Sometimes I even get fed up with his constant questions.
8.0	And after a while, I learn that he just wants to have more common interest and topics with me.
8.0	Thanks to my dad' s persistent learning , there is always harmonious atmosphere beween us.
2.0	In conclusion, it is as critical for the old to study new things as it is for younger people for learning new things can not only perfert their own learing ability but also stimulate the elderly to have closer relationship with the young people.
3.0	Nowadays, more and more people realize the importance of young people and pay attention to them.
12.0	Most of the people are appealing the school and parents to develop children's independence.
11.0	Some people think that nowdays, young people still have to make decisions rely on their parents, just like the past.
11.0	However, I think young people now  are more independent and really have the ability to make decisions by themselves.
4.0	Firstly, in the advanced society, young people can get much more information than before.
8.0	For one thing, they have more choices.
8.0	Through the internet and the computer, they can easily get to know what they like and what they want., and make their own decisions.
8.0	For example, my mother used to told me stories about her childhood.
8.0	My mother lived in  a small country when she was a child.
8.0	Every time she want to buy a new clothes, she had to describe what kind of clothes she like to her parents.
8.0	And then, after her parents have the chance to the city, they would based on my mother's describition and made the the decision to buy which clothes.
8.0	But now because of the internet, I just need to enter the online shop and I will see almost all kinds of clothes.
8.0	I can decide which one to buy only by myself.
8.0	I don't need to rely on parents like past.
4.0	Secondly, more and more people are not worried by the enconmical problems now.
8.0	Young people also don't need to consider too much for their parents.
8.0	There are enough money for them to do things they want.
8.0	For example, my father's parents are farmers.
8.0	Everyday my father had to depend on my grandparents to decide what food he can eat today.
8.0	Because my grandparents grew oranges, so my father can only eat oranges everyday as his breakfast.
8.0	He can't depend on himself to make decision, because he had no money.
8.0	But now it is totally different.
8.0	I can enjoy almost all kinds of food as my breakfast, such as noodels, rice, dumplings and so on.
8.0	It is because I have the enough money to support me to do that.
4.0	Thirdly, for people who in the past, these people's thoughts are much more old.
8.0	They were under their parents' mangement everyday.
8.0	They didn't dare to make their own decision.
8.0	For example, my uncle was afraid of my grandpa when he was young.
8.0	So he used to have a chance to play guitar, but because my grandpa's disagreement, he gave up the chance.
8.0	But I can do it now and my parents support me now.
8.0	We have a new mind now.
1.0	Because people now have much more money, much more information and much more free thoughts.
1.0	I think young people now are more depend on themselves to make decisions.
3.0	With the development of economic and science, it provides people to enjoy the life, which contributes much for them to living in the modern society that full of pressure and intensity.
3.0	Some people prefer to live a easy and quite lives to relax by watching a movie or reading a book.
3.0	As an old saying'enyoy your lives with cultures with an slower speed.'
3.0	They think that movie and book not only can expand your brain, but also can ease your bodies and mind, deepen your spirits.
3.0	Aditionally, you can watch movies and read books at anywhere in anytime.
11.0	It is more convinient for you to relax yourselves.
6.0	However, some others wolud like do some physical exercise rather than watch movies or read books.
8.0	In their opinions, relax yourselves, firstly, relax your bodies.
8.0	Doing exerses offers many benefits to one's physicical processeces.
8.0	It is not only provides your relaxation, but also can shape your bodies and make you look like more healier.
8.0	Moreover, exerces help people utilze their leisure time more constructively.
8.0	People can gain more motor skills, like jogging, playing balls and so on.
8.0	Besides, doing exercise can make more friends, you can do exercise with your friends, to  increase your communication.
0.0	As far as I am concerned, I would like both of doing exercises and watching movies or reading books.
0.0	Doing exercise can relax my body and decline my pressure and disappotment, also, I can communicate with my friends when doing exercise.
0.0	The others can ease my mood and spirit.
3.0	It's known to all that our world is no longer outdated, there are many advanced technologies such as the Internet, the maglev train applied in daily life.
3.0	Views went differ when it comes to the problem that is it important for governments to spend money to improve Internet access than to improve public transportation?
11.0	In my opinion, I think they are both worth spending money.
5.0	On the one had, the Internet makes mordern life more convenient.
8.0	Since more and more bussinessmen have the online shop, people can buy things without stepping outside.
8.0	This area is worthy of government investment, becuse poeple can observed the unlimited financial potential apparently.
8.0	For example, Jack Ma's e-commerce cooperation lead China's economy to increase, my consin is now working an individual bussiness, she sell her clothes through the internet and earn more than the job she used to do.
8.0	So if the government could spend money improve the internet, more people will benefit from it.
5.0	On the other hand, transportations make it easier for people to travel to the place they wanted.
8.0	There is a ducumentary called Amazing China, it discirbe the development of the railway.
8.0	Through the railway, many poor farmers can not only afford their children to get better educated but also earn their life by the tourism because the transportation is widespead and acts as a bridge that bring the world closer.
8.0	Fuether more, the subway is also an advanced thchnology that makes city life faster.
1.0	Conclusively, the improvement on Internet and transportation are both equally important for government.
1.0	They are the parts that are indespensible in people's life.
3.0	The types of works are always concerned by workers.
3.0	And there is a heat discussion about which way can make workers more delighted: Doing different tasks or doing similar tasks during a day.
11.0	On the one hand, doing the same tasks may help people take more time on one particular problem and have more chanes to solve it.
12.0	On the other hand, doing different tasks has its benefits for workers as well.
11.0	From my perspective, i would prefer the later one and there are some reasons below.
4.0	Firstly, it can equip us with more skills.
8.0	If you do similar tasks all day, you can only take advantages on one particular skill, you do not have other different skills to do more things.
8.0	However, various skills are always useful if you are changed to another job or position and you may start to do a whole new thing.
8.0	Therefore, your old skill does not practical that much.
8.0	In addition, you must spend your energy and time on learning new skiils while you can already equipped with them when you are trying to do various tasks.
8.0	You will be regretted at that time, then why not do as different tasks as you can now?
4.0	Moreover, it helps me save my time and leads to a high quality result.
8.0	Different things to do always can refresh your mind for you do not to have to bury yourself in same tasks.
8.0	Thus everytime you get refreshed you can get yourself into a better mood to do the task well.
8.0	For example, once i had a lot of homeworks, but i only had one day to finish it.
8.0	I started to do maths during the first hour, and in the second hour i nearly wanted to fall asleep for i has already do the maths for an hour.
8.0	So i changed to Physics, also changed to another thing method to clean my mind.
8.0	As a result, i fiished my homework in the just three houres which really is at high efficiency.
4.0	In the end, it can inspire people's passion about the job they are doing.
8.0	If i do same tasks everyday i must feel tedious to do it dor i can not discover any interesting things from it.
8.0	On the contrary, if i have a lot of different things to do, i must feel energetic because i contact different things and learn differet skilles like i said, maybe i can get to know more interesting people.
8.0	Under that circumstance, i definitely will feel satisfied with my workd and be proud of myself for i can achieve a lot and feel happinese form it.
8.0	I will love my job and do my work harder and put more passion into it.
8.0	And in my opnion, this is suppose to be the healthy way of how we work.
2.0	In conclusion, doing various tasks is better for us.
3.0	Nowdays, there is a phenomenon that some parents give economical reward to their kids when their kids get a high mark.
3.0	People have diffrent opinions over the idea.
3.0	I think this idea has its advantages and disadvantages, but the advantages overweigh the disadvantsges.
4.0	As for disadvantages, this may give their children extra pressure of study.
9.0	To compete with the other ones is already a burden on their shoulder, and now here is another one, to earn extra money.
9.0	Children may get more stressed with their study, and may do harm to their mental health.
4.0	As for advantages, this way give the children another motivation to learn things well, so they will put much more efforts into doing this.
8.0	On this condition, their starting point is not to learn more knowledge, but they can accomplish the basic purpose of education, which is gaining knowledge.
8.0	What's more.
8.0	Now is an intellectual generation, knowledege is money, ability is a measurement of the future.
8.0	The idea sounds material, which is also the truth in today's world.
8.0	Hence, I believe it shape their idea about money realisticly and let them see the adult's world a little bit more.
4.0	So on the whole, I think the advantages much overweigh the disadvantages, which means it is a good idea on a certain level.
8.0	Then here comes to the problem of how to apply the idea better.
8.0	I think the parents should set specific rules to their kids and limit the money they should receive.
8.0	Each time shouldn't be too much and the amount should be under strict order.
8.0	I believe in this way, the kids will be more displined and to alleviate the disadvantages of the problem--kid's over stress.
2.0	To sum up, in my view, as long as under control, to offer some material benefits to acknowlege children's work is accesible, which is an positive idea.
3.0	With the development of society, life pace has become so fast that people have less and less time to company their family members.
3.0	In order to spend the precious time meaningfully with children, parents have to decide what kind of activities is the best for them to enjoy with their children.
11.0	From my perspective, spending time to do things that are related to schoolwork is a better way for parents to conduct.
4.0	First of all, every child may confront with all kinds of problems in their study.
8.0	However, most of the kids lack experiences and methods to deal with them, making it vital for parents to help and instruct them to solve the problems.
8.0	For instance, when I was in elementary school, my math was so poor that I regarded it a torture to finish my daily math homework and assignments.
8.0	Although my mother was usually busy at work, she still decided to spend two hours every day with me to review my math textbook and finish excercises assigned by my math teacher.
8.0	My math grade gradually became better under her careful instruction, at the same time I felt really comforted due to her gentle and patient attitude.
4.0	Furthermore, it is neccesary for parents to care about their children's study in case that kids may get lazy and escape from studying.
8.0	For example, my cousin was addicted to playing computer games when he was a middle school student.
8.0	His parents were indifferent about his grades and allowed him to spend all of his time on computer games, sometimes even played together with him.
8.0	Therefore, my cousin wasn't admitted by any high school and had to start work early.
8.0	Without any practical knowledge learned from school, he couldn't get a payful job, which made his life really harsh.
4.0	Last but not least, doing things about schoolwork with children also benefits the parents, since they can learn some knowledge through this process.
8.0	As the science and technologies develop quickly recently, only with endless study of latest knowledge can people win the fierce competition in work.
8.0	For example, ten years ago, people didn't believe that young children could felt empathy about others, and they only reacted to things that happened directly to them.
8.0	However, we know that young kids have complex emotions and can feel empathey about others.
8.0	If parents who work as kindergarten teachers can do some psychology schoolwork with their children together, they will have the chance to know about this correction and adjust themselves in their work, which may improve their work efficiency.
2.0	In a word, spending time doing things related to schoolwork is beneficial to both children and parents.
11.0	The significance of education should be under no circumstances neglected.
12.0	Therefore, a great many of parents would like to engage in children's education.
11.0	Some contend that children shoudn't be allowed to make mistakes in order to avoid severe conditions.
12.0	Nevertheless, I believe that children shuld be permitted to make mistakes and learn from them, for it can prevent them from making the same mistakes again.
12.0	Moreover, Children's  personality gets enhanced from their parents' tolerance.
5.0	First of all, once a child make a mistake, the consequent result, no matter serious or not, will warn him not do such thing again.
8.0	Otherwise, the child may do something to prevent it.
8.0	From this mistake, children are enabled to enrich their knowledge.
8.0	What's more?
8.0	Their personal abilities are improves.
8.0	For instance, once my brother mistaken soy for vinegar.
8.0	However, my aunt taught him patiently to distinguish them from the smell.
8.0	From then on, he never made the same mistake again.
8.0	He will first take a smell before bring the bottle of liquid to the dinner table.
5.0	On top of that, parents' behaviours are likely to exert some impact on children's development.
9.0	Their tolerance will make a decent model for the children.
9.0	To illustrate, their tolerance to children's mistakes will teach their children to be tolerant to orthers
2.0	According to the above two reasons.
7.0	I firmly believe that it is perferable for parents to all
11.0	Although some people think one cannot learn to be a leader, I think people can learn how to be a leader by severl ways.
12.0	Leadership always presents in three ways: aestheticlly,creativity, and persistently.
12.0	Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple Inc, is the most successful I admire.
12.0	He is not born to be a leader, but as we all know , he did a exllent job in leading Apple Inc become one of the most valuable company in the world.
5.0	We all more or less use some Apple product, like iMac, iPhone,iPad etc.
8.0	All these amazing product are not designed by themselves but by peoples' creativity.
8.0	In 1997, there was a financial crisis, at that time, jobs released iMac with a crust with a unique color with transparency materials and iMac help Apple live through this crisis.
8.0	Steves' knowledge about aesthetic help the company out of trouble and we can learn from this story that aesthetic really helps in design.
8.0	But, can  aesthetic be learned ?
8.0	of course.
8.0	This the first reason why I think one can learn to be a leader
5.0	Secondly, the creativity is also a important part for leadership.
8.0	As we mentioned above, all the Apple product is a creativity.
8.0	Why people like Apple product?
8.0	because it is something we new, we never saw before, and it all credits to creativity.
8.0	Who to learn to creative, there are lot of ways.
8.0	when you at work, try to do things from more perspective, this also kind of creativity.
1.0	Last, persistently.
1.0	A leader can not leading without persistently.
8.0	When Apple face the worst financial crisis, did he gave up?
8.0	No, he did not.
8.0	He persist and then the new product comes out and save the day.
8.0	How do we learn persist?
8.0	try to do everything perfectly like punching your time card, tell yourself you'll not miss punch in even once for a month, if you accomplish it, that means you learn part of persistent.
3.0	With a raised awareness of the monumental effect of celebrities, almost everyone including every age of people is affected by the influence of celebrities.
3.0	Many reports show that many young people even old people are motivated or depressed by the opinion of celebrities.
3.0	However, as far as I am concerned, the importance of celebrities on younger people cannot be overemphasized.
11.0	In other words, it is more essential to younger people with the opinions of their celebrities.
5.0	Firstly, the young is mentally and physically unmature.
8.0	They tend to be affected by their idols such as famous entertainers and athletes.
8.0	Whenever a celebrity who they like have a new twitter, they cannot wait to see it.
8.0	One of my best friend Joe may serve as a good example.
8.0	He loves watching NBA, and he is fond of Lebron James, one of the greatest basketball players now.
8.0	Once James expresses his opinions in twitter or elsewhere, he attempts to read them and most of the time he agrees with them.
8.0	In other words, he is deeply affected by James.
8.0	But luckily, James always show a positive attitude so my friend is quite motivated by him.
8.0	It turns out to be a good impact on him.
8.0	But, as for older people, who are out-of-date and stubborn, are difficult to change their attitudes only by seeing the opinions of celebrities.
8.0	In most cases, they don't care about the politics but only little daily things.
5.0	Moreover, younger people have easier access to the celebrities.
8.0	They can know celebrities' activity only by clicking the button of smartphones or computer mouse.
8.0	Naturally, the opinions of celebrities can exert great influence on the young.
8.0	In the mean time, older people usually use the traditional way to obtain the information.
8.0	As a result, their pace to follow the speed is usually far behind.
8.0	What's more, they are unlikely to have a celebrity who they like in their heart owing to the different value standard.
2.0	All in all, it is opinions of celebrities that make a difference.
3.0	It's normal in China that parents give their children money or other thing that the children like when they get a high grade.
12.0	But I don't think it's a good way to help the children,in stead,I think it is a really bad idea!
5.0	First ,it will let the children think they study hard just for the money,not for theirselves.
8.0	It is really bad because if one day you don't give them money or other brides,the children will have no power to study anymore and they will even feel angre with you and then hate the study.
8.0	The parents can't take care of the children forever,and the situation I said before must happened one day.
8.0	Many children I know is just like this.
8.0	This really bad for children!
5.0	Second, the money may make the children bad.
8.0	First of all,if a child really wants to get the money,but he/she doesn't study well then he/she may cheating others in the exam in order to get the money.
8.0	that's really bad！
8.0	If a child did it once and he/she usually will do it twice, three times.......
8.0	And when the most important exam coming,and he/she doesn't get a good score,that is really bad for the child's life!
8.0	One of my sister,just did this,and her parents got very sad,but they can't  do anythhing!
8.0	Just fell pity--why did I do this！
1.0	All in all,it is a really bad idea to give the childrenmoney or other kinds thing for each high grade,It is really bad for them!
1.0	Let them know study is all for thenselves!
3.0	Nowadays, education is an important plan for this society, parents more care about their children points.
12.0	They usually give some stakes for their children when they have a good grades.
12.0	However, some parents give their chilfren money, they think it can encourage their remain their marks.
11.0	As for me, I agree that parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.
11.0	I have some reasons to explain.
5.0	First of all, students acquire money when they have a good grades can gave their energy study hard.
8.0	When studnts study in class, they know that a good grade canacquire a fantastic persent, they have a good mood  to study knowledge, it also increase their efficient.
8.0	For instance, my friend David used to like play basketball, so he is bad for english.
8.0	However, in a english exam, he make a good point in english math problem.
8.0	It helps he improve some money from his parents.
8.0	Then he know studys advantage and study hard, at next semester, he was to be a good student in our class.
5.0	In addition, students acquire money when they have a good grades can teach their manage their wealth.
8.0	financial is an important plan in modern life, parents can teach their children how to use it, it has plenty of influence for students life.
8.0	My classmate Tom is a good example, he is a good student in childhood and high mark in class.
8.0	His parents usually give some money for him and record his cost, so Tom made a good habit is save money to do someting.
8.0	And now, he also have perfect ability to control his money, his grades is better than in the past.
7.0	Admittedly, students acquire money when they have a good grades also have some disadvantages, for example
11.0	Some people are think that doing ohysical exercise is a good way to relax in their life.
12.0	However I have a different idea.
12.0	when it comes to the statement that watching  a movie or reading a book enable to relax people,I strong agree.
5.0	Firstly,reading a book to realx is extremely convient and easy.
8.0	If you want to go to fitness club to exercise,you have to take a lot of time.
8.0	And also you might have to pay the money for your exercise class.
8.0	However,when you want to have a relax,you enable to read a book on your home even your office room.
8.0	There is no doubt that reading a book is more convient than doing physical exercise.
5.0	Secondly，reading a book is really make you feel relief.
8.0	Not like doing some exercise such as jogging and mascle strench,reading a book won't take so much time and energy.
8.0	You can make a cup of coffce and eat some baked cakes.
8.0	It is your time without anyone's disturb.
8.0	Quiet wonderful and comfortable.
8.0	But,doing physical exercise needs you to focus on the game,you boby will be nervous .
8.0	It is exciting ranther than realxing.
0.0	In summary,randing a book is perior to doing physical exercise when you want to ralax.
0.0	Not only because reading a booking is more convient ,but also let us extremely relax.
0.0	Some people maybe have the different idea that doing physical exercise is more fun.
0.0	Hpwever ,it is not a better chioce for the man who wants to relax himself.
3.0	I always hear some camplain in my neighborhood parents that their children behave badly in school, such as sleep during the class, could not finish homework on time, or fail in every exam .
3.0	So these parents have no alternative but to reward their kids when they get high score in school, because they want to motivate these kids to study hard.
11.0	However, in my perspective, I have the profound conviction that I certainly agree with the behavior because the approach can stimulate they study at school.
4.0	First of all, getting a reward is a meaningful way to get recognition for children's accomplishments.
8.0	Having received an acknowledgement of their achievements, children would be futher motivated to study hard.
8.0	For instance, I can clearly remember that when I was at primary school, my parents were busy will their works, and their time and energy were occupied with their all tasks, so they could not have time to accompany.
8.0	However, compared with these children that parents always stay with them, I achieve my goal and gain very high score at exam.
8.0	People might be surprised with this, I can gain ideal grades because my parents will reward me, and I will feel sense of achievement, so I will study hard and gain better score.
4.0	On top of that, offering their school-age money is a favorable avenue to build up children's value to money, so they not only can have the ability to manage their money, but also enable them to make full preparation for the future.
8.0	To illustrate, many individuals could not comsume rational on the account of their fasle money value.
8.0	Therefore, cultivate some little kids to manage money is extremely important and necessary.
8.0	In addition, school-age children can be rewarded when they behave well at school is a prerequisite for them to secceed in the future, because they will learn how hard to earn money and have a rational vivwpoint to money.
4.0	Adimmitedly, it is true that reward a child for good exam results is wrong, because a reward my become the child's only goal.
9.0	However, if a people can have definite and specific target, they will become diligent to achieve or reach the destination.
9.0	Therefore, this process can give them a numerous experience and psychological wealth.
2.0	To put all in to a nutshell, I strongly believe that parents are suppoed to pffer their children money for each high grade because they can gain much
3.0	Nowadays, with different working fileds developing, the topic about people's works is highly debated.
3.0	Taking the individual's satisfaction into consideration, many people assert that they will feel more satisfied when  they have various aspects of tasks to do during the workday due to interests and challenging.
3.0	However, a lot of individual contend that they prefer to woking with a similar tasks to do all day long.
11.0	From my perspective, I strongly believe the fromer's statement, and my reasons are as follows.
5.0	First of all, it is a favorable opportunity for workers to have many diverse types of tasks to do because they will be occupied with different working fileds and figure out their real interests.
8.0	To illustrate, take my brother Mike for example, who works in a hospital.
8.0	Last weekend, he told me that he had to finish many work such as call the patients' relatives, look after the patients and have some operations from these sick people, ect.
8.0	Busy as my brother was, he felt really satisfied due to he figure out which work is the suitable for him to do.
8.0	I can clearly remember that his favorite work is having conservations with the patients' relatives because he will fell happy to hear that the patients' good news.
8.0	So working with different tasks can help people to know which aspect is the most suitable for them, which is beneficial to their careers' prespect.
5.0	On top of that, if the person has many different types of tasks to do during the workday, they will enjoy the working and devotes to his carrer.
8.0	However, in view of do similar tasks all day long, he must will feel bored and exhausted, so he will give up to finish these tedious assignment eventually.
8.0	For instance, my mother worked at a restaurant several years ago, and she did the dished everyday.
8.0	How boring and bland the work was!
8.0	Finally, my mother made a decesion to change anthor interesting job.
1.0	To sum up, it is true that people will focus on and pay more attention on doing simialr tasks all day long, which will help them improve the effective.
1.0	Nevertheless, people can not repeat only a task all the day.
7.0	So I extremely contend that they will feel satistied
11.0	Although nobody like making mistakes, we all konw that no one is perfect and will make mistakes, especially for children.
12.0	It always seems difficult for parents to sit back and allow their child to make a mistake.
12.0	However, at some point, being a good parent  means to let go.
12.0	Therefore, I suggest that for parents it's better to allow their children to make mistakes and let them to learn from their own mistakes.
4.0	First of all, mistakes allow us to realize our drawbacks and disadvantages, thus we can improve ourselves.
8.0	Although some mistakes may dispoint you, it avoids you to do them same again.
8.0	"When I was a kid I always forgot to bring my homework to school, and I will call my mom to bring me my homework but one day my mom said ""I am sorry you forgot your homework, but that is your responsibility."""
8.0	I fail to get my homework that time, but since then, I have never forgot it again.
4.0	What's more, when parents told their children what they shouldn't do may have a negative impact on these children.
8.0	Because everyone has it's own value system, and they are immature when they are young.
8.0	Usually some children are not willing to listen to their parents' suggestions and tend to do something oppsite way.
8.0	At this point, the parents may be disappointed.
8.0	Therefore, when parents allows their children to try, it may be good for their health.
4.0	It's true that some mistakes should be prevented such as being addicated to drugs, or steal some things because it may lead a crime road for children and may affect their future life.
10.0	However, for most conditions it's better for parents to let children go.
2.0	All in all, parents should allow their children to make mistakes from which they can learn significant lessons.
11.0	There are too many things to consider when choosing one of the various ways of education.
11.0	Different people have different opinions aboout how to teach their children to be knowlegeable.
12.0	As far as I am concerned, it is not appropriate for parents to provide their children with money for each high grade they get in school.
5.0	Firstly, this way may make children under too much pressure, which may make children make so many mistakes.
8.0	As we all know, children want to get money given by their parents to by what they desire for.
8.0	And when they know they can by this way  gain what they want, they will spare no effort to get good grades.
8.0	However, it will also make children so strained that they will make many mistakes when taking exams.
8.0	For example, my brother performed well in his high school and he did well in all the subjects, which indicates that he would be amitted into the best university in our own country.
8.0	Then his parents guaranteed that if he got good grades in the entrance exam, they will buy what he desired for.
8.0	Unfortunately, he was strained and did not reach his total potential in the entrance exam.
8.0	Finally, he did not perform well in the exam.
8.0	In conclusion, this way can't be used to teach school-age children because it will make them feel so stressed.
5.0	Secondly, this way may distort children's attitude of value and world.
8.0	As the saying goes, book is the ladder for human.
8.0	That we study hard is to make contribution for the society and make effort for our own country rather than earning much money.
8.0	Studying can make us skillful or knowlegeable instead of making us greedy.
8.0	For example, there are many malicious hackers  in our society, a famous hacker named Wang Dachui who is expert in the aspect of computer science.
8.0	He uses his knowledge to attack the company whose scale is smaller, and he compels the boss of company to give him money.
8.0	Occassionaliy, when he was a child, he was taught by his parents in this way.
8.0	Consequently, he is arrested by the police.
8.0	This story tells us that this way can not be used to teach children.
1.0	Juding from all the evidence offered, we may safely arrive at the conclusion that offering school-age children money for each high grade they get in school may make them strained and deform their attitudes.
1.0	Therefore, this way which may hurt the children is not correct.
12.0	Nowadays, as the society develops quikly, there is a hot debate that whether teachers should get at least salary as much as doctors, business leaders or lawyers get.
11.0	I disagree with this idea for these reasons.
5.0	Firstly, teachers have the qulities that also needed in other works, such as a sense of responsibility, love and highly needed skills and knowledge.
8.0	This is because the teachers teaches children who are the future of a country.
8.0	In this case, not only do the kids need the knowledge, but also they need to be treated carefully without hurt.
8.0	Doctors must be responsible for their patients and the knowledge to save people who are in danger.
8.0	Lawyers need to be a sense of justice and knowlege to protect the equal of society.
8.0	A business leader should consider for his or her employeers and a knowledge to solve financial problems.
8.0	On the contrary, if they don't have these qualities the society will is in a mess.
8.0	For example, a recent news that many little kids in kindergarden were hurt by their teachers.
8.0	After that, these kids had nightmares every day.
8.0	In this case, they cannot grow up healthily.
8.0	So I think they share the same qualities.
5.0	Secondly, teachers make a great effort as these positions do, which is work hard whenever their objects need help.
8.0	This is because a student may need help after school.
8.0	In this situation, the teacher has to extra task.
8.0	When a patient is in danger at midnight, even though the doctor is at home, he has to rush to hospital immediately.
8.0	When an inspiration occurs, the lawyer has to continue analyze carefully.
8.0	Whenever a case can be discussed, a business leader has to negotiate immediately.
8.0	In contrast, if they are not devoted to their work, students cannot get progress; patients cannot obtain first aid; peopel cannot be cleared; workers cannot get salary and do on.
8.0	For instance, my cousin is a Chinese teacher in Wuhan NO.1 High School, who work at midnight to check her students homework.
3.0	Are the sports and scial acetivities as imortant as the courses and should treat them equally?
3.0	That is a good question and there are varies answer for that.
11.0	Some people will say yes; Some people will say no.
11.0	But in my opinion, we should treat the sports,social activities  and classes equally.
6.0	First of all,  students should work on both physical and mental aspects.
8.0	All of sports,social activities and classes, libraries are benefical to the students' future.
8.0	For instance, doing sports can help students build their body, and improve their immunity, which will protect them from diseases.
8.0	Social activities help students trains their communication skills.
8.0	In the future live , students will face many situation which is required the speaking skills.
8.0	Campus is indeed place where students can practice their social communication ability.
8.0	Similarily, the classes and libraies are also improtant.
8.0	In the future career, many companies and other organiztion need students have profassional knowledge.
8.0	Students can learn the nessessary skills from the classes and libariaries.
8.0	It also train the learning skills and research skills.
8.0	When students search the information form the libraires and try to understand what professors are teached, they will improve theirself.
8.0	Furthermore, the sprots, social activities and classes, libraries supples each other.
8.0	When you do some sports, your immunity will be improved, which protect you from disease, that means you won't be influented by disease and you can concentrate on your study.
8.0	Practicing the social skills can lead students cooperate with other students smoothly, which is benefitcial for students' group study.
2.0	Secondly, the sports and social activities should get  financial support as much as classes and librarise.
7.0	For exmple, both of sports and classes
3.0	Nowadays,increasing attention has been set in the education of the school-age children in every family.
12.0	To enhance their grades,the society,especially the children's parents will offer children money.
12.0	I quite appreciate this idea.
8.0	It's a efficient pattern that has already been examined in many companies.
8.0	Employees all work hard to perform better so they can get a reward for their work.
8.0	Material incentive also make sense for school-age children.
8.0	A cash reward can stimulate them in study.
8.0	For instant,my first iphone is bought by the money I gained from my parents for the good grades I got in a final exam.
8.0	To get my phone, I spare no effort to review my geography,t he subject I couldn't deal with before.
8.0	While there's not a clear goal to achieve,the money parents offer can really be a vivid thing to catch.
6.0	What's more,why cant't parents offer children money for high grades while school offer students scholarships for excellent performance?
8.0	I hold the view that they are some parts in common.
8.0	The scholarship ,however,it's limited and hard for some students to get.
8.0	Maybe you make extreme progress in your study though you are stil middle in the class,it is possible for you to earn a scholarship just for the tops.
8.0	But parents can always give the children this award as a encouragement when they deserve it.
7.0	It is no more than money but a honor for the children, I always feel proud ofmy phone and treasure it

3.0	Nowadays,some parents give their children prize when they get high mark in school.
12.0	I think this is not really benifit to kids' life.
12.0	Here's my opinion.
6.0	Firstly, children may be more dependent when they grow up.
8.0	Since every time they get money from their parents, they may think their parents are rich enough to pay for their score.
8.0	they will turn to their parents for money when they grow up, which means they will be not independent.
8.0	Take a friend who is already the age to find a job for exemple.
8.0	He has earned award for his getting good grades.
8.0	What is he doing now?
8.0	Only sitting in the sofa, begs money from his parents.
8.0	He can not just works himself to earn income.
8.0	Because in his opinion, even if he  has no job, his parents do have ability keep him living wonderful life.
0.0	This is of course not the only disadvantage.
0.0	Giving kids money for their grades can also make them cocentrate more on fame and money than spirit.
0.0	Children given so much money may fall in love with the feel of being award.
8.0	When they become adults, all they want is to reperform this feel.
8.0	It is not uncommon for us to heard that someone earn quantities of profit due to others pain.
8.0	This is what is going to be.
8.0	For instance, a townmate of my friend, who is selling food.
7.0	He, of course getting pay in his child
11.0	There are many things to consider when thinking about the rules that young people obey.
12.0	Different people will have different ideas on whether it is too strict for young people to follow the rules.
12.0	Some people think some rules is so rigorous that young people can't afford it.
11.0	I disagree with this  statement.
9.0	Strict rules will teach prople many things they have to know in society.
9.0	Such as independence,work efficiency,a regular habit.
6.0	Strict rules will make some young people to become more independently.
8.0	because young people live in a complex society.
8.0	This strict rules can tell them how to live by themselves.
8.0	For example some university students after graduate.
8.0	They have no supplyment from society,and they don't want to use money from their parents.
8.0	so they find for investment,and they need to get in a company or other place to survive.
10.0	Society rules and company rules will compel them to become independence.
0.0	Not only strict rules will give independence for young people,but also provide a regular habit for them.a strict rules will bulid a good habit for people to live more exactly.
0.0	For instance.
0.0	my friend's uncle who has a bad habit before.
7.0	but when he got in a society he
11.0	When we are young, everyone wants to be a big boss to conduct many people.
11.0	A neccessary ability to be an employer is leadership.
11.0	Some insists that leadership comes naturally, only the gifted person can realize the dream of childhood.
11.0	However, others reckon that people can try their best to abtain the ability of leadership.
11.0	I definitely agree with the latter point, I think the leadership should be decided by individual effort.
6.0	First of all, leadership can be determined by personality which could change with the different experience.
8.0	For instance, I was a shy and tremulous girl when I was a middle school student.
8.0	I was afraid of talking to others which means it's impossible for me to lead others.
8.0	But when I entered the high school, I met a teacher who taught me English.
8.0	My English grade was excellent, so my teacher often took after me.
8.0	She knew I was tremulous, so she always encouraged me to talk to her, and I make little progress on talking to others.
8.0	Gradually, my teacher encouraged me to deliver the speech which is influnced me a lot.
8.0	I become a courageous girl and I was fond of gather classmates to join the activities.
8.0	Now, I am a college students and I am charge of a whole department in the students organization.
8.0	Therefore, the leadership is not come naturally, the personality may make a important role at leadership.
1.0	Second, people can obtain the leadership ability by learning related courses.
1.0	For example, my roommate can not speak clearly before finding the jobs.
7.0	But she  All in all, the leadership is not a gi
12.0	I don't think it's a good idea for some parents award their children's grade with money.
12.0	When it comes to prasise from parents, as far as i'm concerned, there are many choices better than money, such as hug, little presents, free times amd so on.
12.0	Following are my reasons: First of all, giving money as high marks will help to grow children's venality, which is harmful to student's growth.
12.0	Children will tend to attach studying to material rather than accomplishment.
12.0	They are tend to Second, it may enhance the comparing phenomenon between teenagers, thus more and more students will focus on external apperance, luxury things, etc.
8.0	Those children whose family are not rich enough to provide rewards will be pity and full of remorse, they will hold a negative attitude towards test.
8.0	Other students who get award will make comparison each other, insteading compete in academic grades.
8.0	Last but not the least, as a school-age children, they don't have ability to manage money, most of them even have little knowledge of how to save money instead of waste it.
8.0	Changes are that they spend large amounts of money on chasing top stars, playing computer games and buying clothes.
8.0	These behavior will betray parent's inallity hope as to motivate them in better performances.
2.0	All in all, I recommend that parents should think twice about the award for teenagers.
10.0	As they have immature thinking towards own possession, attention should be paid on how to cultivate their correct financing concept.
12.0	Well, there are ceaseless discussing of teachers should or not  tell their views in social and political to students in the classroom.
11.0	Some people think it doesn't matter, and others think they shouldn't do this.
11.0	I think the teachers shouldn't to do this, in order to respect students, concentate more focus on class.
5.0	Firstly, teachers' responsiblity includes respecting their students.
8.0	And all students have their independent social or political views, they also have differences between each other.
8.0	So teachers also need to respect them.
8.0	And Students are not also growing up in the same environment, their views can't be absolutely same.
8.0	For example, it has 30 students in a same class.
8.0	Some students born in a politics family, some students born in a normal family, and some of them born in a business family.
8.0	So they have difference social or political views, teachers can't think all of them are true.
8.0	Because teachers has their own opinions.
8.0	But students have their own reasons to think their opinion is true, because the student live in their environment for a long time and it's their own privacy.
5.0	Secondly, the classroom is the place for teaching.
8.0	The teachers' major responsiblity is teaching knowledge in classes.
8.0	So if the teachers tell students about their social or political views, the process of class will be disturbed.
8.0	And the efficient of studying will be declined.
8.0	If the teachers not showing the views, they will more concenrate on teaching.
8.0	And students can learn more knowledge in class, their studying efficiency will be improved.
8.0	For instance, it has 45 minutes in a period of class.
8.0	Teachers have to teach students knowledge.
8.0	If the teacher talk about views for 15 minutes, student just has 30 minutes  to learn knowledge.
8.0	So the speed of learing are more slow than the teachers are not show the view in classroom.
8.0	And after several days, their time in learning are more less than others, so their grade will be declined, even a lot.
2.0	So the students have their own views in political or social, teacher can't disturb it in order to respect students.
7.0	And the classroom is not the appropriate place to talk about this because is the place for s
3.0	Nowadays, in the fast- paced society,  a siginificent number of people do their utmost to achieve their goals in order to gain acceptance from others.
3.0	Some people thinks it is unneccesary to act like that.
11.0	However, in my opinion, If people surrounding me is working towards his target carefully, I am more willing to help the struggling strangers.
12.0	I think most people hold the same view with me.
5.0	Admitteddly, no matter how hardworking a person  is, he just  be regarded as strangers.
8.0	We do not have the obligation to help him to  accomplish his target.
8.0	Lots of people may agree with this statement.
8.0	Actually , both we are normal person , even though sometimes we have the ability to help strangers, we are afraid of making mistakes which will lead to do harm to the struggling strangers.
8.0	What's more, strangers usually would like to realize their dreams by themselves.
8.0	However,  the world is complicated, which do not allow us to consider whether to help a person with spirit of   trying their best and  taking risks or not.
8.0	Therefore, I think prople are more willing to help the struggling strangers as soon as possilble though we only can help a lot.
5.0	Moreover, the reason  people today are more willing to help struggling strangers is due to their instinct .
8.0	Consciences or ethical decisions make a great influence on people's mind.
8.0	That's because normal people cannot refuse the people who really need sopprots.
8.0	For example, when I was a child, I was always willing to help elder people to go through the crossroad .
8.0	Even though sometimes  I think it is time-consuming for me to help them.
8.0	Nevertheless, the moment I look at them, I have a sense of feeling that I want to tide them over.
8.0	The reward is their smiling.
8.0	After so many years, I
10.0	Finally,
10.0	In conclusion,
11.0	Since the world itself has become more and more complex, the society and technology are developing at a high speed, the modern young generations regarded themselves as more independent and freeer individuals, and they are cble to make decisions about their lives, especially when they are compared to the young generations in the past.
12.0	So here raises a very interesting question: Are we better able to make decisions about our own lives than the.
12.0	young generations in the past?
12.0	Did the rely on thier parents too much?
11.0	However,  I do not think so.
4.0	Young people today have not gone through the hard life so they are not mature enough to make decisions about their lives.
8.0	The young in the past, let me raise the Chinese young generation who lived in the past for example, since they have gone through the WW2, they are much more mature than the young today.
8.0	They had to take care of a series of chores, some of them even had to look after their youger siblings.
8.0	Since they had dealt with alll this at a very young age, they know how to make decisions without their parents.
8.0	However, most of the young genrations have not gone through the hard period of time, they may not deal with their own things well.
4.0	Modern young generations are still dependent, they think themselves independent for they know well about how to use advanced techniques.
10.0	The yough today live in a world full of high technology, since they have come to the world, they grew up with high techniques and those techniques help to solve the problems in life.
4.0	Because most young people have a better understanding in the use of techniques, they think it as a symbol of grown up, which may make them think that they are already independent enough to make decisions whthout parents.
8.0	There were not so many high techniques decades ago!
8.0	So they think they are more independent than the young in the past.
8.0	My opinion is that, they are just good at using techniques, they have seen more high techniques than people in the past, but it doe not mean that they are  mature enough to make their own desicions.
0.0	The young today are confused by the surroungding world.
0.0	The world today are still complex, however, it looks beautiful and peaceful.
0.0	This gives the young a kind of misunderstand, they think they know the world well,but they have not seen the evil of the world yet.
0.0	They still need to be protected.
0.0	In fact, young people from all different periods of time need protection if they have not actually gone into the society.
0.0	For historical reasons,I think young people in the past have seen more evils in the world, so they are more independent in some ways.
3.0	It, obviously, that nowadays people face with more challenges than before.
3.0	For students,  they have to choose only one subject to study or studying multiple-knowledge.
12.0	For employees, as same as students, they can either do similar tasks every day or being a funcational people to do many different kinds of works.
12.0	Different stroves for different folks, If I were a worker, I would do diverse tasks during the workday.
5.0	First and foremost, workers gain a sense of achivement if they have various works to do.
8.0	The meaning od life is not about enjoyment and merriment.
8.0	It is about success and fulfillment.
8.0	Especially, with the development of society, wokers cannot do exactly as same as the generation that their parents experienced.
8.0	which requires people to discover more inspiration and motivation.
8.0	Doing many different tasks is the apparent way to reach this goal.
8.0	Take my brother for example, he is a reporter with dozens of same reading works to do every day.
8.0	With time goes by, he became less passion and full depression.
8.0	My sister saw the change and very annoying.
8.0	So, she told my brother that he either being a loser or changing his work as an editor.
8.0	After my brother varying his job as an enditor, a more active and with a plenty works to do everyday.
8.0	The fashion and funny brother came back.
5.0	Moreover, it is a best chance to learn more knowledge from doing unsimilar tasks.
8.0	Those successful people in this world have a common quality, which is have a amount of whether acadamic knowledge or social princples.
8.0	The more we learn, the more opportunities we can obtain.
8.0	This is the permenat law of success.
8.0	My favorite actor--Eddie Redmanye who won the Acadamy Reward by acting the film <The theory of everything>.
8.0	In order to performing this role more active and realistic, Eddie, a people who majored in culture, started studying math.
8.0	He went to the university to find the feel of being a math student.
8.0	Thanks to his hard work, the excellent performing brought him a very big prize.
0.0	Admittedly, it is true that doing similar tasks all day along is more sable and has less pressure.
0.0	However, as a modern people with diverse modifications, wokers are no longer only chase safety and stability.
0.0	The more different  tasks they do, the better chance they can success.
0.0	To sum up, a sense of satisification comes from doing various works other than doing slightly different tasks during the workday.
3.0	Firstly, I offer a point of view that this is a good idea for parents get their children money for their high grade.
3.0	There are two advantages.
3.0	As we all know, studying is a critical hard work for our students.
3.0	They have to get up earlier than ouhers, from morning to evening.
3.0	There are too many subjects for students to finish, never mind the comptition with their classmates and the stress coming from their parents and teachers.
3.0	Generly speaking, students are under the press, so I agree to give some money for their small achivement with hard working.
11.0	Taking myself for an example.
10.0	I used to get some money after my final exam, not too much, I could use this money to buy some favourite books.
5.0	On the anther hand, I look on this kind of prize as view as form between parents and children.
8.0	The fact is that students spent most of their time in school with test books, but not their family.
8.0	Children need affection in their growth, which is the direct communication with thier parents, but heavy study works took most time.
8.0	I think giving some prize according to their grades is an effective way to maintain the relationship with parents and students, so that students will not be separated from families completely because of study.
5.0	Although it is a good way for the relationship in family in my oppion.
9.0	I still suggest parents do not to focus all of their love and care in this way, the money.
9.0	Children need the affection from parents, prize is just a tool.
3.0	In such an accelerate modern society, there is an increasing gang of people paying more attention to the working, everyone is busy in working.
11.0	And nowadays, there is an issue that people will do few things well if they are busy doing many differents tasks has provoked a highly debate.
12.0	Some hold that it would not matter anything if we do many different kinds of things.
11.0	But however, as for me, it has many obvious defects if we do a lot of diverse things.
5.0	First and foremost, we will be distributed if we do various things in a time.
8.0	For instance, you should know that, if you have two days to finish some tasks, and you want to finish them as fast as you can, so you will definitely devote all of your emotion and become busy doing all of them.
8.0	Then later, you find you just finish all of them in one day!
8.0	But finally, you still be criticized by your boss whereas you just made a lot of mistakes in those assignments.
8.0	That is because you are just in a busy time of doing many many things, so you will definitely have a consequence of defeat.
5.0	Secondly, being busy doing a lot of things also have some effects in our working efficiency.
8.0	For example, I have a friend, John, who is a good grade student in my class when I was in senior high school.
8.0	There was a weekend, he had numerous of assignments to do and in that weekend he was also required to hand in his extra English classes.
8.0	So there was not much time for him to finish those tasks.
8.0	In that circumstance, he was fairly anxious and he had to do his them in his additional English classes.
8.0	Finally he did nothing, because he just cannot concentrate himself on these homework, so it was an really an low efficiency way to do many tasks busily.
0.0	Finally, doing many thins busily also could cause us some health problems.
0.0	We can easily consider that what will happen to our bodies when we are in a high pressure and busy atmosphere for a long time.
0.0	Without thinking that we could gain some serious deseases if we always in busy time, and this will absolutely cause us do fairly few things well.
3.0	The issue of whether individuals have inborned ablity is highly debatable.
3.0	Is leadership comes naturally?
12.0	Some individuals hold the view that leadership is instinctive ability for some outsatnding perosons while others hold the opposte veiw.
11.0	As far as my concerned, each one  cannot successful get such inborn skills.
5.0	To begin with, leadership cloesly related to people lifes' accmulated expereice.
8.0	This is primarily because the fact supreme persons tend to learn form their life expreince whatever result succesful or not.
8.0	For this reason, the next time when  faced with the same difficult situations, they can  easily resolved with the guidence of  previous experence.
8.0	For example, Jobs is famous in his leadership and his great ablity for the develpment in the phone.
8.0	His imagination about techlonogy had fully excert on his compamy products such as iphone.
8.0	His experrence s
5.0	Moreover, the
0.0	It seems that leader's leadership comes naturally for they have corract judgement and prosseeing decison which optimize economic benefits.
0.0	However in another way we can see that they were not as a leader at first.
0.0	It means that their good qualities such as persistence and learning from otheres and grasp the opportunity that also used in the leadership.
12.0	I think think is a good idea.
12.0	because in my childhood,my parents also will give me money for high grade i get in the school.
12.0	i think it's a good way to encourage your childen to study harder.
8.0	only if they get something good from you, they will be interested in studying.
8.0	childen will thought money as a encouragement to their hard work,so next time they will even tey their best to gain more prizes.
8.0	on the other hand,offering money also teachs chiildren that within your hard work and exercise,you will get whatever you desire.
8.0	this percetion will be playing an active role among kids life and being beneficial for them whenever and wherever they will be.
8.0	for example,in my childhood,my parents will offer me money for the high grade i get in school.
8.0	and i will save the money.
8.0	everytime i saw the money, i will feel happy, so i will study more hard.
6.0	however,money will have no real effects on children or even bedtrimental to them.
10.0	as we know, children can't always keep their mind clear enough to judge one thing is good or not,so sometimes they will make wrong decision, And children might become wasting money, take my classmates Kaim as an example,for sake of gaining more money,he try to cheat his parents even if he get a low  grade
11.0	I think it is a good idea to do this.
11.0	Sometimes parents give children some rewards, it is really a good way idea to make the relationship between parents and children better than before.
11.0	There are some reasons.
4.0	Firstly, children should be given some reward when they do something great.
9.0	For instance, I used to practice karate when I was still a child, but I do not like that, Iike to play the piano, After I practiced for about 5 years, my father asked me to join a national competition, I got champion that time, but I still did not want continue to practice, after I go back home my father gave me reward, it makes very happy, so I continued to practice.
9.0	Reward can make children happy.
4.0	Secondly, rewards can make people confident.
10.0	For exampe, I have a best friend named Jiachi, he started to swim since he was still 2 years old, when he was 9 years old, he jioned match, and got a not bad but also not good grades, his parents did not shout at him, instead to give hime some rewards, so he have confidence to keep swimming until now, even if he gets into the high school and has much pressure than before, he will still go to swim twice a week.
4.0	Thirdly, reward is very normal in universities, and it has a proper noun named scholarship.
9.0	See that, all of good universities will give rewards to good students, to make them stay in their schools, to give them confidence for keeping studying hard, to make them happy and have less pressure.
9.0	Moreover the parents.
0.0	All in all, parents should give children some money as reward properly.
0.0	it will give many results that you can not imagine.
0.0	So I think it is a good idea that some parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.
3.0	I  dont   think  it  is   better  for young  people   to  relax  by    watching  a  movie  or  reading  a book  than   take  some  physical  exercise  .
6.0	It  goes  without  saying  that  taking exercise  can  build  up  our   physical strenth.
8.0	As  we  know  ,sports plays  an  important  role  in our  daily   lives,whenever  ,  wherever  you do  some  exercise you  can  get  a  whole new  refresh  feeling  through   your  body .
8.0	For  examples  ,going out  to  play  ball games ,which  is  more  and  more popular  these  years,can  get  rid  of bad  moods,and  help   you  be  energetic  again  .
8.0	In another  hand, physical  exercise  is  also   the  best  way   to  keep  fit,keep  healthy.
10.0	As  we  know   ,  reading  a book,watching a  movie,all suh  art  pursuit  is  also   a  important   part  of our lives  ,we  cant just   live   without  soul   pursuit .
11.0	Well,in my opinion,I think it has two sides.
11.0	It could be good and could be bad.
8.0	Sometimes when a child wants something very desperately, you can use this way to make him / her to study harder.
8.0	And good grades are a good thing.
8.0	Without good grades,how can he/she get into a good university?
8.0	There was a time when I want a toy terribly, and my mom used that way and my grades got higher and higher than ever.
8.0	So I think it is a pretty good way to get higher grades.
6.0	But there is a disadvantage too.
8.0	If you use that way, maybe children will think that he / she is learning for money.
8.0	That could be a really bad thing because if your children think that way,they are not learning for themselfs,they are learning for money.
8.0	If you someday say that they can't get money if they get good grades,some would lose the interest for learning, maybe exept his / her favorite class.
8.0	But thinking that you are learning for money could maybe be a good thing (here we go again).
8.0	If you think about it in some way, maybe you are learning for money to live a better life in the future.
8.0	If he / she mentaly thinks like that, it will not matter whether you give money to him / her for getting good grades.
8.0	He / she will learn hard for it even if you do not give him money for good grades.
0.0	So it is up to you to decide whether to give your child money for good grades or not.
0.0	there will be advantages and disadvantages for everything.
0.0	It's up to you du decide whether the gain is worth the pain or the gain does not worth the pain.
3.0	With the development of society, people need to get a good diploma to have a good job.
11.0	If you want to get a good diploma you need to study harder.
11.0	But in these days, some of people want to use some easier ways for success in a future job, like  having a good relationship with other people rather than studying harder in school to accumulate more knowledge.
12.0	As long as I concern, I prefer studying harder in school for success in a future job.
6.0	First of all, studying harder is more reliable than having a good relationship with other people.
8.0	Because knowledge belong to yourself, anyone can not steal it.
8.0	Any knowledge you learn have posibility to use in the future.
8.0	For example, I have two good friends who are Lucy and Coco in the university.
8.0	They all wanted to success in the future.
8.0	So Lucy chosed to cultivate a good relationship to people who can help her to get a good job or teach her some experience.
8.0	But she did not care about the study in the university.
8.0	In turn, Coco chosed to study hard in the university.
8.0	You can not see her outside in the weekend, she always stayed in the library to study and accumulated the knowledge every day.
8.0	To the end, Coco got a perfect job in  the USA, but Lucy just need to study more and she can not pass the meeting.
8.0	Secondly, studying can help you attain better relationship in the future.
8.0	Because in these days society are more fair than  in old times.
8.0	People need have ability to do any thing which can be qualified any job.
8.0	And in that time, you will have more and more friends because you have charms to attract other people.
1.0	Undoubtedly, if you have ability to relate well to people, maybe you will have good job.
1.0	But this ability can not hold all the time.
7.0	beacuse knowledge is the most reliable thing to help you, and it is the only thing
12.0	In my opinon, I think it isbetter to relax by watching a movie or reading a book, here are some of my reson.
8.0	Firstly,I think if a people are very tired means he didn't want to do anything.
8.0	Most of people want to choose stay at a place with rlaxing environment,  If you just work and work, it's can let you more tired.
8.0	So this is why I think do some physical exercise is not a rlaxing work..
10.0	Secondly, I think if wecan do something let you feel exciting or funny, watching a movie or reading a book is you best choose,once, my mother doing many houseworks, and she just drinking a cuo of tea and watching a movie , then she said is so great, and she seem like energic and she dong her work again,  in the end, I think many people, sometimes they think they need they should do some physical exercise,  is depend on they have energy and they feel happiness, then they will consider to do something ,but when a  people said he is tied, its means hejust want to quiet or need some exciting things to encourage him, and stimulate his desires to work.
3.0	Recently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people: which is more improtant, success or remaining haap and optimistic when you fail?
3.0	Opinion vary from person to person.
3.0	Some people claim that success is very important.
3.0	However, I would stand on their opposite side and I believe that remaining optimistic and happy when you fail is more important.
12.0	My viewpoints can be elaborated as follows.
5.0	First of all, remaining a optimistic and happy when you fail can guide success eventually.
8.0	As we know, the mood and attitude towards anything is very vital because it can result a different outcome.
8.0	If you do anything with a negative attitude, you would fail at most of time.
8.0	However, if you are not afraid of failure or even you fail and you have a positive attitude, you would be easier to success or access to the success closely.
8.0	You would have a courage to overcome the failure and be easy to absorb the experience from it.
8.0	Success can be achieved sometimes, but a positive mind can bring success to you eventually.
8.0	For example, last year I took part in a piano contest and I made mistakes when I was performing.
8.0	I ignored the laugh from other people and didn't be  thought over the reason that I would make mistakes.
8.0	Then, I realized that the problem was that I was lack of the experience of performing.
8.0	I tried to perform at many concert and eventually I won the first prize on the national contest of piano.
5.0	Second, remaing happy and optimistic when you fail can shape your personality.
8.0	It is difficult for people to controll their mood when they are suffering from troubles, that's why there are so many phychologists today.
8.0	Success always bring a big fluctuation to people and people could not success every time.
8.0	If we can stay a optimistic attitude when we fail, we would foster an positive attitude to life.
8.0	For example, my consin failed in the final exam and he was very sad and upset.
8.0	He thought that he could not success even if he try his best.
8.0	My uncle was very worried about his mental health.
1.0	To put it in a nutshell, I firmly think it is more essential to keep happy and optimistic when you fail.
1.0	It not only can guide success eventually, but also can shape your personality.
3.0	Kids needs encouragement   Using money to encourage kids to get good grades is a common way ,which parents like to try.
11.0	I do not think it is harmful, because all hard-working needs to be paid.
5.0	All parents(in china) hope their children can be a good student in their class, meanwhile the grades of test reflect whether their kids are good at study.
8.0	it is the most efficient and useful way for parents to encourage their children by money, Which represents parents' love.
8.0	In the one hand children get more power in the encomy, in the other hand they get better grades.
8.0	There is no harm if we teach them how to spend money rigthly, what is more it will grow children an good opinion on money.
5.0	When I was in middle school, I grew a hobby about basketball.
8.0	But my parents would not help me to afford a basketball shoes.
8.0	So I had to save money for a new shoes.
8.0	At that time, my parents was worried about my study.
8.0	So they admitted that if i made progress in study, they would give me a lot of money.
8.0	I sweared no matter how hard i would get good grades.
8.0	After that I was willingly to study.
8.0	changing many bad habits,I kept on working hard in study.
8.0	Many years laters, I did not remember whether I got the basketball shoes, but I got great benifits from the good habits.
10.0	So why s
11.0	I think it's not a good idea.
11.0	I have three reasons.
11.0	First, it is not right to give money to school-age children without considering their ages.
12.0	Children usually don't  know how to use the money.
11.0	They may use the money to buy toys, computer games, or other bad things considering their ages.
8.0	And  parents give their children money rather than gifts will destroy the relationship between parents and children.
8.0	At the age of 6-12, they'd like to get gifts with parents' love rather than things they buy on their own.
8.0	This kind of strategy to encourage students can't get the rusult they want.
6.0	Second, it's a better strategy to encourage children's progress in schoolwork.
8.0	After all, not every student could get a high grade at first.
8.0	If they feel disappointed with themselves because of not having good grades for several tests.
8.0	And their parents don't encourage them and overlook their progress.
8.0	They may don't want to study and give up.
0.0	Third, this kind of encouragement criteria means that it's the most important thing for students to get a high grade.
0.0	But I think every students has his interest.
0.0	Some students may be not good at studying the knowledge that the school gives.
0.0	And some students with gift in only one subject may feel upset for not having a high grade for every subject.
0.0	Parents should know that it's the most important things that students feel happy in school.
0.0	Children should grow up with in a good circumstance that encourages students to show their talent in their own subjects.
11.0	I hold the believe that study is a natural behavior sprird by our curiosity or need.
11.0	A good habit need to be built as it will accompany us through the whole life.
12.0	I highly doubt that to take money as award when children get good grades is a good idea.
6.0	First of all,it do harm to the developement of childrens' leaning skill.
8.0	always related hard-working to get good grade with money is not a sensible attitude for study.
8.0	Those who study for money may pay more attenion on how much they would get after those effort and for that case, he or she can hardly devoted themself into study.
8.0	This, in a long term, will become a bad mind imply.
2.0	On the other hand, money can stimutate children for a while, but human's desire can always be a black hole.
7.0	The influence brought by money will fade
11.0	With the development of our society, there is no doubt that the education system has been established extremely well, which means almost every people, whether teenagers or adults, all have opportunities to attend school.
12.0	However, how about the quality of our education and how many knowledge we can receive from the class?
12.0	This actually depend on our professors who stand on the rostrum.
11.0	Some citizens think that we should increase their salaries to make them focus more on their job.
11.0	In fact, i disagree with the opinion for the follopwing three reasons.
4.0	First of all, universities have already gave them enough salaries to sustain their even their family's life.
8.0	According to the social investigations, professors are belong to the high incoming circle, presidents or some department leaders even obtain higher salaries, which means they totally have no burden of their daily life.
8.0	Thus spending more money for them will restrict the development of other aspects, such as the dorm conditions, school environment, education facilities and so on which are significant and important too.
8.0	Thus, i suggest that universities would rather invest those aspects than increase professors' salaries.
4.0	Secondly, enhancing professors' salaries may make other faculties feel disappointed and unfair, for they devote themselves to students also but did not receive the payment they deserved.
9.0	We cannot igonore the fact that there is not only peofessors work hard in the university, but also other stuff work even harder than professors.
9.0	we should solve this issue by the direction of our investment.
4.0	Last but not the least, some professors really do not deserve those high payment, for they have never evet pay any attention to theit job.
8.0	Those so-called professors even find some graduated student to teach class, then they have enough time to do their own research, not for the development of university, but for their own fame or monetary benefits.
8.0	I have experienced such situations in my university.
8.0	There are some professors just find some movies for us to watch, then they leave and do their commercial businesses.
8.0	Sometimes they even call me and other students to help them but never no pay.
8.0	So, we should not encourage this kind of professors.
1.0	Judging from  what i have mentioned above, we really have no reason to spend more money on professors' salaries.
1.0	We actually should establish some discipline to regular thoese professors.
3.0	The issue that whether parents should reward their school-age children with money has been discussed for a long time.
12.0	And as far as I am concerned, it's a good idea to encourage children to work hard.
4.0	First, the reward like money is something that represents parents' recognition.
8.0	The high grade is got by effort, so it's not very easy to get a high mark in a school that has many excellent students.
8.0	Just like an old saying goes, there is no free lunch for you, similiarly every work deserved being paid.
8.0	So it's reasonable for parents to offer their children money for good grades.
4.0	Second, the reward like money is something that encourage them to study harder.
9.0	When getting reward after getting high mark, in order to obtain praise, they will work harder next period.
9.0	Therefore, it's a beneficial way to encourage them to be a better man.
4.0	However, this method also has some negative influences.
8.0	For example, it may give some negative mental impacts on children.
8.0	Once they don't get enough money they want for high grade at one exam, it's possible for them to give up studying hard.
8.0	What's more, they will regard the mark as the most important thing in the world, and evidently it's wrong.
7.0	I agree this idea but at the same time, parents should kno
8.0	Can you imagine what things would like to be if all children want to buy a exclusive staff such as a car which is not helpful at all to their lives just because they have a nice appearence in a television advertise?
8.0	Can you think out the consequence mimicing some extreme dangerous actions in some television ads as a child in such a young age?
8.0	The answer must be fairly serious and unexceptable.
8.0	This is because majority of children are lack of the capacity to recognize like adults or ability to control themselves perfectly and they will more likely to have more bad influences by the television ads.
8.0	So ,, should not be allowed toward children who aged 2 to 5.
6.0	Few things can be more dangerous than imitating some extreme movements in television ads as a small child.
7.0	Simply because we cannot anticipate what scene will appear on TV ads when
3.0	Nowadays, the privacy of famous people become a highly-debate topic.
11.0	some people content that entertainers do not want more privacy, and other people think that famous people also need private space.
11.0	In my point of viwe, privacy is neccessary for everybody , so i agree the statement that public people need more privacy.
5.0	Firstly, so limited privacy can result out a negetive influence on the safety of famous people.
8.0	Famous people have their own family, and the people they love deeply.
8.0	And  famous people want to protect the people they love deeply.
8.0	One way they have to do is to hace more privacy.
8.0	Bcause if a people have no private space, their information will be well-known, that would be very bad.
8.0	That is one reason why famous people deserve to have more privacy.
5.0	Scondly, famous people want to have freedom.
8.0	Pri vacy is means freedom, if a person have big private space,  he can do whatever he want to do, i believe that is everyone deserve to have.
8.0	For instance, the famous rapper PG ONE, as he become popular, there is more and more people to consider his private life, he can not hold the colorful life like other underground rapper.
8.0	the things he can do is extremely limited, even he can not go to KTV .
8.0	And he did this , then he will never be a famous people again.
8.0	So i consider that famous people need more privacy.
7.0	To conclusion, people are deserve to get freedom, although famous people is public people they are people not god, so i agree
12.0	Nowadays, many people are urgeing that if teacher should not make their social or political views known to students in the classroom.
11.0	As for me, i disagree with this statement.
11.0	The reasons are as follow.
6.0	First, i consider that if teacher tell the students about their social or politcal views, they can let students know more about the current news and extra knowledge by this means.
8.0	If teacher say something with their social or political views, it must append to the news.
8.0	In this ways, students can know more about the current news.
8.0	For instance, one of my college professor like to talk about his oppinion about the current social situation.
8.0	Through his narrate, i learn a lot of extra knowledge like why  that i don't know before.
2.0	Second, i think teacher can lead students to have the correct values.
3.0	Do you often watch movie and tv during the free time?
3.0	Do you always want to watch movies and tv during your study time?
3.0	Nowsday a lot of young people like watch movies and tv during their free time and these movies also influent the concentration when they study.
3.0	Moreover watch too much movies or the tv is not good to the cultiavate of the characteristic of the young people.
11.0	So I agree with the point that the watching movies and tv have more negative effects on the way the young people behave.
5.0	Firstly, watch too much movies or tv will have negative effects to young people's study.
8.0	It is a very important time to study knowledge when people are young.
8.0	So we may pay more attention on our acdamic assignment.
8.0	If there is a very interesting tv programm that will play soon, we may lose our concentration during the study beause at the time the thing that full of the young people is the interesting talking and plots in this peogramm.
8.0	even though these young people have not finish the assignment that the professor gave to them, They also will put the important study down and shift the attention to the tv.
8.0	It is very terrible, because of the tv programm they may stay up very late at night.
8.0	And these young people will sleep during the class or work.
8.0	So watching too much movies and tv is not good to the future of these young people.
5.0	Secondly, paying too much attention to watch movies or tv will replace the time they read book.
8.0	In the past, a lot of great people thought the books were the wealth of the life.
8.0	Reading a lot of book will expend the outlook of the young people and also in order to make them thinking.
8.0	By these way they will have their own thinking about some question and create some new things by themselves.
8.0	But if the funny movies or tv programm replace the books, these young children will never think.
8.0	And even more they just rely on the limited information from the tv or movies and do not want to learn something deeply.
8.0	It will have great negative effect to these young people's  study and work in the future.
8.0	Finally they will lose the competitive in these social and be gave up by the community.
12.0	With the quickennig pace of urban life and ever-increasing pressure,people in growing numbers are  seeking different ways to relieve their pressure,either by watching a movie or doing physical exercise.
12.0	In my opinion ,I firmly believed that it is better to relax by doing physical exercise every day.
6.0	It's generally acknowledged that good health is the key to a happy life and a successful career.
8.0	There are numerous ways of keeping fit.
8.0	People respectively choose jogging,playing basketball,swimming,skating,climbing or riding as their regular exersices because exercises never fail to make us stronger and more energetic.
8.0	as far as I'm concerned,I have a peculiar interest in yoga,an hour's practices every day alawys makes me feel healthier and more vigorous.
8.0	besides,I never touch any cigerates or wine,instead,I keep a balanced diet and  go to bed before 11o'clock every day because l think burning the midnight oil is harmful  to our health.
8.0	A sufficient sleep is indispansable to our physical fitness.
8.0	All this practices can gurantee a good health and a happy life.
12.0	I disagree with this ideas.
5.0	Adimttly, young would know more celebrities and be effected by them .
8.0	Young people always get a lots of pressure for working After a long period working, people also feel tired and sleepy.
8.0	They always watching TV showes to let them relaxed.
8.0	However, they
5.0	Firstly, celebrities will bring coloful to older people's life.
10.0	Nowadays, people live separately without their extended family, in the apartments which can only accommoddate a few people: old people always feel lonely without their childrents.
7.0	when the old people h
3.0	The favoruite way to release them varies from individual to indivudual.
3.0	Some people choose physical exercise to relax while other people prefer going to the cinema or reading a book.
11.0	In my opinion, the latter is a better way to relax yourself when you bear much pressure derived from various aspects.
4.0	Reading or watching a movie is definitely more effortless than physically exercise.
8.0	I don't deny the benefit which you can acquire after a series of exercise.
8.0	Hoever, it is evident that when most people are eager to relax themselves, they are not willing to devote additional effort to getting the relaxation.
8.0	Compaired with sports, reading or watching as an appreciating process require less actively anticipation, of course they are more effortless.
4.0	It is more effective to read a book or watch a movie than doing sports when you need release yourself.
9.0	The pressure which confuse you usually comes from your excessive speculation rather than actual problem.
9.0	Trapped in such a dillemma, nothing is better than reading or wathcing since you can search for comfort or solution from the characters in the literal works, which can't be achieved by simply doning sports.
4.0	Moreover, the reason why reading or watching is better than doing physical exercise exist also in human body.
8.0	Imagine that you are overwrought after a whole day of work, you have been extrmely exhausted in mind.
8.0	At that time, if you compell yourself to do some sports for relax, the result will only be more adverse to you.
8.0	The pressure from both mind and body can destroy you easily.
7.0	Hoever, an interesting movie or book can save you from mind or
3.0	Nowadays,with the development of economy,parents reward children's progress with money,which is more and more commen.
3.0	Although this means is controversial,I think approciate reward to the children is understandable.
3.0	Firstly,parents offer children money for high mark,which can inspire the enthusiasm of the child to learn.
12.0	Especially,for young children who are not aweare of the importance of learning,this approach allows them to understand that learning is important.
6.0	Secondly,day after day,as long as children study hard continuous,the reward money will accumulate,when the children have money,they must learn to how to use this money.
10.0	This will allow children to develop financial awareness from an early age.
10.0	Finally,money provides the child with a lasting learning motivation,and eventually lead them have an success.
11.0	an increasing number of people tent to hold the opinon that people nowadays are more willing to help the struggling strangers.
12.0	It may due to everyone suffer difficulty simlarily, so people always want to help  them to solve the problems other meet.
12.0	however, in my opinon, people today are better not to help the struggling strangers.
12.0	By examing three arugments: let struggling strangers solve their problems themselves can enhance thier ability to solve problems independly, if you want to help them hot-hearted, but it may doesn't work, and when you use your time, money, or vigor to help them also may no effects, it just waste your emotion.
6.0	in the first place, the ability to solve problems independly is very improtant for a person.
8.0	especially, when you living the society which is under intense competition.
8.0	In our study and life, there are lots of problems are waitng for us to solve.
8.0	we can not always recevie others help.
8.0	in this tent, we help the struggling strangers may meaning kill their chances to build their independent problem solving ability.
8.0	Take my friends as a example, when she was a high school student, she found herself could't solve the complex physcial questions, and during every exam, she always tent to ask her best friend to tell her the answer.
8.0	of course, she haven't pass the college entrance examination.
8.0	hence, helping other struggling strangers is not a good way to complete their ablilty to solve the problem.
2.0	furthermore, as human beings we always can not find others problems correctly, you might want to help the struggling strangers, but it doesn't work.
7.0	i, for example, when i prepared for the toefl exam, i used have no idea to complete the listening, speaking, reading and writing part, and i always want to recevie some helps from other students who passed the exam, i took their speaking and writing sample to anwser my exam, unfornutately, when i first took the toefl exam, i felt
3.0	Recently, an interesting topic has aroused a heated debate: which factor influence us most when we decide to buy something, friends' and colleagues' recommendation, information from media or comment from salesman.
3.0	The answer varies from person to person.
11.0	From my perspective, I believe that the recommendation from our friends or colleagues maybe have more postive effect on us than other factors.
5.0	To begin with, the suggestions from our friends or colleagues maybe more reliable and useful than media and salesman when it comes to a mojor purchase.
8.0	To be specific, friends are the group who definatly never cheat us and they are more likely to help to solve our problems from their bottom of the heart.
8.0	In this case, when we ask advice from them, friends tend to tell us their own experience of facing the same problems.
8.0	According to their advice, we can make right decision.
8.0	To illustrate, when I faced to buy a new smart phone, I asked suggestion from my best friend who are interested in these advanced technology.
8.0	Then he recommended me to several  phones pationtly, such as HuaWei P9, IPhone 8,  based on my preference.
8.0	Eventually, when I got my new phone, I found it is really great and I like it so much.
8.0	Without my friends recommendations, I never make the right decision like this.
5.0	However, the information from media and the comment from salesman may exaggerte.
8.0	This is because the information can be from the product industry and they will spead some exaggerate message to lead people to buy them in order to make more profit.
8.0	Similarly, the salemen also want to make more money by over-pride their product and make some fake information about the product.
8.0	Therefore, the message from media and salesman is not as accurate as from our friends.
8.0	For example, last year my father wanted to buy a new TV and he went to a market.
8.0	At that time the saleman always prided their product and underestimated other brand of TV.
8.0	Thanks to the recommandation from his friends given him before, he found the saleman exggerate about the TV and he left that market.
2.0	To sum up, It is advisable to follow the recommendation that given
12.0	As our pace of life more and more faster, focus guadully shift on how you can work productive.
12.0	the same phnomenon still exists in campus, like when teachers assign projects, and you must work together.
12.0	Is this way should led you learn much more effectively than when you are asked to work alone on projects？
12.0	in my views, the work that you finished with your patters is more benefit than you work alone.
6.0	As the idiom says: one  tree cannot makes the forest, as for us, isolated efforts are not much value for team effects.
10.0	Thus, work together could perfect ones opinion and cover the shortage.
7.0	for       example, when o
12.0	I this is a not a good idea.
8.0	A student study in school and do homework everyday.
8.0	So they should get good grades.
8.0	Parents just should pay the cost of study.
8.0	If a student get good grates,parents can encourage him or he.
8.0	But if the parents give the money to this students,he or she may will get some bad habits or ideas such as:spend money freely.
8.0	Sometimes they may ask parents for more and more money.
8.0	If their parents refuse their idea,they may do some terrible things such as steal money from parents,classmates or someone else.
8.0	And a student should to remember then are studing for themselves not for their parents or money.
8.0	If a student get good grades their parents can take them out for a trip or buy a little gift for him or her but not money to a student.
3.0	Teachers in modern school are more likely to assign projects which should be accomplished by a group of students.
3.0	Each of the students in groups have their own tasks and an ultimate work will be shown in presentation.
3.0	However, many experts now discussing about the effectiveness of group work of students.
4.0	Some of the experts doubt that students may lost motivation if they join a group because some of them may be lazy to do their works, or some group leader are not responsible to the result of their groups leads to the lost in the presentation.
8.0	If all of the groups have those kinds of student, The whole quality of the assignment will worse than the alone assignment.
8.0	I totally disagree with it for these are just happen in specific condtion.
8.0	If students wants to get high GPA , they should work hard in all kinds of studies.
8.0	And group leader will be elected by their group members, so he will be the people with highest leadership ability.
8.0	So the effects will promote the quality of final result
4.0	In addition, in many schools, teachers will give in some hand-outs to those groups and it indicates all the requirements of the assignment.
8.0	Each members in the group must have sufficient works to do.
8.0	For instance, In my school, the EAP teacher assign a work to show our linguistic abilities.
8.0	Our group get the title about food security.
8.0	The hand out gives us all the points we should propose and the detailed steps of the work such as the date of preparation and presentation.
8.0	Though one of my groups leader doesn't want to do tasks and he wants to tell leader not to give him mission.
8.0	Our group leader refused it because each one get the same amount of tasks, none of us can cheat for the final GPA.
4.0	Furthermore, group study enables study from each other and cooperation.
8.0	Each tasks have connections to others.
8.0	When I do my own search and propose my own opinion.
8.0	I can also listen to others' suggestions and we can have discussion for better result.
8.0	Thus, when  the ultimate assignment is shown, it combines opinions of each group members and it must be better than all of our single opinions.
8.0	Isn't more effective.
1.0	In conslusion, Group study allows us to  be part of it, and we can do mission we specialize,lazy is not exist and we can also learn from eachother.
1.0	That's the reason why it is more effective than working alone.
10.0	planning carefully
10.0	the best solution
8.0	1. take more perspective into consideration == think as a whole == make sure no mistakes == ...
8.0	2. uitilize as many resources as possible
8.0	concession
12.0	To cope with problems, people always want to find the best solution, which, in my opinion, is the solution that is beneficial from a broad perspective.
12.0	As a result, the decision makers should calm down and plan very cautiously, allowing them to conclude the best solution.
5.0	First of all, a waterproof plan enable people to avoid mistakes that did not taken into account.
8.0	To be specific, when the leaders are planning,  they are prone to take into consideration as many perspectives as possible, allowing them to see the big picture of the problem.
8.0	In other words, they will assume every possible mistakes and outcomes the potential solutions would result in.
8.0	In consequence, they would make sure little, if any, mistakes would be caused by the solution.
8.0	On the contrary, if leaders come up with a solution out of creativity without serious check and consideration, the solution is likely to cause some outcomes that not only unable to address the existed problems bring about worse troubles.
8.0	Microsoft, the worldwide technology corporation that is well known for its seriousness, is a great point.
8.0	Ten years ago, Microsoft produced popular phones of high quality, which is the result of carefully planning and arrangement.
8.0	However, to compete with another phone company Apple, Jacob, the chief technology leader who in charge the produce of the Microsoft phone, designed a creative phone within two months, which was so aggrasive that it was produced without carefully consideration.
8.0	However, the phone ended up with low market behavior because it is uncomforable to use despite tis nice looking, and forced the company to quit from the profitable market.
5.0	Besides, planning carefully make the solution feasible to conduct.
8.0	To illustrate, planning ensure the process of making solutions transparents for everyone, instead of made by the chief leader.
8.0	people are able to participate in the procedure of the discussion of the solution and come up their own ideas.
8.0	Even if most of the ideas would not be added into the solution, but it makes the solution more solid as a combination of ideas of all the stuff.
10.0	To sum up, we should plan carelly.
3.0	In nowadays there's a very interesting topic which rose the public attention.
3.0	"""It is better to relax by doing physical exercise rathe than by watching a movie or reading a book?"""
11.0	Some people agree with this statement.
11.0	They figure that they can get a lot of fun during the physical exercise.
12.0	However I stand in the opposite site.
9.0	In my point of view.
9.0	Watching a movie or reading book is much better than doing physical exercise.
4.0	First, You will have more private space when you reading a book or watching a movie.
8.0	It is true that most of us can not afford the physical exercise devices which means if you want to take physical exercise, you have to go to public weigh room.
8.0	Then you have to go talking with people.
8.0	And some people enjoy the pop,loud music when they are doing exercise that might trully be interrupted.
8.0	Unlike doing physical exercise.
8.0	You can get more pravicy when you chose to watch a movie or read a book.
8.0	For instance You can just take out a book from your book shelf in your home or turn on your computer which is convinient and easy.
8.0	You just can do all of this at home.
8.0	And to be honest home is the most private and relaxed place.
4.0	Second, Waching a movie or reading a book can get more relax to the body.
8.0	Imaging of you were working all day to finish your assignment.
8.0	You'll be extremely tired and truly want to get some rest.
8.0	If you choose to do physical exercise that means you can not get rest for your body.
8.0	Adversly, you'll be more exhausting.
8.0	But if you choose to read a book or watch movie lying on bed that will be much more comfortable.
8.0	And I will be very delightful from the exciting plot in the book I've read.
4.0	But we have to admit that doing exercise truly has some merits.
8.0	Personally, I really like to play soccer.
8.0	When I tend to get  some fun.
8.0	I sometimes would like to choose play soccer.
8.0	Because I can forget all the hard assighment when I am playing soccer.
8.0	Playing soccer truly can relax me a lot.
1.0	Overall, It is true that these two options both are very great ways to get relax.
1.0	But based on the privacy and my body situation i wouild like
12.0	Some people think that Television advertising firected toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
8.0	However,I have a different ideal.
8.0	When a young children watch television with him parents,them have to look advertising ,parents with young children is equal, people can have fun in television advertising.
8.0	why can't young children find fun in television advertising    Furthermore,I think directed toward young children should launch television advertising that adapt to young children.
8.0	Make them have fun,Make them get knowlege in Television.
8.0	Rather than television advertising direvted toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed
12.0	Exactly,I don't agree with this idea so much.
8.0	It's not normal.
8.0	My reasons are as follows.
8.0	In the first place,everyone has his or her only widsom,in another word,everyone does well in a certain aspet.
8.0	It's account to that,in the school,not everyone will have good marks.
8.0	But if this idea turns into a fact,the students will have no enough nutrition,It only contribute to lower and lower marks.
8.0	It's like a bad circle.
8.0	Secondly,high-mark students are the small part of all students,which means a large number of school-age children don't have the money they really need.
8.0	The last but not least,the test and the mark are just set to relatively access the master in a short period of a students,it's not a authority.
8.0	We can't judge the ability of a student by this way.
8.0	To improve my reasons,I will give some examples now.
8.0	I am a fresh man,which reveal that I was just go to the college by a big test.
8.0	To my surprise,a great number of my students whose behivor is always pretty were left behind in this competation.
8.0	This condition shows that good-behivor students won't always get high grades .
8.0	But if the parents give their child money by their marks,it is not so fair to the good-makr children.
0.0	So all in all,in my opinion,this idea and this conduct are not acceptable because it is not fair not only to the nice students but also the bad-gread students.
0.0	When in comes to the monthly money,I think that don't give much more money to a students for that as a student,learning to arrange thier limited money is a preparition to their future in the society.
0.0	In conclusion,the mark is absolutely not the only standerd to a stuednt's behavior at school.
10.0	Don't give school-age children mony for each high grade.
3.0	Rencently, people treat education attitute become more and more important, parent begain think of various ways to improve their children's scores.
3.0	The one of the method is that give some money to their children for each high grade they get in school, in response to this phenomenon different people holds different views.
3.0	Some people this is a good idea, because it can encourage child to get high mark, but others thinks that is not benifit for students.
12.0	For me , I approve this idea.
4.0	First of all, parent offerring some money to their children can incentive their child to study hard.
8.0	When children get a great grade, parents should praise them and reward them.
8.0	So children will know work hard is worth, and next they also want to get a high mark.
8.0	Because if parents reward students much money, child can buy something they want to have.
8.0	For example, when I was a pupil and I got a good score with math, my mother was very happy and award me some money.
8.0	I use this money brough some toys, since that I became more hardly study.
8.0	Because that will let child know study hard can exchange the things they like, which will motivate children's enthusiam for learning.
4.0	Another reason is that the financial ability is very important in morden society, award some money to children can cultivate the children's ability to manege their money.
9.0	My uncle, cousin's father, he is a merchant, so he pay attention on my cousin's financial ability, so he think a good idea is offer cousin money for each high grade they get in school, that can make cousin get a good mark and also can cultivate his ability to manage his money.
9.0	later, when my cousin become a adult, he have a stronger ability about financial, that help he a lot in his daily life, and find a good job.
4.0	It is undeniable that give a lot of money to child may lead they think the learn's meaning is to get some money, and misunderstand the study's real meaning.
10.0	But I think only parents can ask children better, I think children will not to misunderstand, and can still hardly study.
2.0	All in all, to give some money to children to encourage their get a high grade is a good idea, because that will motivate children's enthusiam for learning and make they more hard study, also that can cultivate the child's financial ability, so I think this is a good idea for children.
12.0	As for the topic about the children's education, there arises a debatation whether parents should let children make mistakes or hold them on your hands.
11.0	Basicly I vote for the first opinion.
11.0	Several reasons strongly support my point of view.
11.0	Firstly, there is no such thing that is more essential than liberty even if we are talking about a kid.
12.0	Secondly, let children go may strengthen their sense of responsibility.
10.0	What's more, a mistake may be a greater teacher than anyone.
4.0	As for the liberty, I won't talk about how much effort has been devoted to and how long have people fighted for it.
8.0	If we are too patient to allow children do what they are willing to do, there would be a desperate influence on them that the freedom is not worthwhile to possess.
8.0	That would be a terrible consequence.
8.0	When they grow up and become an adult, they may not be equipped with a mind of liberty.
4.0	Secondly, the actions of setting children free will develop their own sense of responsibility, which is more important than prevention for just several small mistakes.
8.0	Imagine that you were a little kid going outside to buy a bag of suger with no guidence of parents.
8.0	You may miss the way, nevertheless, every footstep is taken by your feet and you will find the right path sooner or later.
8.0	That makes you prouded of yourself and you will eventually remember the way you go.
4.0	If you are still worry about the mistakes a children will make, there is an old saying that mistakes are the best teachers.
8.0	I am totally agree with the idea.
8.0	A parent may be able to protect a kid from the hurt for a while, but can he stay besides his kid for a whole life?
8.0	Indeed he can't.
8.0	Thus if he hold the kid tightly, the kid won't remember anything and he will make the same mistake anytime the parent is not nearby.
8.0	But if he lets his kid go, the kid will remember it even though he may get injured.
1.0	In conclusion, it is ridiculous that the parents don't let their children do anything they are willing to do.
1.0	The best way of education is to let go.
3.0	Nowadays more and more people come to realize the important roles of teachers played in one's whole life.
3.0	Some people claim that teachers ought to get paid as much as doctors, lawyers or business leader.
11.0	And I could not agree with it more, my reasons and examples are given below.
5.0	To begin with, teaching is not a easy job, and teachers get heavy work almost every day.
8.0	Since one teacher teaches more than one class which contains at least thirty students, they will have a lot of homework to check every day while preparing for the classes in the next day.
8.0	So teachers are very likely to stay up late to finish their work just like some doctors on the night duty.
8.0	To illustrate, my neighbour is a Chinese teacher in a primiry school.
8.0	She taught three classes last year, and she always had to check her students' writings till two o'clock in the morning.
8.0	As a result, she fell ill at the end of the semster and had to stayed in hospital for a month.
5.0	Moreover, the teachers receive a lot of pressure from their work just as the doctors, lawyers or business leader do.
8.0	It is because the parents have a high expectation  ontheir children, and teachers are supposed to teach students in a more prefect and effective way.
8.0	Only after the students can get good grades in the exam and be distinguished from their peers, will the parents be satisfied with the teachers.
8.0	Take my English teacher as an example.
8.0	The average score of my class did not reach the parents' expectation, so many of my classmates' parents complained to the schoolmaster about it.
8.0	And in the end the teacher was fired because of my class's low English test scores.
7.0	It is true that occupations like doctors, lawyers or business leader are quite tiring when compared to most jobs in the society, however, the
11.0	In my opinion, give shcool-age children money for their high grade they get in school is not a good idea.
11.0	I agree that give some awards to encourage children is a good way, but the award should not present as money.
12.0	In the form of textbooks, nrovel, toys could be a good choise, but not the money.
4.0	Fistly, parents could not control the use of money.
8.0	They could not predict what children would do using these money.
8.0	For example, the children may use the money to buy expensive toys or hang out with firends.
8.0	But parents have no control of these money.
4.0	Secondly, use money as an award also encourage cheating.
8.0	In order to get the money award, children may use different measures to cheat in the exam in order to gain the money award.
8.0	This raise a bad atomsphere between classmates.
8.0	In this way, the children may become dishonest.
8.0	But when the award is replaced with some helpful toys or textbooks, it will lessen the posibility of cheat.
4.0	Finally, give children a specific award can help parents gain more control with the grow of their children.
8.0	If kids like instruments, parents could offer piano or guitar as their high grade awards.
8.0	Otherwise if children like science, parents could offer some scientific toys or science fiction books for them.
8.0	Using these stuff as an award is clearly a better choise.
1.0	All in all, I think give money to children is really not a good idea.
1.0	I prefer use specific awards instead.
3.0	Nowadays, internet play an important part in our life and it create mount of convience for us.
3.0	In this way, we can get more information quickly.
3.0	But some people claim that too much imformation give to people wil create plenty of problem like sical chaos or violent accident.
11.0	In my opinion, more information given to people is more help for to human's development.
5.0	First at all, no one can disagree with when we get more information in ourselves specific department is helpful to us to get success.
8.0	In modern century, we more rely on the information from internet that the book from libraries.
8.0	Because with the computer, people will get information directly and without walk around in library for search the book they want, when they finally found the book, some time they will know the book did  not including the information they want after read it.
8.0	But with internet we don't need spend time to search the book and can also know the information the passage including through the conclusion from other people.
8.0	For example, last year, I have to finish my term paper about behavorism, but In the library, I spent a lot of time but I only found a book about cogntive theory.
8.0	I have no way to choose, so I use the internet to find the information I want, and I get it quickly.
5.0	Second,more information given to people, people will understand the different type of knowledge and understand each other.
10.0	For example, if a person don't know any thing about other conturies, they will treat foreign people with a rude way because of culture different.
10.0	In conclusion, I think inter
11.0	I am disagree it is better to relax by watching a moving or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.
11.0	Doing exercise is good for our body,can make me strong.
11.0	I do not think watching a movie is not a good way to relax!
4.0	First,when we do some exercise,such as playing baskerball or playing football.
8.0	They can help us to prectic our body can lead us to healthy.
8.0	In Amercia,there are many sports team in a school.
8.0	when the student finish all the class,thy can come to the playground and enjoy themselves.
8.0	So ,if you stay in a place for many hours,i think is not good for your body because you have been study for one day ,you need time to relax。This is not conducive to bone growth!
4.0	Second,there are many people wear glasses,because you spend many time on your book or cellphone .
8.0	You can not keep one thing for a long time .
8.0	I think  doing exercise is a good way .
8.0	You can relax you eyes and other bodys .
8.0	Dont you think doing exercise is a good way ?
4.0	Third,doing some exercise is a good way make youself strong .
10.0	If you are very thin and short ,you need play basketball to make you grow and going to gym almost three times a week ,do it can help you become strong and have a good shape !
10.0	So ,i think dong exercise is very good wa
3.0	Nowadays, With the competion of work harder and harder, people must choise the lifestyle to relax by themslves.
3.0	And there are a varity of methods to relax.
3.0	Such as watching a movie, reading a book or relax by doing physical exercise.
3.0	All methods owning a lot of fans and they all said that their relaxed ways is the best.
12.0	For me, of course I have my way to relax and I think both watching movies , reading books or exercise are great methods and there is no comparitive.
5.0	About watching a movie or reading a book, It has advantages and disadvantages.
8.0	For the advantages, First when people watching movies and reading books.
8.0	They always seat of even lied on the sofa or bed so the body will feel total relax because they have no action at that time so body can charge energy.
8.0	"Second people can obtain a lot of knowlegde so actually people didn't waste time even you can call this ""study""."
8.0	But this way also has disadvantages.
8.0	If one penson's work is seat on chair and use the computer, and he choise watching movies to relax himself then for a lonng time maybe his body may getting weakness and it will cause lots of trobrom.
8.0	For example, he will easilly get disease.
5.0	Another way of relax, doing physical exercise.
8.0	For the advantages, of course it could increase the strengen the power of people's body and when people finish the exercise they will find emergy fill over in their body.
8.0	But exercise only improve the body.
8.0	it has no benefit for people's mind.
8.0	For a loong time ago, you will find you only have a strong body.
2.0	conclusion the oponions that has be mention, I can say relax is a large thing in your life and you can't dismiss, so the best way is to do the both methods.
3.0	Have you ever seen that some students are overwhelmed because they need to study too much courses?
11.0	The anwser is definitely yes.
11.0	Some people in the society think that the more courses students study, the more brillient they are.
11.0	When it comes to the opinion that students should not take additional courses, like history, in order to pay more attantion to their majors, I strongly agree.
11.0	There are three aspects that can help me to illustrate my idea.
5.0	First of all, taking extra courses will make students cannot focus on their major couses.
8.0	I mean they have to use the time that used to study their majors to study history courses.
8.0	It might make students cannot study and understand their major courses deeply and they will be more pressured.
8.0	For instance, when I was in middle school, the headmaster decided to let all the students to study politial class after the first acdemic year.
8.0	In the first acdemic years, politial class was a selective course.
8.0	When it become compulsory course, we had to use the time that used to study chinese, math, Engilsh to study politial class, even we needed to use our break time, like sleeping or lunch time.
8.0	Also, all students feel much more pressure because of the plantiy of homework.
5.0	Furthermore, the purpose that the university force students to study history must be that university wants to let students to obtain more knowledge and know more about their culture.
8.0	But I thinks most of the students have absolutely know the knowledge that a citizen need to remenber.
8.0	More specifially, undergraduate students have already access some important history events though all kinds of media, like computer, cell phone, television and so on.
8.0	It is unnecessary to force students to study history because it just can bring more pressure to students.
3.0	In regard to the topic of this question.
3.0	There are many people think we should watch a movie or read a book.
11.0	While the other people think we should do physical exercise.
12.0	This is very diffcult to choose.
11.0	In my opinion, when i feel relax, i will do some physical exercise.
4.0	Doing execrises offer many benifits to our body.
9.0	If we always watch television or read a book and we dont usually take execrise that there will often lead to a number of health problems such as high blood pressure, heart diseases.
9.0	So, to be albe to take relax and also maintain the health body, we should take some arobics like running yoga etc.
4.0	Otherwise, execrise could help me to release the stress.
8.0	According to research of science, people who dont like taking execrise have more higher rate to take suiside.
8.0	Because we have so much stress in our daily life.
8.0	whereas, taking execrise is a very important way to release ourself.
4.0	Finally, some forms of execrises encourage socialization and team work, which is a much greater way to relax than being alone.
10.0	Example, we often play soccer with our friends, in this activity, people meet and play as a team share happiness with each other could achieve much higher enjoyment and satisfaction.
2.0	At last, we should take a balance  with  execrise and re
3.0	Offer the school-age children money is not a good idea.
12.0	Where are they going to spend money?
8.0	Are they going to some game store to buy some games.
8.0	School-age children often do not have ability for self-control.
8.0	So people should not offer money for school-age childrten.
8.0	People should know there are many choice fro the prize ,like take him to watch the movie or buy a gift for him, but give children money is definitely not a good idea.
8.0	This will make children get a lot of bad habitats, parent should know the right way to teach children.
8.0	The school-age children should get high grade.
8.0	this is not for parent but  for themselves.
8.0	Parent should let them know about this.
8.0	A candy is enough for him as a prize.
8.0	Many school-age children always choose sppend money on Bar for play games when they have money, after their grade lower and lower.
8.0	that is cause by the money give by parent.
3.0	Nowdays, the news that kind people help others in need titles a lot in the internet news, it seems that struggling people get more help form the society.
11.0	personally, it is undeniable that giving strangers in hard time can make us feel better and more satisfied with our life.
5.0	Firstly, it is normal for us to help other people, each of us has a sense of sympath, especially a sense of sympath for the old and the children.
10.0	Giving those in need a first hand in time makes us feel great about ourselves, thus giving us a strong sense of pride.
5.0	What is more, knowing someone's life is much tougher than ours enables us to view the difficulties in real life more positive.
8.0	Take myself as an example, my parents had to left me in my hometown for a couple of months while they went to another country to look for jobs, i was quited sad about it which made me cry all the time.
8.0	But one day, i met a child on the street who had just lost his parents and had no place to go.
8.0	I was really sorry about the little boy, so i gave him all my pocket money.
8.0	Thinking about my parents, i felt i am such a lucky guy and felt good about the help that i offered to the homeless child.
2.0	Last but not least, i think it is vital to help those who really need our kindness, and offering morehelp to the strangers in difficult time  is disavoided.
3.0	When we talk about the courses we take in the university, many students think the major course is enough for them and there is no need for them to take history courses and so on.
11.0	However, in my opinion, the history course is as important as math course.
11.0	And no matter what our field is, we have to take the history courses in order to better understand the development of things.
5.0	In the development of the nation and the country, it is important to review the history.
8.0	And we can  summarize the experience and mistakes so that we would not make it again.
8.0	As a university students, only by taking history classes can we know the country more directely and specificly.
8.0	After that, we are more willing to devote ourselves to the subject that can benefit our society so it can help our country become more stronger.
8.0	What's more, we can also benefit from a more powerful country.
5.0	Another reason is that we shoud learn history is that it can help us understand the essence of the things.
8.0	Take my own experience for example, I am an architecture student and I have to take many history course about art.
8.0	First of all, I just thought the course was boring and it had no use to my major.
8.0	But in the end of semester, I found that I perform bad in not only the history class but also the designing class.
8.0	It's sure that I didn't get high grade that semester, but i just wonder how can it be.
8.0	I spend my most of time on my designing class but it still made no difference on my grade.
8.0	So I turn the teacher for help, she looked my picture and diagram and give me the advice that i should learn from some architecture book about what is the good architect and get some information and inspiration from it.
8.0	It just make sense, so I begin to take the history class and found it is very helpful for my major.
1.0	So as you can see, there are many advantages to take a history courses.
1.0	The university should require students to take the class since the students may not aware of the importance of history by themselves.
3.0	Have you ever seen that young children who imitate the movement in the televison and then hurt themselves?
11.0	Some people in the society think that television advertising directed toward young children not only should be allowed, but also can bring many benefitd to their children.
11.0	When it comes to the opinion that televison advertising should not be allow to ward young children, I strongly agree.
11.0	There are three reason why I insist this opinion.
5.0	First of all, I believe that children are too young to analyze the advertising in the television whther they are good for them.
8.0	Many advertisment may include violence, bloodiness, and something which will make a bad influence to children.
8.0	Children at that age are glad to imitate what they learned.
8.0	They will hurt themdselves if they imitate the advertisment which are bad for them.
8.0	For example,  if children looked an advertisment which inculde violence, manybe they will imitate it and then fight their friends, their friends will be so wondering why the children fight them and then they will fight with the children.
8.0	They will all hurt.
8.0	It is what we all don't want to see.
5.0	Second, I think that manybe children will be addicated to the advertisment and then don't want to pay attention to anything surround them instead televison.
8.0	For example, my niece is a cute girl.
8.0	She liked tomaked more friends and play with her friends before.
8.0	However, after she watched a televison advertisment of a cartoon.
8.0	She perfered to watching TV all the day rather than play a while with her friends.
8.0	When her friends came to see her, she just ignore her friends rather than play with themThen her friends were find another people who replace her.
3.0	In this diversified world, it is very normal that people have different opinions about something.
3.0	However, whenever people are asked what they should do when their teachers says something incorrect in their opinions, they usually exhibit an air of uncertainty.
3.0	Should people interrupt and correct the mistake immediately?
3.0	Should people say nothing?
4.0	Or should people wait until the end of the class or meeting when there are no people around, and then talk to the teacher or meeting leader?
11.0	In my opinion, the last choice may be the best choice.
4.0	To begin with, waiting until the end of the class or meeting when there are no people around, and then talk to the teacher or meeting leader can correct the mistake in a beneficial way.
8.0	If people do not tell the teacher or meeting learder the mistake, then they may not be aware of it.
8.0	So after the class or meeting, people can talk to them about the mistake, and this can give them some time to think about the mistake seriously and correct it next time.
8.0	And in the class and meeting, there are always a lot of people, which means time is very important.
8.0	By waiting until the end, they can save much time.
8.0	So I think this is a very beneficial way both for the teacher or meeting learder and the audience.
4.0	Then, interrupting and correcting the mistake right away may be awkward for all the people present.
8.0	There are always a lot of people in the class or the meeting.
8.0	The teachers or the meeting leaders are the symbol of authority.
8.0	If they are questioned in front of a crowd of people, not only them but also the audience may have a sense of awkward.
8.0	Moreover, it is known to all that it may not be easy to find and understand the mistake right away.
8.0	So it may take some time for the professors or team leaders to think about the mistake while the audience are sitting there doing nothing silently.
8.0	This is absolutely awkward.
8.0	In another situation, the professors or team leaders may choose to ignore the different opinion in order to save some time during the class.
8.0	This may also make the person who raise the question feel awkward.
4.0	Last but not the least, I think saying nothing is the least helpful solution.
8.0	Because if no one has the courage to point out the mistake, then the professors or the team leaders may not be aware of the mistake, which means they won't correct the mistakes and some people may learn the wrong thing.
8.0	Take my own experience as as an example, when I was in junior high school, my math teacher made a mistake during the class but no one mentioned it.
8.0	So many students get bad scores during the coming test.
8.0	So say nothing is not a good solution.
2.0	To conclude, if the teachers or team leaders made mistakes, I think waiting until the end of the class or meeting when there are no people around, and then talk to the teacher or meeting leader can correct the mistake is the best
11.0	Nowadays, people need to depend on the substance basis and they can survive in the society.
11.0	But some people do not have right concept of money, so even they own encough money, they still cannot live well.
12.0	Because money will accompany us for a long period, how to use it or manage it?
11.0	I think it is necassary for everyone to learn to how to manage money at a young age.
5.0	First, teaching children how to manage money, they can establish right perspective about money, and it can effect their future life.
8.0	When children grow up, they will have a job and own their family.
8.0	In that time, they are individuals, and they must do somethins by themselves.
8.0	If they do not have perspective about money, they cannot realize earning money is not easy, so they do not cherish the results and their thier social relationship will have negative influence.
8.0	For example, there is a boy.
8.0	When he was youg, his parents love him very much.
8.0	If he wanted to buy something, his parents must answer his requirement.
8.0	But when he grow up, his farther have sick and spend a lot of money.
8.0	In that time, he did not realize the family's situation become feasible.
8.0	He still ask her parents money like before.
8.0	Even his parents explain the situation, he still cannot understand the meaning.
8.0	One day, he did not get money from his parents, he even hit them.
8.0	Afer that, everyone heard about this thing, and everyone do not want to make friends with him.
8.0	In the end, if we cannot tell children the righ concept, the results will be terrible in the future.
5.0	Second, this way can help children develop independent personality and it can become well rounded person in the future.
8.0	Because in this process, children can realize they can individuals and they are not belong to anyone.
8.0	When they realize it, it will understand in the future they need to rely on themselves to live.
8.0	For instance, my sister manage her own money when she was young.
8.0	Now she is a universty students.
8.0	But she already do not need her parents money, they can earn their living money by herself.
8.0	Because she always manage her money, she can understand earning money is difficult.
8.0	Thus, when her classmates still depend on their parents, she start to do part time job.
8.0	In this working process, she improve her social abilities, obtain more experience and expend their field of knoeledge.
8.0	According to this example, children manage money no
3.0	the education nowadays constantly comes across varias problems.
3.0	as people`s viewpoint on education evolved over time,we came to witness some unpresidencial situations and solutions.
3.0	for instance,it`s almost no surprise to see parents reward their shool-aged children special treats like icecream whenever their exelled in the axams.
3.0	while now it has gone to a whole new level:parents offering kids money in stead of fancy treats,which is a strange phenomenon that we can`t even begin to imagine couple of year back.
9.0	frankly,i dont think it`s an appropriate thing to do,but i do approve the idea of rewarding.
9.0	it is what`s bing rewarded that bugs me.
6.0	firsly,the idea of rewarding one when one`s done an impressive job actually suit the human psychological desire to win apreciation and approvment.
8.0	by doing so can inspire one to wrok harder and work with even more preseverance.
8.0	especially kids,they already have the curious fire going,it is our job to keep it fresh,which can be achieved by rewarding them.
8.0	after being rewarded once, they will forever remember the sweet taste of victor and glory,and of course, the icecream.
8.0	gradually,they attach satisfaction and joy to success ,then attach hard wok to success,building a bridge between hard work and joy.
8.0	socondly,it`s crucial that the kids are eduacated well in fnace,so that that can make use of the money they earned.
8.0	but,unfortunately and apparently,that is not the case.
8.0	it`s too early for kids to be exposed to the finacial world,which is also what the parents are for.
8.0	speaking from experience,i have received a birthday present that ill never have a chance to use,so i sold it to others for 10 yuan,which lasted not even the entire afternoon.
8.0	i completely forgot what i bought with that 10 yuan.
8.0	i leanrt a lesson from this:kids better not be in charge of their own money.
10.0	therfore,
11.0	I agree with the opinion that parents should let chidren make mistakes and let the learn from their own mistakes.
12.0	The reason why the parents reason their children,is because that they want to prevent their children from making mistakes and waste the children's time to experience more,and then they choose to tell the children the conclusion of their experience.
11.0	In fact,this is not benificial for children.
4.0	First,if the children do not experience the same thing as the reasons are told,they are not supposed to understand what they are gonna do in the situation.
8.0	The principles that are told are not grasped as well as they realized from their own experience.
8.0	It has the same sense of the muscles memory:their memory might help them to remember this type of situation,with the real happened things.
8.0	This is as same as the functions in math,and the real applying in real life.
8.0	Without our experience,we can not apply the things we studied in textbooks and school,and they will only be principles.
4.0	Secondly,the traits and characteristics of children is playful and like to explore new things.
9.0	In this age,stop children from the process of having contact with the world,is just like doing  'capitivity' to their creative thought,and will lead to a destructive to their identity.
9.0	This will be the limit of their future that they will be afraid of creating new things.
4.0	Thirdly,their is a preverb that 'the faliure is the mother of succeed',with out making mistakes or faults,their life will be very flat,and lose many fun and joy.
8.0	For example,a parents both are scientists,planned to let their child live in an environment without any germ.
8.0	Unfortunately,their child can't prevent from contact with the outter world.
8.0	As soon as the child have contact with the air,his weak skin that lacks of immune system,directly lead him into death.
8.0	Nothing is perfect,if the children do not suffer any failures before they grow up,they will be ‘paralyze’So,the mistakes,failures and dark spots in one's life will not break one's life,but will lead them to growth.
7.0	In conclusion,parents should let children make mistake and let them lear
12.0	The idea fits in with my opinion  that children should be paid for their children's high grade, like the boss pays extra for the high-productive workers.
12.0	As the experience of educating children may vary among differente countrys because of different culture, my agreement just depends on my childrenhood.
5.0	Money sometimes means parents' love.
8.0	When I was just a small kid, my mother had suffered from a greate illness which could not take her life but torture her at her rest of life, and I was told that never try anything bothering my mother.
8.0	Even though she suffered great painness, she alway overcame it and helped me with my study, and still she promised me the prize money for my high grade.
8.0	From the persepective she tells me today, that is the compensation and she trust me that I will not waste it.
8.0	Meanwhile, the trust eabled me to learn to manage my property early, which is what I want to illusrate below.
5.0	Because of parents' trust, I can take 'plenty of ' money in control for a 10-year-old child.
7.0	At that time, I began to know that if I really look up into something, I must control my desair to buy the fried chicken sold in the school, the cartoon book sold out of school and so on,
12.0	Recently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among the public: Should people follow their dreams even if the dreams are ambitious or focus on achieving realistic goals.
11.0	Opinions vary person to person.
11.0	Some people claim that concentrating on a realistic goals is a wise choice.
11.0	However, I would stand on their opposite side and I believe that people should follows their dreams even if the freams are ambitous.
5.0	First of all, setting an ambitous goal is conducive to developing one's potential which helps to master some subjects.
8.0	It is primarily because the people would try to do their best to close the dreams, which means that the people's potential will be exploited in the process of struggling.
8.0	In the end, the people will find they has became a master in some fields.
8.0	For instance, my uncle, as a businessman, always wanted to control the market of fruits in our city.
8.0	So he researched hard in economic and then he found he have a good command of math.
5.0	Further, the people who chases an ambitious dream may have a legendary life than the people who focus on realistic goals.
8.0	This is largely because the possibility of achieving the dream is not zero.
8.0	If they encouter some chances and seize them, they will catch their dream.
8.0	And when they finished their dream, they will own a legendary life not like the other people who have a common life.
8.0	For example, my father who is scientist in a unniversity and he had a program of genetically modified foods.
8.0	It was hard to make some breakthrough in this field.
8.0	But by a mistake, a fresh idea emergied and be applied into the experiment of program.
8.0	In the end, my father succeed and received a patent.
1.0	To put in a nut shellnut, I firmly support that the people should follow their dreams even if the dreams are ambitious.
1.0	This is because an ambitious goal not only can help people to master some subjects but also help people own a legendary life.
11.0	From my perspective opinon,I agree that  parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from it.
11.0	And the reasons are as follows.
12.0	Firstly,it is universally acknowledged that mistakes can bring lessons for somebody and then he or she will have the specific experience about this area,which is the same with children.
11.0	When they make mistakes,they would learn a lot and behave better in their future.
12.0	To be brief,this theory is a commom belief when encountering falure or small mistakes.
5.0	What's more,children need to be independent and experience by themselves to know how to do and how to do well.
9.0	this can bring them much courage and let them  be more stronger.
9.0	If parents help them with their whole knowledge and experiments,children may be lazy and could not think independently and actively.
5.0	Simultaneously,if parents let children make mistakes,it can create an atmosphere which is full of love and belief.
9.0	Children may feel more comfortable and will be more emthusiastic to handle the problem.
9.0	This may bring a excellent development which is important and necessary for young people.
7.0	On top of this,the ability of jumping over obstales by oneself other than waiting parents to give them advice is a good habit that will ben
12.0	Just let your kids make mistakes   With the rapid developement of society, we have more chances to get success.
12.0	However, the chances of making mistakes are also higher.
12.0	As for the hot topic, an argument has been waged concerning about whether should we let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.
6.0	As far as i am concerned, parents should give their children a comfortable atmosphere which makes sure kids have the courage of chanlleging, even though they may make some mistakes.
8.0	First of all, as an old Chinanse saying goes' Failure is the mother of success' ,which inllustrates the great importance of making mistakes.
8.0	Then, another point worth mentioning is that only if you making enough mistakes, you should get knowledge of the significance of success.
8.0	It means geting success by following your parents' 'right' ways step by step will enforce you underestimate the meaning
3.0	There are many kinds of tasks that we should do in our life span.
3.0	Some of us may do a single type of task, whle others may do diverse tasks.
3.0	But whether workers are more delight to do different types of tasks or to do similar task all day long may be still a controversial topic.
11.0	As for me, I do believe that  doing similar tasks in a day will be more satisfied for a worker.
6.0	On the one hand, there are a few things for workers to be considered when they do similar things.
8.0	That means they will be more effective and efficient and have more time to relax.
8.0	Let me take my elder brother, who was once a worker in a factory, as an example.
8.0	His job was detecting whether there are anythings wrong in the gear production line.
8.0	Although there many different types of gear, what was lucky for him is that the designs of gears were almost the same.
8.0	The biggest difference is the size.
8.0	So, as I just said, he handled similar taks in the factory and just need to solve then same problem.
8.0	But other workers who had to do varieties of works such as cleaning and the repairing the unimportant machines was not that lucky.
8.0	They always finished their jobs one or two hours later than my brother and did not have any time to relax during the workdays.
10.0	On the other hand, doing similar jobs can
3.0	With the development of technology, people have more ways to communicate with each other, they have more chance to make new friends.
3.0	So a controversial topic arouses a debate: whether the ability to make new friends easily or the ability to maitain friendship with small group of people is more important and decide people's happiness.
3.0	Some people state that the ability to maintain friendship with a small group of people is important for them.
3.0	But I think the ability of making new friends easily bring me happiness.
11.0	My view can be illustrated as follows.
5.0	To begin with, people can extend their knowledge scope through the ability of making friends easily.
8.0	People can get know about many kinds of friends with distinct background.
8.0	With them, people are able to know many different stories about their culture and life.
8.0	On the other hand, with the ability of maintaining friendship with small group of people, they will be limited in the small group and cannot get access to fresh things.
8.0	For example, I have ever know about a friend called Cherry from Japan, she always told me the story Japan culture and life style of Japanese.
8.0	I have known much Japan civilization and a little Japannese.
5.0	In addition, people form a complete sight of the world with the ability of making new friends easily.
8.0	With many new friends, people can get a lot of insights and inspration and get know about the limitation of themsevles.
8.0	So people will respect to every people because they understand the large world and the tiny themsevles.
8.0	With the ability of maintaining friendship with small group of people, they will not get the entire thought about the world.
8.0	For instance, my sister Amy have know many friends from all over the world.
8.0	She always tell me that we should respect all livings in the world, we cannot know what they experieced all.
7.0	To sum up, the ability of making new friends eas
12.0	I think it is a good idea for children to work harder and harder in study.
8.0	Sometimes we should have something benifit to us to reach our goals.
8.0	Although it is like a commerce between us and parents.
8.0	When I was a primary student, my fathere usually bought the sweet canides to me when each time I got the high marks in quizees and test.
8.0	Also, everytime I worked hard because of my lots of sweet candies after the tests.
8.0	It was so great when I got high marks!
8.0	Not only my fathere gave the present to me , but also the other parents give the presents to their childs.
8.0	The school's teacher also encouraged the parents to give the parents to their children who got the high marks in school.
8.0	If the parents can do the encouragement will in children, it will encourage them a lot when they do the things.
8.0	The most important things about the prestents that the parents can not give a lot of money to be presents, because they do not know will the money going and what will the childs do to those money.
3.0	I feel so surprice when I see the question.
3.0	I think at present people do not care able the willing to help others.
3.0	We always hear that help others is do harm to yourself.
3.0	As we all known, the cold winter in social relationship is coming.
11.0	We cannot help others as soon as possible because we spend time to self-assissment.
5.0	I don't want to say that we are less willing to help strangers.
8.0	But we need more and more power to make the choice to help others.
8.0	"I hear a joke that ""If I only have 200 dollors per year,can I help you?"""
8.0	We cannot find out whether the strangers need help in body or in money.
8.0	Be a kind man in the real life is far more difficult than before.
5.0	But it is easy for us to get help in the net.
8.0	We use the financing net when our friends meeting the terible problem.
8.0	My classmate get 100000RMB in the financing net.
8.0	He don't know who help him becausl people give 10RMB or 100RMB to fix the big price.
8.0	It means nothing when we spend 10RMB to a peopel who has a dream or who is meeting a terible illness.
8.0	We help others is  base on we know the true.
0.0	It is hald for me to say agree of not with that question.
0.0	The colorful world deceive our eyes and  we don't know what is true.
0.0	We find a people really need help in a very short time, we all be willing to help them.
0.0	Everyone have the helpless situation and  we all want a strangers help when we feel tired.
0.0	We all want to give warm to strangers ,but we don't want to give warm to snakes.
11.0	I disagree with the statement that, in twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.
11.0	These are the reason why I disagree with this statement.
4.0	First, the future world will have the kinds of energy which are more clean than today's.
8.0	For example, the solar energy  is a kind of energy which can be used in twenty years.
8.0	There are some race cars in today's world use the solar energy, and they could run to 220 kilometers each hour.
8.0	In the future, the coefficient of utilization will be more useful than today's solar panels.
8.0	The hydrogen-drive vechles are also feasible.
8.0	We all know, if you plus hydrogen to the fire, there will be a lot of water comes out.
8.0	So the hydrogen-drive vechles' effluent will be the water.
8.0	And if you electrolysis the water, you will get the hydrogen and the oxgen.
8.0	And then plus a bit fire, you will get the water again!
4.0	Second, in the future, the cars will be the multipurpose.
8.0	They would flys, runs or even swims!
8.0	So the roads won't be the only  tracks for cars!
8.0	So, you would see that, there will be more cars in the sky, on the land or even under the water!
4.0	Third,in the next future, the space technology will take the great progress.
10.0	Peo
12.0	Above all, I don't think offering school-age children money for each high grade is a good idea.
12.0	Firstly, parents should give more and more money to a child.
8.0	When a child gets high grade in school for the first time, his parents give him a sum of money.
8.0	However, when he gets high grade for the second time, he will ask his parents for more money.
8.0	It's an endless affair, and parents cannot reject.
5.0	Secondly, children who gain money after getting high grade might have a money-oriented opinion.
8.0	Actually, the most important purpose to study is to achieve knowledge.
8.0	However, for these children, they have good chances to become people who do everthing for money only.
8.0	Now they study for money.
8.0	The only reason they are willing to study is that they can get money.
8.0	I think it's an abnormal value.
8.0	Offering children who get high grade in school money is bad to their development.
5.0	The last but not least, as school-age children, they don't have too much comprehension on money.
8.0	They might think that gaining money is so easy that they will not value the chance to get a job in the future.
8.0	They may not glad to do some works with high workload when they grow up, because they will compare these jobs to their experience in school lives.
8.0	Therefore they cannot accept such high-workload jobs.
0.0	To sum up, I think that offering school-age children money for each high grade they get in school is not a good idea.
0.0	There are a lot of useful methods to cultivate school-age children's learning enthusiasm.
0.0	Therefore, in my opinion, we should not be restricted to this way.
0.0	School-age children are experiencing a golden age in mental development, so it's necessary to pay attention to the surroudings which may affect them.
12.0	I agree with let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.
10.0	It seems to me that all people will make mistakes , no matter who he or she is.
12.0	So instead of letting the kids make mistakes ,but they don't know where it is.
12.0	It is more better yet ,let them learn from their mistakes and grow in mistakes.
6.0	As a example ,if the chlidren make some mistakes ,but they don't pay attention to the what is wrong, than they will make the same mistakes at the next time .
8.0	Anyway ,that is bad behavior .
8.0	So we should to correct the child's mistakes.
8.0	So that they don't make the same mistakes next time.
8.0	Than they will know what's right,and what can be done,or what's wrong,and what can't be done.
8.0	It might let the kids know the rules in the wolrd,and when they grow up they will make few mistakes.
8.0	This helps them to gain a foothold in society.
8.0	Then things that parents give to their children can come from here .
8.0	This is the way to pave the way for children.
8.0	I
11.0	I totally agree with the statement that even if we are not affected by what is happening around the world, it is extremely important to know more about those global events for the following three reasons.
4.0	To begin with, the latest events will provide us with endless topics for conversation and enable us to make more friends with the similar or different perspectives.
8.0	For example, when we go to the English corner or other organizations to meet new people, we can notice that the  most popular members are always those who are interesting to talk with.
8.0	One major reason for their charisma is their abundant knowledge of what is going on around the world.
8.0	By introducing the appealing news and exchanging with their new friends about their opinions, a lifelong precious friendship will occur.
4.0	What's more, the history repeats itself.
8.0	What is happening in other places can be reality in our lives someday in the future.
8.0	For example.
8.0	Ma Yun, the most successful businessman in China, was inspired by the rising of computer and internet in western countries and realized how important internet would be.
8.0	With such convinction, he strived with a team and eventually created Taobao, a magic online shopping website in China and successfully transformed into a celebrity highly resepected by the world.
8.0	If we can foresee the trend behind the global news, we will equip the power to change our future.
4.0	Finally, informed by the global news, we are more likely to cherish our daily life.
8.0	The theme of the world is love and peace.
8.0	However, in many places, warfare and conflicts have become the routine.
8.0	Those who are suffering in the war have no enough food to eat, no safe place to hide and are facing the fear of death.
8.0	The pictures and news we see will teach us how happy we are when there are always safe shelters and delicious food.
0.0	I believe that no news is meaningless.
0.0	Everything happens for a reason.
0.0	As long as we can discover the hidden side, we can obtain a key to success, happy life and an interesting soul.
12.0	Many people hold the view that individuals should persist their dream no matter how ambitious it is.
11.0	After all, if dreams can be control, people will not regret.
12.0	However, I support the idea that every one should concentrate on available realistic goals for these reasons.
5.0	Firstly, paying attention to realistic aims leads to satisfying our financial needs and surviving in a competitive period.
8.0	This is beacuse if poeple are more realist, they will try best to do their work.
8.0	So they may be improved in their position to get more salary.
8.0	In this case, they don't need to worry about their funding problems.
8.0	On the contrary people focus too much on fantastic dreams, they will give up to accept some jobs that not contributes their dream.
8.0	In this case, they may lose the chance to get a job to feed themselves up or have some achievement in career.
8.0	Conseuently, they may not survive nowadays.
8.0	For example, my cousin wants to be a famous singer, so she didn't study hard in econimic department in college and gave up the chance to work as a manager in Chian Bank.
8.0	Now, she needs to ask her parents for help to live in her twenty four years old.
8.0	Her ambitious dream led her problem in survive.
5.0	Secondly, ambitious dream is a waste of time and have negative impact on study.
8.0	This is because nowadays many young people have ambitious dream and they imagine the dream is more easier than it truly are.
8.0	Consequently, they always chase the dream and ignore the importance to study well.
8.0	So they may fail to be peofessional in their major and focus less on the class.
8.0	In this way, they can abandon their career and study.
8.0	On the contrary, if they can pay attention to how to learn better and what they can do to achieve progress in their study, they will be more superior.
8.0	For instance, my brother wants to be a super star, so he esacped from school and lied to parents.
8.0	Three years later, not only did he make his dream come true, but also did he fail to graduate from college.
8.0	So dreaming ambitiously can waste their time and occupy their learning time.
12.0	In my opinion, television advertising directed towar young children should not be allowed, because the varible commodity will lure the children, mislead the children and make mental shadow to the kids.
4.0	Firstly, the Varible commodity will lure children.
8.0	There are a lot of goods advertise in the television, that will attract the children.
8.0	For example, If children see a toy advertisment in the TV, they will be lured and very want to buy it.
8.0	Children who aged two to five do not build their independent thinking, they are very easy to lead.
8.0	Sometime the advertisment will use hypoble devise to describe the commodity and attarct people to buy it.
8.0	Aults kown that is not true, is only the literature devises, but children are different, they believe what advertisment very easily.
8.0	Advertisment sent message to the childred without resistant and lure children to buy it.
4.0	Second, Advertisment will mislead children sometime.
8.0	For instance, some advertisments use some extreme ways to pubilc their productor.
8.0	They sent the information to the kids, there is nothing can not be solved by money.
8.0	When kids see this kind of advertisment, they will be influence by the advertisment.
8.0	It will boost them build worship for the money, mislead them to a wrong way.
4.0	Finally,  some Advertisment will make mental shadow to the kids.
10.0	For example, some advertisments have violent and bloody plots.
7.0	For ault the plots maybe just little case, but for kids that is a big shock in sycological an
3.0	Some parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade(mark) they get in school.
3.0	Some people think it is very good while the other people have differrent ideas.
12.0	I think that children get money frme their parents as a ward for they get high grade(mark) in school is a good thing.
6.0	First of all, parents want to encourage their children to study hard in the school is very normal.
8.0	Children who want to get more money to pay for what they like would study hard to get high grade(mark) .
8.0	This way is very useful to improve children's interest to study in the school.
8.0	Secondly,there are too much competition is the school.
8.0	The children who do not try his best to study would left behind by others.
8.0	So children would like to study hard if he can get money from their parents and they can win the competition in scool.
2.0	In short,what I have said above is that,some parent offer their school-age children money for each high grade(mark) they get in school is a good idea.
10.0	It can encourage children to study hard in the school and do not waste their time.
3.0	In modern life, more and more people want to watch some progrems and movies in the television.
12.0	Celebrities will affect our life, their opinions will affect our opinions.
12.0	Now, more and more younger people appear in the circle of entertain or circle of athletes, they will put their own opinion up, and some fans will mimic it  deeply.
11.0	But they don't know these opinions are very evil and false.
11.0	So I think that older people's opinions of celebrities are more important.
4.0	In the first place, because younger people have some experience and more reasonable.
8.0	For example, Jackie Chan is a very famous man, we all looked his movies in the childhood, he had gone to America and approach some people who are come from various countries and have different cultures.
8.0	He has extensive horizon and rich experience in the society.
8.0	His behavior such as don't waste resourses and work hard both are traditional virtue of China.
8.0	He can tell us how to persist our determine and build a good goal in our life.
8.0	In the other hand, when our country meets some trouble such as seism.
8.0	He will do a reasonbale determine to contribute.
8.0	But other younger people maybe just appeal people in the internt without really activities.
4.0	furthermore，because some older people have sense of duty.
8.0	For example, most of older celebrities all have son or daughter, they will consider their generation's developement, their opinion will take a risk.
8.0	For example, Bruce Li is a very famous action movie star, and he has a son in the family, in that period, America is very upheavel, some younger celebrities will take parade in the street and promote lots of people all involve this activity, but they don't have worry because they don't have generation.
8.0	Bruce Li leted people carm down and chated with goverment and hold the relationship of tow countries.
4.0	Yet,  some of older people not very fashion in some new things, such as don't use technique and don't use internet, but it just an small problem.
9.0	In the overall opinion are very precise.
9.0	They can tell you which determines are correct, which determines are error.
2.0	So, I think older people are more important in the opinion of celebrities.
7.0	I agree with that parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistake。
7.0	parents can not stay with their children forever，so
7.0	i think children should be independent，and do not grow up under the  protection of your parents。To
7.0	make children independent ，parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes。
7.0	Failure is the mother of success ，we can sum up from our mistakes 。
7.0	There are many scientist success after failure ，for example the famous scientist Frank Lin ，once he did an experiment failed，and then ，he revel the mysteries on the little-known truth from mistakes and failures 。
7.0	From this setback Frank Lin came to a conciusion ，Finally he succeeded 。
7.0	Mistakes can let people independent ，independent perple can function as self-reliant people。so
7.0	i agre
11.0	I agree with the statement that parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.
11.0	Many people may think the oppisite way because they regard it as parents' resbonsibility to protect their children from making mistakes.
12.0	In this way, children can grow faster and aviod to waste time on the wrong way.
11.0	However I think the different.
5.0	First, making a mistake and learning from it will be a good lesson for children to grow and form their own view of the world.
8.0	When making a mistake ourselves, the consequnce of the mistake can make the lesson more impressive.
8.0	Because we feel the pain ourselves, we can think about the problem more deeply, so the next time we face similar situation, we can response to it correctly.
8.0	It is more important to learn the way to solve similar situation, but not to avoid it.
8.0	For example, if a child is not getting well with his friend, parents should let the boy think it himself.
8.0	Maybe he has a qualler with his friends, but he will learn to solve it himself.
8.0	In this way, he will learn how to treat his friends.
5.0	Second, parents can't always help thier children, so children must learn to make mistakes and learn form thier own mistakes.
8.0	When childen are in school camping, there are only classmates and teachers around them.
8.0	When there is some problem, children must learn to handle it out himself, aloughth them may make mistakes, but they must learn from it themslves.
8.0	When they are studying aboard, they can't get in touch with thier parents that often, they can only slove problems themselves.
8.0	They make mistakes, and then learn from it, so they can grow faster.
8.0	Parents can't always help us, so we must depend on ourselves to learn from our mistakes.
2.0	From the above reasons, we can easily conclued that parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn form their own mistakes.
7.0	It is better for their gr
3.0	Everyone need relax,expecially after a long work or study.
11.0	Not only do our brain need relax but our body also need relax.
12.0	So I diagree with the statememt that relaxing by watching a movie or reading a book is better relaxing by doing physical exercise.
5.0	It is known to all that doing physical exercise can make us feel relaxed.
8.0	Though our body might be more tired after doing physical exercise ,it can refresh our brain and make our emotion become more happier.
8.0	When we doing sports we can have fun in competion with others and compaign with friends.
8.0	This is what reading books can not give you.
5.0	Today,the average of people's weight all the word become higher than the average of people's weight ten years ago.
8.0	That is because people today do much less exercise.
8.0	When people get tired,they would like to stay at home and watching TV rather than go out for sports.
8.0	In order to become healthier people need to do sports.
0.0	Doing exercise is a team work expecially when we doing sports.
0.0	If we are under presuer or have bad emotion.
0.0	It is a good place to talk with your friends.
0.0	It is convinced that tell your unwillings to others will make you feel relax and happier.
0.0	If you stay at home all day alone you might f more tired.
11.0	I agree with the statement that life in today is easier and more comfortable than it was when your grandparents were children.
11.0	The reason are in the below.
5.0	First, in the past, when they want to connect with each other, people would go to another one's house or make an appointment to meet in a certain place, then they could talk to each other or discuss something.
10.0	"But in nowdays daily life, we have the cell phones and many social activity applications, like Wechat, QQ, Facebook, Twitter and many more else applications, and we could also have the ""face to face"" discussion by Wechat, QQ or any other social applications."
5.0	Second, in the past, in 19 centry 60th, the people who like my grandparents are lack in the transportations tool.
8.0	My grandma says that, in that periord, they couldn't see many bikes and nearly never see the cars.
8.0	As her saying, she thinks if they could take the mailman's bicycle from the school to their home, they could feel they are really very happy.
8.0	But in nowdays, the shared bikes are in everywhere in our city even the froeign countries' cities.
8.0	"And there is even also some ""shared new energy electric vehicle"" in our city."
0.0	Third, in the past, if they want to buy some things, they could only go to the stores or shops.
0.0	"And if they want to buy some foreign things, the man who says these things, it will be called the ""Arabian Night"" by other people."
0.0	But in nowdays, wh could buy some things by the network shops, and you can also buy the f
3.0	As the society developing, increasing number of parents attach great improtance to the study of their children.
3.0	It takes most time for students to study on campus.
3.0	So there are two group person who may has most influence for them, their friends and teachers.
3.0	Some people believe that friends has most influence for students because they have many common topic.
11.0	But I think teachers influence more than their peers.
6.0	Above all, teachers play a more influent role in students life because they are more experienced.
8.0	Compared with friends, the teacher experience more.
8.0	And They can give many sophisticated insights into the industry.
8.0	Their interpersonal network can help students to find a decent job.
8.0	For instance, as a student majors in Business, one of my professor influenced me a lot.
8.0	Not only did he gave me considerable academic helps, but also give me suggestions of my future career.
8.0	I took his information technology project management.
8.0	In his class, he illustrated the relevant concept in a vivid way to help us to know how to make our project measurable and deliverable.
8.0	In addision, he was also the chairman of a technical company.
8.0	So after class, if I confronted some challenge of future career, I could always ask he for some advices.
8.0	He even gave me a virtual interview, when I try to find a internship.
8.0	In this sense, the teachers gave most influence for students.
0.0	In addition, teacher teach many life knowledges for students.
0.0	Teachers also teacher some life principles for students.
0.0	In school, most students are not mature enough to tackle some problems.
9.0	It is needed to be taught by their theahcer.
9.0	For instance, when I am in primary school, my teacher told we should always keep honest and responsible.
7.0	I used
3.0	It's difinately a hard problem.
12.0	Up to almost parents educate children like this way even don't know what is the result will happened after this.
12.0	It has two positions that I will talk.
5.0	To begin with, Many parents don't help children who make mistakes, expect China.
8.0	Both of them hope children can solve problem or mistake by themselves.
8.0	Let them know what is the independent and learn it, parents cannot always stay with Children.
8.0	When Children grows up, it means does not have suggstion and supply any more in the future.
8.0	Parents predict this situation early, it led children become more powerful and independence when enter the society.
8.0	That is a hard process for the children,but it also helps them in the future at the same time.
8.0	However, Children will think parent is really serious for them, after entering the society , that all are benifical forthem.
5.0	For Chinese parents, almost them think children in this age ought to be helped by the parents.
9.0	Chilsren is the most valuable thing in their mind, even how difinately diffcult problem that they have ability to do, they must to advice their children's mind.
9.0	This kind of parent will do not disagree this statement, because it is oppsite for their mind.
1.0	Parents are not same shape and mind.
1.0	I just talk about two types of parents which are reprsentative example for this statement.
11.0	Nowadays, study is very important for everyone, and a good study way can make students study more effecintly.
12.0	There are have a lot of way such as study with group and study alone.
12.0	Many people like study alone,  they think study alone will be more effectively than study with group, because no one can interfere with them.
12.0	But l have a different ideal, l think students study with group is more effectively than study alone, because study with groups l can make a lot of firends and also l can imprve my social skills, whet's more study together is more effecient.
6.0	First,  in the group student can learn how to communicate with athors and how to make firends.
8.0	as we know, study with along is always very boring,because when l face a probelm no one can help me.
8.0	In the groups have a lot of firends.
8.0	so when we have a problem we can get help from someone and also we can discuss this problems which way is then best way.
8.0	Also we have help each others who have a problems.
8.0	By thhse ways we can get to know others and we can became a bester firends, that's way can help us learn how to communicate with others.
1.0	Second, study with groups will more effictively than with along.
1.0	For eaxmple, onece l do my homework alone, and l don't know how to do math problems, so in taht night l spend few hours do tha so l study with alone is very ineffivcientt.
7.0	But when l study with a group if l have a problems l can get someone helps, and also
3.0	In mordern society, the competition in career becomes fierce, and undoubtly, people have many pressures.
3.0	In fact, for the topic whether having a good social circle or studying hard in school, differents ideas very people to people.
11.0	However, from my opinion, the importance of these two abilities are the same.
5.0	First, studying hard in school  give people a solid theorical foundation that they will never forget.
9.0	Needless to say, the knowledge that students obsorbed in class will accompany them forever, and the more basic knowledge they accumulate, the more aspects they can use this knowledge.
9.0	For example, bussiness man need basic knowledge about economy; scientists like physicians need knowledge about basic formula and  theory, and teachers need knowledge about how to educate children, so although in different careers, people still need foundamental knowledge as a support.
5.0	However, we cannot ignore the ability to relate well to people.
8.0	In morern society, have a good social circle is important.
8.0	Take my sister as an example.
8.0	When she was graduated, she could not find a sitable job; however, one of her best friends was working in an advertisment company, and she accomodates my sister to the company.
8.0	Luckily, because of the recommendation, my sister succussfully got the job.
8.0	After entering that company, my sister also had problems about how to advertise the products about toys.
8.0	Again, my sister's roommate was a salesman on TV, so he helped my sister make an advertisment on TV.
8.0	Finally, all the problems are solved.
2.0	To sum up, we cannot labal that only studying hard in school is important, because the ability to rela
11.0	In my opinion,I confirmly agree with the statement that it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.
11.0	There are three reasons to stick on my opinions.
4.0	First,if we want to relax ourselves,we should make our body and mind all to be free.
8.0	Watching a movie or reading a book is helpful to release our pressure and bring our enjoyment of art.
8.0	But physical exercise increases body pressure and even be harmful to humans.
8.0	People prefer to watch movie and read a book in a quiet place,the place is somewhere a peaceful and comfortable room.
8.0	People feel relax when they stay in a peaceful and comfortable place.
8.0	And if you want to do physical exercise,you can not calm down youself and you must be a highlighted body and mind pressure.
8.0	It looks no use for your relax.
4.0	Second,the more we watch movies and read books,the more knowledge we earn.
8.0	A man's life is a constan learning life.
8.0	We use our eyes to see books,use our ears to hear voices and movies and books are helpful for our acknoeledgement of wisdom.
8.0	People feel happy and relax when they earn new knowledge and new skills.
8.0	What makes people feel relax is they have achieved a gaol and learn somrthing new.
8.0	Learning knoeledge makes me feel happy and relax.
4.0	Third, as all people have known,comedies and joker books are famous all over the world.
8.0	People enjoy the actor's ridiculous performance in movies and the ridiculous chapters in books.
8.0	It is generally believed that when people are laughing,they will feel realx.
8.0	Laughing loudly can help people decrease their pressure and make them feel relax.
8.0	The more you laugh,the more relaxed you will be.
1.0	All in all,I believed in my suggestions that it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.
1.0	We should relax both our body and mind instead of just releasing our pressure on mind.
12.0	When talking about the television advertising aimed at young children, some people may think that it is a good idea, while other people hold the belief that it should not be encouraged.
11.0	As for me, I assert that it will do harm to the young children physically and mentally.
5.0	Concerning the physical health of the young children, the television advertising definetely has a negative effect on it.
8.0	The advertising usually ignores the misguiding effect it may bring about to the young children.
8.0	The advertising would makes the children to get addicted to watching television, since they are too young to obtain the ability of self-control.
8.0	Nevertheless,Chilren aged two to five are unable to acquire a developed cognition, which means they tend to immitate the imagitive function described by the advertising.
8.0	For instance, I have read on newspaper that a little boy who got obssessed by the flying ability of the superman in the TV advertising, then he imitated the motions of the superman and jumped out of the window on 23 floor, leading to his death.
5.0	The second is about young children's mental health.
8.0	In order to sell more products and gain more profits, the advertising would use various methods to attract children's attention.
8.0	It always describes the commodity as a luxurious one, which may mislead the children to generate a thought that I must have one.
8.0	As an result, an atmosphere of competence in appearence may spread among the children.
8.0	This could do harm to the children's mental health and aid in growing incorrect value.
2.0	In conclusion, young children should not be the audience of television advertising, since they are too young to distinguish right from wrong and are not able to control themselves in an effective way.
3.0	There are some celebrities reach a high achievement in their own field, thanks to their special childhood experience such as a good habit.
3.0	To illustate, Wait Disney, an American entrepreneur, is also a pineer of the American animation industry.
3.0	Some record shows that his creation of the distingshed and famous character that MIickey Mouse because of his imagine at a really young age.
11.0	Therefore, I certainly agree with the statement that children are supposed to learn how to manage their own money when they are young.
5.0	First of all, some experience when individuals are young will make a big difference on their whole life an account of the subconsciousness.
8.0	To illustate, an outstanding educational reformer had the assertion that he encourages parents to cultivate their children's hobbies and preference when they are young.
8.0	This is because the subconsciousness that builds up in their childhood will accompany with people's whole life and it is extremely difficult for individuals to forget.
8.0	Based on the theory, take myself for example, I were interested in painting when I was young.
8.0	With time going by, I had not painted for several years.
8.0	But one day, when I draw a picture, I found that I still could draw a beatiful and attractive composition.
8.0	Therefore, the subconsciousness that build up at a young age is really important and necessary for everyone.
5.0	On top of that, gaing a comprehensive and sophisticated understanding of a development of some issus demands some time even or several years.
8.0	Thereby, if a child want to become financially responsible adults in the future, the prerequisite for the child is to learn to manage his own money at a young age.
8.0	This is not uncommon to discover that shaping a specific or obtaining a permanet habit needs a long time.
8.0	As a result, foresting a right value of managing money should be implement as soon as possible, espacially at a young age.
8.0	And after several years when people gain more knowledge about the value of managing money, they will be capable to become a successful finanically respomsible adults eventually.
2.0	In conclusion learning to managing money not only can help children to establish a desirale conception of money, but also is benefial for their future career.
10.0	Hence, I
3.0	The objects  in the world are variety, and there is all kinds of work we ought to do.
3.0	Some people would like to choose to have many types of tasks to complete, whereas others prefer to cope with the similar tasks all day long.
3.0	From my perpective, I wll choose to deal withe different kinds of tasks.
4.0	First and foremost, working with many types of tasks can make us less tired.
8.0	Because people can refresh their mind by changing a type of work.
8.0	For instance, there are many principles' work which they should do when students do the homework.
8.0	When I was tired of math assigntment, I can do the English's homework, at this time the English's assinment is new to us, and I will not consider that it is boring and it cna keep my interest to do the assignment.
8.0	Finally I finish my tasks without being tired.
4.0	Additionally, it is benneficial for us to do different types of work because it can extend our working ability.
8.0	My friend is a architect, and he think his job is really boring and can not devlope his capacity of working.
8.0	However he alterred his way of working, it is changed a lot .
8.0	When he is at work, he design some structure of buildings first, and then he will to visit some famous buildings to learn from it.
8.0	He successfully combines the parctical use with the knowledge, and his ability is developed  a  lot.
4.0	Whereas, working all day long to do simialar tasks have benefit that individuals can be focus on just one kind of work, and it can make us work efficiently.
9.0	However, the efficient work is not timeless because human may soom get tired of the work they are handlling with and lose the patience rapidly, and the quality of the assignment can not be promised.
9.0	Working like this will cause a series of nagtive influence.
1.0	To summarized, it wil has many merits to have many kinds of assignment to do in a workday.
1.0	People not only can efficiently  and enduringly, but also boost people's capacity to work.
3.0	Everything seems to become more complex due to the rapid development of the society.
3.0	For young people, there are large quantities of abilities to learn due to their social position.
12.0	They are the main workforece of the society, the strategy makers and practicers.
11.0	Among the abilities the ability to plan and organize is the essential, which is supported by most people.
11.0	In my view, I agree with it because the ability indeed brings benefits to young people.
4.0	To start with, young people are taking the responsiblity to make decisions and support the family.
8.0	They often have children to raise and parents to care.
8.0	Normal people are not likely to be very wealthy so that the ability to plan and organize shows its significance.
8.0	Be it house and vehicle, entertainment, tools or daily products, they all need to deliberate and allocate money legitimately.
4.0	Besides, time also need to be well planned and organized.
8.0	Young people usually have a lot of goals that they desire to achieve.
8.0	But the time is limited, in which case they should learn to make a full use of time.
8.0	Some young people pursue the accomplishments on academy for they are taking advanced education in colleges or universities, so they need to have a clear understand about what to learn and how to learn efficiently.
8.0	As to those young people working in companies, they try to gain a promotion or raise of salary.
8.0	Hence they should plan and organize their time to do more assignments reasonably.
4.0	Last, the society demands more leaders and elites to guide and administrate.
8.0	In a company, the leader always ought to make the right choice that can help the company get more profits.
8.0	But it is not easy to have every subordinates listening to the leader.
8.0	He must have good insight and respect from others, knowing the strategy clearly.
8.0	Also  he always have to convince others using his credence or other factors.
8.0	These are all based on the ability to plan and organize.
0.0	In brief, I affirm that it is essential for young people to have the ability to plan and organize.
0.0	This ability is not just referred to the capability to allocate time.
0.0	It is more about time, money and administration.
0.0	If a young person acquire the ability, he will find himself more relaxed when dealing with troublesome problems.
3.0	Nowadays, parents attach increasing importance to their childeren' s mark got in school.
3.0	Some parents even give kids money as reward when they get high grades.
11.0	In my opinion, taking following points into consideration, it is wise for parents to offer their school-age kids money for each high mark they get.
4.0	It is true that giving kids money for high grades may emphasize the importance of tests and grades too much, which may add burden to them.
9.0	However, children are supposed to get usde to stress and learn how to deal with it.
9.0	Therefore, having a bit stress actually does good to chileren, making them stronger.
4.0	On the one hand, giving kids money for high grades they get can encourage them to study harder and form a better command of knowledge.
9.0	In order to improve their grades and get more money, kids are likely to make more effect to ackquire more knowledge and seek for better ways to utilize knowledge they learn.
9.0	By doing this ,kids' learning ability can be trained.
4.0	On the other hand, giving kids money for high grades can cultivate their outlook on money.
10.0	Kids gain money by studying hard, which makes them realize that only bu making sustain efforts can one get rewards.
10.0	In conclusion, it is a good idea t
11.0	I agree with this statement.
12.0	In the past, young people didn't know to much things about the world , they tought their parents knew more than them, so they depended too much on their parents.
8.0	For example, my father used to study well, that because my grandparents were very srtick to him, when he was a students, a large part of his life is studing.
8.0	But when he got a chance to study in a very famous school, my grandparents refused to let him keep on studing.
8.0	They let him to work for money.
8.0	He agree with that, because he depended on his parents a lot, so that he can made his own decision.
8.0	When he grow up, he found that is not very good for his life by working for money when he was young.
8.0	Because, the grade is really usefull to get a job.
8.0	So he regret that he choosed to choose work when he was young.
6.0	But now, young people know lots of things, even know more than their parents, so they are able to make their own decision.
8.0	For example, when I was in primary school, my parent let me to learn to play badminton, I played that for three years, I got some successes on that, but I did never got the champion.
8.0	Then I lost interesting in playing badminton, I wanted to give it up.
8.0	I told my idea to my parents, but they didn't agree with me at first, but they decided to make my own decision.
8.0	Then I choosed to play the soccer, and I got the champion, my parents were very proud for me.
8.0	And they thought I got a right decision.
10.0	For these examples, I agree this statement, because today's young people know more things, they are cleared about what they need, so, they are able to make their own decisions.
3.0	There are so many kinds of advertisements in our daily life, and we cannot escape from them.
3.0	A few days ago,  my classmate complained to me how the jacket that he bought is different what they see in the TV.
3.0	And they product was not as soft as they said.
11.0	Indeed, the products in advertisements looks like they are better than they relly are.
5.0	First, the product seems to tell the audience how good experience the product can provide to the customers.
8.0	For example, an advertisement on car will keep telling the audience how big the room in the car is.
8.0	"You may see the driver takes many persons and then he will say"" plenty of room for family, plenty of room for friend"" and at forth, which will make you create a feeling that the room in the car is big enough to mmet their needs."
8.0	But in fact, the room in this car is just like some other formal cars.
8.0	It's not that much.
5.0	Secondary, the advertisements always invite some celebrities to advertise for their products.
8.0	"For instance, still the car, if there is a car racer with a lot of fame existing in the advertisement and then saying to you ""I like my car's fast"", it is of hogh possibility that you believe that the vechial is so great that it can offer the speed that you want."
8.0	On the countrary, the motor of the vechial may be as the same as some cars that cannot be more normal.
8.0	But what the advertisement companies do？
8.0	They just invite a celebrity that you like, then you believe that the car can be fast because the car racer says it's fast.
8.0	That is so radiculous.
0.0	Lastly, some companies are expecting to expose the advantages of their products to the audience, which can make the  mistake.
0.0	Take the hamburger in KFC for example, when you walk by the KFC, you always see a huge photo to show the passengers that there is a new kind of hamburger and come to have a taste.
0.0	But the size of the hamburger is be displayed in a such a big size that we even cannot figure how big the hamburger is in reality.
0.0	And we will easily believe the size of the burger is big enough to make us not hungery any more.
0.0	But after you eat the burger, you are still hungery.
3.0	In this day and age, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among students: people will prepare food more quickly after 20 years.
3.0	Opinion, vary from person to person.
3.0	Some claim that nowadays people cook very quickly, because they are very skilled.
11.0	However, contrary to their view comes my perspective that cooking will be faster in the future.
11.0	My point can be elaborated as follows.
6.0	First of all, cooking will be faster in the future, it is because the development of technology will make people's life more convieniment.
8.0	To be more specific, in the future, mechanical production may repalce human work, because the practice is also a dangerous thing, and people may hurt themselves.
8.0	Therefore, the machine replaces human practice, which is faster and safer.
8.0	For example, there is a restaurant selling fish, because the chef often uses knife to cook, so many chefs will accidentally hurt themselves, So the boss got a solution to solve this problem, they use machines to kill fish and cook food, which is both quick and safe.
1.0	Secondly, constantly updated and skilled, so people will be more skilled at handing ingredients after 20 years.
1.0	To be more specific, human are very intelligent, so they will learn from previous experience, process food more effectively, and maximize the value of food.
7.0	For example, there is a com
12.0	With the developing of the economy, people are become more and more addicted to the money, like everyone has his or her oppion to the work linked to the money, the judgement to the good or bad is only about the money.
12.0	The whole socielty only cares about the money.
4.0	Admittedly, we can not live without the money, however, school-age kids should not always cares about the money.
8.0	For instant, once in a exam, school-age kids get good grade, should school-age kids go to ask my parents for the money as a gift to buy something they want.
8.0	In my eyes, this is abselotelly wrong.
8.0	Firstly school-age kids study for us to get good grade for our future to have a method to live, school-age kids should not link the grade with the money.
8.0	If we do so, the school-age kids would likely lose their mind, only pursuit their marks for more and more money, therefore they would never understand the true meaning of study.
4.0	Secondly, if the parents provide the money as a gift when kids get good marks, consequently the children would likely to compare the amount of money with their friends and studymates; therefore, this would increase the parents' pressure on the funds.
10.0	Every parents are working hard to support the family, and kids should consider the difficulties if their parents, so in my oppion, school-age kids should not asking their parents for money when get good grade.
4.0	Finally, if school-age kids compare with each other on the money , the well study envirement would no longer be kept.
7.0	And if the students get bad great would
11.0	Nowadays, people are loving to talk about things in univerties, and there is a opinion that sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support becoming fairly popular.
12.0	I believe most people would like to support the financial support of sports and social activities should be equal as classes, which could enable students to gain relationship and health.
5.0	Few things could be more terrible than doing no sports or social activities in college life, because we can become healthy and gain happiness if we do sports during the totally tedious studying classes.
8.0	In the college life, things are always mroe complicated than what we think: classes and endless homework could make us despair and unsustainable.
8.0	We must find ways to release and encourage ourselves, so we can do sports and attend some social activities to solve those problems.
8.0	Can you imagine what will happen to a student if he just keep studying in his dorm with bunch of task papers for the whole night?
8.0	Have you ever thought about what damage will be brought to students if they keep their stay-up-late life for one week, one month, or even one year?
8.0	They must need to do some sports or attend some social activities like keeping the sanitation of streets to get rid of this kiind of high-pressure life.
8.0	Above these, college has no reason to refuse to pay equal financial aid between sports and classes.
5.0	Moreover, doing sports and attending social activities in college could help students get to know more students, and they all can be friends.
8.0	Such a new way of making new friends could not be cooler.
8.0	This is because for some first year students, most of them must be shy to get to know new people at the begining of the semester, so attending social activities of college  is just a awesome opportunity for them to make new bondships.
8.0	There are a lot of benefits if they can know many people in university, just like if a first year student doesn't know how the time of university hall room works, he can just find a sophomore friend to get the information, and they can also share knowledges during studying.
2.0	Thus, for the sake of the health and bondship of college students, universities should put sports and social activities qual finance as
3.0	Some people in society think that people think that is a good idea.
12.0	However, I have a different idea.
12.0	When it comes to statement that i think that is not a good idea, I strongly agree.
12.0	There are some reasons why I feel this way: thansfer the purpose of learning and antipathy to learning.
6.0	First of all, If children study for a certain dress, he becomes different of purpose for study.
7.0	It may be effective in a short time to improve their grade, but once you get it, children will be
3.0	Giving young students money as a reward of their acedemic achievements has a crusially negative impact on both their values and lives.
3.0	As children are given money for high grade, they started to perceive assessment marks as a method of gaining wealth.
12.0	This makes the motivation of studying unpure and lead to an over-valuing of the final result and money.
5.0	Nowadays people value wealth more and more that parents give money as a gift to their children for their good marks in tests.
8.0	This negatively influenced young people that they are given an idea of all effort can be rewarded by money therefore they generally value and treasre wealth more highly than ever before.
8.0	By doing this, adults gave a over-top preception of money and manipulated childrens view and common sense.
8.0	In the mordern world where more and more people saw money as their life persue, giving money to children as a reward of good mark is apparently mentally toxic.
5.0	On the other hand, grades are only an assessment of students' ability of answering test papers, and it does not reflect the wholistic success of children as a person.
9.0	By awarding them with money, parents built a destructive link between money and education and negatively changed the motivation of students.
9.0	This lead to an appalling fact that more and more young people focused only on the final facts but not the methods nor the processes which are supposed to be the most significant part of education.
2.0	Thus, the association of money and high grade is destructive for young students' common sense and mental health.
3.0	In nowadays' society, an increasing number of parents prefer to give their children money as a reward for their high grade at school.
12.0	From my point of view, it doesn't sound s good idea because it will make their children miss the purpose of study and their children may not have the ability to manage money on their own.
4.0	First of all, it's likely to mislead their children about the main purpose of study.
8.0	Children are supposed to know that study is not for others, it's for themselves to own a better future.
8.0	I have a friend who alwaya gives her child reward for their good grades at school, at first the child studied really hard, which really satistied my friend, But after some times, when she stopped giving rewards to the child, the child resisted because he thought it was his right to get rewared for studying hard, so he lost the passion of study and his grades decreased.
8.0	This indicades that parents should educate their children what's the purpose of study instead of just giving them rewardes.
4.0	Moreover,  In other words, if parents give children money as a reward, they don't know how to spend it because they have lack of facial experience.
9.0	My brother received a large amount of money as a reward from my parents recently, a month ago it was all gone because my brother spent all of them on computer games.
9.0	This suggests that children are can't spend their money in the right way.
4.0	Finally, although giving children money as a reward provides a good chance to teach their children how to spend their money effectively, but there are other ways to replace it such as let them intership at a store or communicate with them face to face.
10.0	These ways are more effective and can avoid the waste of money.
2.0	In conclusion, children shoouldn't receive money as a reward for their good grades because it will mislead their children about the purpose of study and young children don't konw how to manage their money well.
11.0	I think this is a good a idea.
11.0	I think that problem of education been such salient than today in the history.
11.0	The eduction is very important for people.
12.0	Parents are likely to create some new method to encourager their children to become a more passionate about study.
12.0	And they can make many friends.
12.0	Do you agree?
6.0	Chlidren need teachers and children, because they need study and conmmunictae.
8.0	But parents haven't enough time to teach children.
8.0	They have to go work every day.
8.0	If they didn't go work, they couldn't have enough money to afford live cost.
8.0	So children need to go to school when they get school-age.
2.0	Then school's teachers have enough knowledge and experence.
10.0	And they have studied major class.
7.0	To sum up, parents shoud offer their school-age childre moe
3.0	Nowaday, some parents give thier children money when they get a high mark in school.
11.0	In my opinions, it is a good idea to pray children by this way.
11.0	I will explain my opinion by two reasons.
4.0	In fact, encouging children to get high mark by giving them money can give more power to learn than those praise way to like some words, going out to play.
8.0	With money, children can buy what they want, and it is a sense of fulfilled that make children to chaise for.
8.0	With this willing, they will make greater efforts to learn.
8.0	And as a result, they will get another high score at next exam.
8.0	I have a sister called Jane who is studying in a primary school.
8.0	She can sometimes get a high score but can't never get high scores for the whole term.
8.0	This semister my parents tried to pray her by money after they read an article about how to give power to children.
8.0	Jane did well in this semister and she said that she could get new toys by studying hard.
8.0	We are all looking forward to her final exam.
4.0	Whatmore, encouraging children by money can help them build a sense of pay.
8.0	In chiledhood they study hard and get 'paid',  and they know that 'no pay,no gains'.
8.0	In the future when they have to work, these memory can help them become a nice worker.
8.0	And even they want to be bosses, they can still learn from this and avoid some failures in the society.
8.0	For example, my classmate Jack, who have earned one hundred thousand dollars by himself during the college life, for that while he was a kid, his father gave him fifty cents to buy ticks after a high grade and learned to earned money by hard work.
4.0	Whereas, someone claims that it may make children feel lonely when parents just give money but not company and educate their children.
9.0	I think it won't be a problem for that if a parents doesn't care his children, the way of how to pray this high grade is not in his consideration.
9.0	So, money is not the case, when the parents are.
2.0	All in all, offering money for each high grade is a good idea for the reason that it can give children more power to learn and help learn to work hard to get paid.
12.0	i don;t think that is a good idea.
8.0	i am indepentence because my parents are really nice to me. they let me to solve about promblems by myself and woudn't help me when i can figue out by myself.
8.0	I always try to keep my own ideas and make my own choice.
8.0	I could not go to the high school that i really want last year.
8.0	however, i didn't regret or upset at all.
8.0	I knew what i have tried already before the final.
8.0	I get up at 5 and i study until 1 or even 2 a.m.
8.0	I study harder than others and i have alrealdy try my best.
8.0	whatever grades I got.
8.0	that grade cannot improve anything but my try hard can be.
8.0	So I don't care to offer extra money for better school.
8.0	In my opion, that is not neccessary at all.
8.0	Nowadays, more and more parents try to offfer their children money for each high grade they get in school.
8.0	To be honest, that happens around me. including my classmate, my family and friends of my mom.
8.0	I have to say study in American as the exchange students is possibly the same thing.
8.0	However, I always independent and make my own choice.
8.0	I just dare to fly to other countries to experience myself.
8.0	I think that is fasnating and signnify to travel all over the world.
8.0	My classemate said my parents pay a lot of money to improve me a better environment.
8.0	I do think so fortunately i am, but i just want to see th word.
8.0	it is different between offermoney to school because i just try to choice what kind of lifestyle i want but not pay for a better school.
8.0	Parents don't even know we live it or not, so how can they
11.0	I agree this point because this can make them grow fast .
12.0	Children are ofe scolded by their parents when they make mistakes .
11.0	however i do believe parents should sometimes allow children to make and learn from theirown mistakes .
8.0	What children learn from their mistakes is likely to be impressive to them.
8.0	Mistakes can serve as valuable lesssons ,when children experience the consquence of their mistakes ,they will realize how their poor decision or actions will lead to unpleasant things .
8.0	Compared with the advice and instructions of parents,such as experiences are more likely to leave a lasting impression on children.
8.0	Consequently ,they will learn to take a second thought in order not to make the same mistakes ,if they face the same situation again.
6.0	I think parents should allow thire children to make and learn from their mistakes as it can prove to be lessons more impressive an dis beneficialto psychological health of the children.
1.0	When children grow up ,their  can have a good ablilty which face to the problems  or mistakes before.
1.0	This can make their life way more easily.
12.0	We all always say that the gateway to maintain relationship between people is to increase your credit and always be honorable to people, just like always telling truth without any cheating.
11.0	But in some times, telling the truth is not a good way to deal with some things and that can even lead to a pessimistic consequence.
6.0	There is a famous story that all of us must have been heard many times in our childhood is that 'The boy who cried wolf'.
8.0	The general plot of the story goes like there was a boy who lived on feeding sheep in a village.
8.0	And the village had a lot of wolves that were always harmful to sheep and children.
8.0	One day, the boy felt bored and he just want to joke around with villgaers and he screamed: 'The wolves are coming', the seconds later all the villagers came to the boy with weapons and saw no wolves, but a boy who cannot stop laughing, then the villagers left.
8.0	And another day, the boy really saw wolves and he creamed with crying again.
8.0	No answer and nobody came around.
8.0	Few days later, someone in the village found the corses of the boy and sheep.
8.0	This story just tells us the significance of telling the truth, even though they are villagers who has not much relationship with you.
2.0	However, telling truth cannot go a long way in some special circumstances, even we need to be lying sometime.
8.0	Few years ago, there was a senior high school studying in a city which was far away from his own hometown, and he knowed nobody around him, so he thought he should study hard and devote all of him into studying to change his family's life and doesn't let his father down.
8.0	When the college entering test was coming, his fater died in his hometown, and all the family and his villagers lied to him that his father was doing good, and everything at home was just fine when the young adolescent called his home.
8.0	At last, the student reached a high score in the test, then he knowed the death of his papa.
8.0	As a result this is a fairly moving story  because all people lied to him, and we call this a 'kind lie‘.
12.0	With the development of the economic and the sociaty, just have a good acdamic ability is not enough we also should have the social ability and learn how to use them in the future work or life.
11.0	A healthy body also is a very important wealth in our life.
11.0	So for these opinion that the sports and the social ability are just as important as classes and libraries I fully argee.
5.0	In the class the professor instruct us a lot useful information and we soak them to meet some exams or some experiments.
8.0	The time of the class is very limited so the professor can not talk about all of the details.
8.0	He could only tell you the most important knowladge and the king procedures of a experiment.
8.0	As a result of that, a lot of imformations that are important to your major should be attained from the library.
8.0	We go to the library and find some books to study our major deeply.
8.0	By this way we will find that we also have a lot of question and the professor just tell us a very small part.
8.0	Then you will have problem to ask the professor and claim your own opinion about these projects.
8.0	So you will gain the knowledge that you actually need.
8.0	Not only that, this way that study by yourself at the library also cultivate the ability that think by ourselves and criticize thinking.
8.0	If we want to have big achievement in our own major these ability is necessary.
8.0	So the libraries are so important in our university life.
5.0	The social ability  teach us how to use the things we study in the university to help the development of the sociaty.
8.0	For example we study the market in the business department.
8.0	We learn how to analize the idea of the consumer and how to appeal them to buy our products.
8.0	But if we can not use them in the work, these theoretical knowledge will be useful.
7.0	That why when the
3.0	With the rapid development of economy and society, high-tech is playing a vital role in people's life.
12.0	It is quite common for children to play computer games after school.
12.0	However, whether children should be allowed to play computer games has become a hot topic.
12.0	some people holds the opinion that playing computer games is a waste of time so children should be banned to play computer games.
12.0	Frankly speaking, I agree with this statement for teh following reasons;
6.0	First of all, computer games is quite attractive for young children, once a chid is allowed to play computer games, it is quite easy for him to be addicted to it, then he will not concentrate on his study, insted he will spend most of his time to play computer games and eventually he would get nothing but become the slave of computer games.
8.0	Taking one of my students as an example, she is a 17-year-old girl who is intelligent and talented in english.
8.0	She wants to go abroad for further study so her mother sent her to our school to learn IELTS.
8.0	Everytime i came to check out her homework, I found her focusing on her ipad whose screen displays a computer game.
8.0	I have told her many times to play computer games after finishing the homework, she did not listen to me but continued to her games.
8.0	As a result, after she participated in the IELTS exam, she did not get her ideal score.
8.0	As you can see, since she was so immersed in playing computer games, she wasted a lot of precious time and finnally got punished by receiving an upset result.
3.0	Friends plays the most part in our life and study, so they arevery crucial to us.
11.0	As far as I'm concerned, it will be better to maintaina long and strong friendship with a small number people than to always make new friends.
12.0	It is not only because we have got along with them longer so that they understand us more, but also the friendship with them has no impurities.
12.0	Besides, many new friends will make us spend less time on our own things.
5.0	First, we have experienced more things with the previous friends, so they know us well.
8.0	My own experience will never fail to explain this.
8.0	When I entered my university first, I made a wealth of new friends because I think the frienship is very important in my life.
8.0	But every time I have hard time in facing a task in class or contest in my department, I will still call my previous friends, because they know more about me and they can make me happy.
8.0	They can tell us how to refresh myself since I usually asked them when having exams or contest in high school and they can also comfort me as they always did.
8.0	But the new friends in the university, they will take less care of my condition or even did not pay any attention on it since they did not know how to help me and enhance my confidence.
8.0	So I always have some unhappy experience with my new friends.
5.0	Second, as we grow older, the friendship between us and previous friends will become more and moer pure.
8.0	Take Steve for an instance.
8.0	He had a great friend since he was small.
8.0	And after he want university, he met Bill Gates and they became friends.
8.0	And they both established their own companies, which went retty well.
8.0	But  Jobs always felt the friendship had altered and become more commerical.
8.0	He could not just walk along the streeets with Gates and talked about the computer they liked.
8.0	When they met each other, the topic was often how to collabtate and make more profit, so their fiendship had more purities, while Jobs' previous friends always visited him and asked about his difficult experience in his life or commerence.
8.0	He was always happy when talking about the interest he had in their childhood because their friendship was not affected by the money or company service.
8.0	They were just friends and their friendship wa pure and no impurities.
0.0	Last, admittedly, making new friends provided us more opportunities to know new people, but in fact we have less time to spend surely on friendship, which will make us unhapppy.
0.0	For example, we need to always meet and talk with differnet people to make some new friends, but then can not we truly spend some time with our friends to build and streghten the friendship.
0.0	Then this kind of friendship can not last long.
0.0	So why do not we jst spend more time with our previous friends and have the true friendship with them and enjoyed the happiness the friendship offer to us.
3.0	Nowadays,in order to encourage children to get high grade,some parents offer their school-age children money for good grade they get in school.
11.0	In my opinion,this is not a good idea,although my parents used to make deals with me like this.
12.0	Here are my reasons.
5.0	First,too much money is not good for school-age children.
8.0	School-age children are too young to have clear money concept.
8.0	For example,if a student get some money from his parents,he may not have an idea on how to use it.
8.0	At this time,some of his classmates may offer him some bad items.
8.0	Lacking judgement,he may go on a bad way against study,such as playing games,having drugs,etc.
5.0	Next,such behavior may cause him to think that study is just in order to make money.
8.0	If a student believe that study is just a tool to get money,he may not interested in study any more,and he will become unwilling to study.
8.0	As you know,study is an interesting prosess that a person get to know knowledge.
8.0	If you don't like study and just are forced to study,when facing a tough task,you are very likely to give up.
8.0	But to those who love study,tough task is a chance to prove his ability and gain an achievement and feel proud.
2.0	As for me, I don't like the idea that parents offer money to school-age children for high grade.
7.0	Me myself once made a deal with my parents that if I get the first three in the final test in middle school,they would buy me a compute
3.0	Recently, lots of people in the society support the utility of working with others and function as a group.
3.0	Thus, many teachers assign projects that ask students to work with their peers for learning effectiveness.
11.0	Many people believe it's a brilliant idea, but personally, I don't think working together is actually that great.
12.0	Students should work on the projects alone so that they can study in the most effective way.
5.0	To begin with, students work on the projects alone can  learn what they are really interested in to study.
8.0	In the group projects, the topic should be agreed by most of the members.
8.0	Therefore, in many cases, some students cannot choose what they really want to learn to study on and their study effectiveness is reduced by this reason.
8.0	Conversely, if all students can work on what they are really curious about as their individual group topic, their study effectiveness would be maximized.
8.0	For instance, I was in a chemistry projectr with other two classmates.
8.0	They wanted to do an experiment about burning sugars while I am pretty curious about burning different sorts of metals and plus I already knew what will happen if sugars are burnt, so in this group project I didn't learn anything new at all but wasted lot of time.
5.0	Secondly, students that work with others on the projects might rely on the group members instead of learning hard.
8.0	Free rides heppen all the times in the group projects.
8.0	Some students don't actually study very much or do contribution to the projects as much as they can.
8.0	In this situation, their learning effectiveness is really limited due to sharing responsibility with others.
8.0	Assume that everybody works alone for themselves, everyone is responsible for their own project and they will put much efforts on it therefore their learning effecitveness is maximized.
2.0	To put into a nutshell, students should work on the projects alone for their learning effectiveness because they can focus on what they are really insterested to do and can only rely on themselves instead of seeking others help.
3.0	Can the large number of the things bring the imbroglio?
3.0	Do the various type of works reduce our working efficiency?
3.0	As a common university student, I do not like the learning of various type of subjects.
11.0	Actually, from my perspective, since we deal with large number of things, we can not do many things well.
10.0	For the distraction and the lower working efficiency.
6.0	On the one hand, the large number of things render us too busy to do one thing extraodinarily .
8.0	To be more convincible, there is a apothegm called one should not persue two things at the same time in my country, which means that we can not do one things well if there are others distract us.
8.0	There is no better illustration than the instance of myself, a common university student who have large quantity of the assignments to finish everyday.
8.0	As a result, the time that distributing to every courses is very little, and the energy that we put in every course is little.
8.0	Obviously, we will have fewer distributions of any subject, so we can not gain the same result as good as the result we focus on a specific course.
8.0	So we can not do one thing well as the large number of the thing we should do.
0.0	On the other hand, the large number of things reduce our working efficiency.
0.0	To be more specific, we will feel tired when we deal with lots of assignments, since the various types of these works seem miscellaneous and render us distracted.
0.0	While we feel distrated, we do not want to do any more.
12.0	In my opinion.
12.0	I agree with the statement that parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.
8.0	And here are the reasons.
8.0	First,I think everybody can't be perfect.
8.0	The adults often make mistakes,so the children can't be the exception.
8.0	Second every successful bussiness is getting from several failed trying.
8.0	For example.
8.0	Edison is the king of designing new things.
8.0	Such as the light and the electricity using.
8.0	But behind the huge achievments.
8.0	Are the thousands of failed trying.
8.0	So if the parents want the children be successful when they grow up.
8.0	They should let the children make mistakes.
8.0	Third,making thire own mistakes is benefit for their growing.
8.0	Some time,maybe we can solve some problems in a wrong way luckily.
8.0	If we never failed on this bussiness，we will use the wrong way to solve similar problems.
8.0	For example.
8.0	In the last century,there was a kind of plane.
8.0	It was making the longest safely flying record.
8.0	So every people thought it is a
3.0	The is a growing tendency for big companies to get their employees involved in different kinds of tasks, opinions on which are divided.
12.0	I beleive workers are usually more satisfied when they are in charge of differentiated assignments during the workday than do similar tasks all day long.
5.0	Workers occupied with different tasks all day long are easy to get a sense of achievement, either form the complexity of work but also from the variety.
8.0	Doing different tasks in a day is to some extent beneficial to our health and brains, since we are fully occupied and chaning another assignmeng means to change our brains and our ways of thinking in a short time.
8.0	It is also regarded as a way of relaxing and rest to change another task by some successful people.
8.0	People tend to get a sence of achievement at the end of the day when looking back what they have done for a whole day,which  sometimes be physical and mental demanding.
8.0	Solving different problems one by one in a day is quick to draw our full attention, creating a concentrated atomsephere inside and improve work efficiency at a large scale.
5.0	Spending all day long doing similar work is a contributor to  low efficient work.
9.0	If people continue doing the same work, it is  difficult to arouse interest,and the work will become increasingly boring and nonattractive, therefore  leading to low spirit.
9.0	Sometimes, employees may even get mental disease, for the reason that people are doing what a robot can do ,and are consistently afraid that they might be replaced by robots and machines oneday, making nerves stressed all the time.
2.0	To conclude, it is of great significance for workers to get involved in different tasks , but one thing can not be denied is that the variety and workload should be limited within one's ability.
10.0	thus we can make sure that workers are usually more satisfied when they are in charge of differentiated assignments during the workday than do similar tasks all day long.
3.0	Nowadays people gradually realize the importance of the relaxation, we tend to relax ourselves after long stressful work.
3.0	Some prefer to relax by working out.
12.0	I, however, believed that watching a movie or reading a book is no doubt a better way to relax.
4.0	First of all, for most of us, it is our minds that are really stressed out.
8.0	By enjoying a classic movie or a favorite novel, we can easily forget all the pressure on us by filling our head with the appealing plots.
8.0	For example, I love to watch comedy after a weeks' tidy works.
8.0	As long as I saw the those movies, there would be smile on my face.
8.0	Conversely, doing exercises may make our bodies exhauseted.
4.0	Moreover, activities like reading a novel can be done in everywhere and in everytime.
8.0	E-books and smartphones give us the access to movie and books when we are on subway or in canteen.
8.0	It's very convienient for us to make full use of those seperated time to relax in this way.
8.0	On contrary, doing exercise seems not appropriate in most situation.
8.0	It requires large space, big instruments and even some companions.
8.0	Besides, after doing it, it's hard for you to go back to work immediately without taking a shower.
4.0	At last, doing sports are not suitable for all of us.
8.0	Some exercises activities like american football, basketball and swimming require good body conditions.
8.0	For some disable or sick people, it's impossible for them to relax in these way.
8.0	In addition, some sports are also very competetive, which may provoke conflicts between those hot- head people.
8.0	However, reading a book and watching a movie really suits almost all of us.
2.0	The conclusion can be easily made that watching a movie or doing some reading has more advantages than doing exercises as a way of being relaxed, since its' mental relieving function, accessability and fiting for everybody.
11.0	I do agree with the statement that in twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.
4.0	First, with the development of technology, public transportation, high-speed and more safe,  will be boost in a short period.
8.0	On the one hand, going everywhere like travelling, going abroad by public transportation will save you a lot of money and control the gross costs in somehow.
8.0	As you all know, public transportation is much cheaper and saves the fees of money-consuming oil which will be more and more expensive as a result of its scarcety.
8.0	On the other hand, it will save you a lot of your precious time by avoiding much traffic jams and secure your security with less time.
8.0	You don't have to be let down by the traffic jams and don't have to be fined for being late for work.
8.0	And you don't have to spend time in finding a suitable parking lot where you can park your cars.
8.0	You can imagin how you will be quite relaxed without driving a car when in a long-distance travelling by taking public transportation.
4.0	Second, the awareness of protecting the environment is improved and enhanced for the environment deteriorating by excessive emisson of car wastes.
9.0	More and more people have been aware of the importance of protecting environment by decreasing the use of private cars.
9.0	Besides, the publicity of diminishing car wastes emission is conducted by government and other social associations.
4.0	Third, for the presseure of deteriorating environment, government will take measures to control the environmental pollution such as car wastes emission and improve the quality of environment gradually.
10.0	For example, the government curbs the deteriorating trend of environment by putting up the price of cars or increasing the tax of buying a car and etc.
2.0	To put it in a nutshell, in twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today for the improving awareness of protecting environment, saving money and time, and controlling with economical means by governments.
3.0	Nowadays there have an extremly debate on whether school should spend more money on professores salaries.
3.0	Some people content that it's an efficient way to  enhance the universuty acdemac level but others hold the view that professors have got high salaries and school should spent more money on  other areas to improve the school.
12.0	As fa as I'm concerned, improve the salaries of the university is neccessity.
5.0	Firstly, paying more to the university teachers is the most  directly way that the professors can satisfied with their salaries which contributes they concentratd on their teaching rather than think about write books and take leacture to earn extra money.
5.0	In addition to this, with optiamal salaries paid for professors,more excellent person will willing to come to the universities and take the job as a professos.
8.0	Then there have  intereact profit in both school and this excellet people.
8.0	To be an professor can have higher salaries and win reputation,and the universities  can enhance general acdamic level with more elites.
8.0	In another word, if an university want to  develope itself , it's undoubtly that they need to concern with the professors  salaries.
7.0	Thouh
7.0	the if universities want to improve the quality of education have other way to do, but enhace the
3.0	When you go shopping with your intimate on the street, there is a child crying on the floor alone frustratedly, would you comfort the child and help him find the way home?
3.0	When you come across an old man who is blind, would you give a hand to him and help him across the road.
11.0	According to a survey form NanChang University, 80 percentage of students give the answer that they are willing to others even who they are unfamiliar.
11.0	Therefore, I have a profound conviction that the young peopel today have significant influence on the important decisions because that their daily behavior can make a favourable effect to the society.
4.0	First of all, young people in the modern life pay more attention on the society, leading they spend more energy and time to make the world better.
8.0	For instance, many university students in my neiborboud participate in the social canpaign called Helping.
8.0	The orgainzation is held by the monitor of one classroom, and she always invinte many young students to contribute their unnecessary items to the community in order to help that poor family if they need them.
8.0	Thanks to the commual campaign, many family that live in dilemma can have a opportunity to gain some important things or tools free.
4.0	On top of that, with the development of technique, there are more approaches for young people to deal with problems quickly and effiectively and rebuild the society.
9.0	To illustrate, in the last, as a result of the limitation of communiation and transportation, in many cirstamstance, people could not go to the definite place to help the refugee when the earthquake happened unfortunately.
9.0	However, in the modern life, individuals can take the airplane and transport a lost of really important goods to the shelters.
4.0	Adimittedly, it is true that young people today are extremely busy with their work, so they have no enough time to participate in the social activies.
10.0	Nevertheless, the essence of their hastle work is to make our life and our society better because the development of the whole society depend on the all walks of people and they have to work in oder to satisfy the need of society.
7.0	To put all into a nutshell, I strongly believe that young people have much inflence on the society because they can rebuild the soety and
3.0	Have you ever seen the violent plots of some movies?
3.0	Have you ever felt distracted after watching television?
11.0	From a common student in our local university, television has more bad influences than the positive effects in my life, since the television is a distraction and some bad plots in the movies is unfavorable for our behaviors.
5.0	On the one hand, television decreases our working efficiency.
8.0	To be more convincible, the television is able to enrich our leisures as an entertainment way for its character of pastime.
8.0	Contrarily, if we do it in the working day, we will distract from the television and will not have sufficient energy to finish our target everyday extraordinarily.
8.0	Consider myself for instance, I often watch the NBA games during my lunch time before, and I still thinks of some passing, shooting in the games on the afternoon working time.
8.0	Then I feel distracted and tired, so I can not finish my work everyday.
8.0	Obviously,  television decreases our working efficiency.
5.0	On the other hand, television enables us to come into having some bad behaviors.
8.0	To be more specific, there are large number of violent plots in the action movies, and the violent plots render us ablaze and enhance the probability of crimes.
8.0	There are no better illustration to prove this idea than the instance of my uncle Lee, which have been arrested for the fighting 4 years ago.
8.0	At that time, Lee had a addiction in the action movies of Bruce Lee, than every day he jumped up and down to immitated Bruce Lee and he felt ablaze.
7.0	One day he was drunk and fighted with a stranger when we have dinner outside,
3.0	In these days, many schools encourage students to make up their own clubs and to join some club activities.
3.0	They think these are great for students because these will provide students with socializing and out-class experience and it can also give students much fun in school.
3.0	Students also consider it as a really important activity and experince.
11.0	But I think it still can not compare to academoc studies for the benefit students can get.
5.0	First,maybe club activities can be formal,they are still a kind of entertainment.
8.0	Students consider the club activities as an out-class experince,so actually they will also consider these activities as a kind of entertainment and relaxment.
8.0	Image that,what kind of student would like to treat club activities seriously after a long day's study?
8.0	And Actually students still need to study hard.
8.0	Although they can organize it,they still have no time.
5.0	Second,academic studies are way more effective.
8.0	Club activities can be thought to be great experinces and will provide us self-improvement.
8.0	But the most important thing for a student is his grade and the students need to consider it as his main concerning.
8.0	Club activities can actually help us to get wider view and process.
8.0	But what about compare to academic studies?
8.0	Academic studies can more directly help the students and it is their own duty to learn things in class well.
0.0	Third,many club activities that students organized are actually not reliable.
0.0	Although their might be some students who have great leadership and are very intelligent,most of them have no experience organizing something and probably can not handle it well.
0.0	For example,when I am in school,some students set up a artifact club.
0.0	We all get very excited at first but then we actually have nothing more to do,because the leaders didn't plan to have any kind of activities,we just do what we want to do and we all have our studies to handle.
8.0	Finally,the club is dismissed.
8.0	So students probably are lack of skills of organizing and they still need to handle their studies.
8.0	That would possibly cause that the club activities are not helpful and reliable.
3.0	Happiness is always the center topic of people's life.
12.0	And some recent arguments says that becaus the world's changing quickly, people are less satisfied with the recent life and feel more enjoyable about the life in the past.
12.0	But we can take a look at the environmetn around us.
11.0	More gyms are being built, which permits people have place to train and release pressure.
11.0	More students are going abroad to study, which can enrich youngsters knowledge.
12.0	More advaned thecnology for entertainment are being researched, which allows people can refreash themselves.
5.0	First, nowadays more and more gyms appear in the city we live in, giving us a good opportunity to do sports and change the sedentary lifestyle.
8.0	My father always go to the gym after working to ensure his own health and release the pressure from work.
8.0	I always can see him running and doing some activities to train himself and also he can get some suggetsions from the coachs, which helps him a lot when worrying about whether his motions are correct.
8.0	Every time he talks to me about the health, he will talk about the happy life the younsters have since when he was at my age he even could not find some approaches to do sports.
8.0	He is very satisfied with the life nowadays and the it provide him with sufficient happiness he didn't obtain before.
5.0	Second, the education are also being improved and enhanced.
8.0	This point can be best illustrated by the example by the increasing number of youngstes who have been abroad for farther study.
8.0	We can know that more and more people are registering the TOEFL or other language tests for the demand of studying abroad, which was something that we could not even imagine during the past.
8.0	Studying at other countries are beneficial for the young people and they can expand their outlook and learn the most advanced technology to make better life for the next generation, such the computer knowledge.
8.0	The computer and mobile phone is everywhere around us and we use them almost every time of our daily life.
8.0	That is all the consequence of the advanced knowledge, which comes from the better technology which people in the past never had.
0.0	Last, people are having more methods to have fun than before.
0.0	For instance, now we can go outside with our friends to have much fun, such as watching movie or singing in the KTV and playing in the Disney parks.
0.0	We can totally enjoy ourselves in these activities because we can be absorded in them and forget any bad feeling in life or school or arguments with friends.
0.0	But in th past, people surely could not h
3.0	Many people would say that parents who have a little time should play with their kids because playing with children can enhance your relationship and make children like you more.
3.0	I agree that having fun with kids can leave a happy time.
3.0	After all, when I was young I usually play with my father, we played toy cars and table tennis together, which made me love to stay with my father more than my mom in childhood.
12.0	However, from my perspective today, I hold the view that parents should utilize their limited time on kids' schoolwork.
4.0	Adimittedly, maintaining a happy relationship with kids is very important.
9.0	Without a relaxing atmosphere, kids might have some mental problems during their growing period.
9.0	On the other hand, if parents cannot care these two aspects together, doing things related to schoolwork is more significent for the following reasons.
4.0	Parents are children's first teacher.
8.0	They should play an important role in kids' academic studying.
8.0	It is impossible for kids to study well only rely on school teaching, and parents' education might have a great propotion.
8.0	Take my brother as an example, his parents, my uncle and aunt, never care about his schoolwork.
8.0	They contend that teaching children is teacher's work so they did not follow teacher's guidence to help my brother's schoolwork.
8.0	As a result, my brother had to go abroad because of his low academic performance.
8.0	By contrast, my parents usually communicate with my teachers and ask me to do homework as well as do some prepare lesson before going to school.
8.0	It is lucky for me to gain great score with the help of parents and teachers.
4.0	Children can have more fun when they play with friends, so it is not necessary for parents to use time having fun with them.
10.0	It is difficult for parents to get what kids interest in, but the same age kids can do better.
1.0	In a word, if parents can do the both aspects, it is the best choice.
1.0	But with limited time, parents should focus on kids schoolwork more.
11.0	Without doubt, parents want their school-age children to be interested in studying, and get good grades.
12.0	Some of them choose to give kids some money as a praise.
11.0	It do encourage kids to study hard, however, I don't think this way is very wise for following reasons.
5.0	The purposes of studying and exams are changed by this way.
8.0	People study for themselves, and through the process, they can harvest happiness or know what they are good at thus buid self-confident.
8.0	Money shouldn't be the final purpose to study, this will make the kids misunderstand the reasons for study and lose their way.
8.0	The purpose of exams is to check if you master the knowledge you learned before, and help teacher to know your situation on study then adjust teaching methods.
8.0	Using money as a kind of praise make the exams become tasks for kids.
8.0	In  some extent, they may get some pressure from this way.
5.0	If a children don't understand the purpose of sudying or exams, and his parents use this way to encarage him, he may cheat in exams to achieve the goal.
8.0	The kid may just want to get the money instead of learning something, so he may ignore how much effort he should put to learn well, and find a easy way such as cheating to earn the money.
8.0	My cousin Jerry was not interested in studying, so my uncle promised him if he get good grades, he will give Jerry 100 yuan as a gift.
8.0	Jerry tried to work hard and get good grades, however, he failed.
8.0	So he desided to cheat in the exam, and get the money, but this made him failed badly in a serious exam.
8.0	He can't enter the university and my uncle regrets a lot about his method.
2.0	According to these reasons, I don't think parents should offer money to their children to encourage  them to study hard.
3.0	As soon as I see this topic, what I want to say is I disagree with this statement.
3.0	As the saying goes, life exists in exercise.
12.0	A good body is the premise of everything in our life.
12.0	On the contarary, whether how important the spirits' development is, if we only pay attention on it so that ignored the importance of exercises, we'll regret for it in the future.
11.0	So in my opinion, doing physical exercise is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.
6.0	Now I want to talk about some benifits of doing exercise.
8.0	Before I was 13 years old, my physical condition was always not very well.
8.0	I caught cold almost every month.
8.0	Everytime I caught a cold, my mother would be struggled with me because I need to go to the hospital to see the doctors and take many different kind of pills.
8.0	My parents were so nervous about me during those years.
8.0	When I entered the junior high school, my parents decided to send me to learn dancing.
8.0	I started my twice a week dancing life.
8.0	I was so enjoying when I was dancing.
8.0	It is not only very gorgeos for a girl, but also practice my  sometic function.
8.0	My physical codition was getting better and better during that period and I gain a awesome skill which can make my life more colorful and wonderful.
8.0	And another important function of dancing is that it is really a good way to relax myself.
8.0	When I  was dancing, I was absorbed in the music, the tempo and my dancing posture so that I can forget the troubles and tired on studying.
8.0	Fantastic, I should say.
1.0	But if you look at on my middle school life later, you would find out how terrible it is when I put my entire heart on my study.
1.0	My middle school is the greatest school in our city, the heavy pressure is common to us students.
8.0	When I was a grade 1 students, I had a lot of homework to do every day.
8.0	To saved my time and relied on the conveniont of the internet, I choose to wacth videos on the iPad when I want do relax myself.
8.0	This behaviour last till the start of my grade 2.
7.0	I found that my vision became more and more weak
7.0	and I always feel ache of my back
12.0	I agree with the statement that nowadays people are more willing to help the struggling stangers than before,especially for young peoples like us.
12.0	by young people working,studing,traveling through the world,without family or friends companied,it becomes a general trend for us to help each other,even strangers.
6.0	At first,people have more enough matierial conditions to express their benevolence .
8.0	with the high speed of society development,younger gennerration have more disposable income,in the sense ,they have the capability to help others when their friends encounter problems,or other government formal campaine which is established to support people who long for help.
8.0	Numeroud youngersters like to donate thier hardly earn money to those suffered from the pains of illness or partly subsizee the tuition fees ofthe Helping others is always comsidered as a sort of traditional virtue.
8.0	Young people recieved fine home education and formal education,both parents and educators will teach them how to behave well,make a clear distinction between right and wrong.
8.0	Take my young cousin for example,he always help mother carry the heavy bag everytime,after they bought vegetables from the fair,which is closely related to parents guidance and educatiuon.
11.0	Living in the era of informatin explosion, more and more young people are willing to change the society.
12.0	Thus, there is a hot topic which is whether yougn people today have the influence on the important decisions that determine the future of society as a whole.
11.0	Even though, some people are in favor of the idea that the youth today don't have any influence on the important decisions that determine the future of society as a whole, I believe in the opposite statement for the following reasons.
5.0	Firstly, young people today are full of imaginative and creative.
8.0	As we all know that, young people today play an important role in the modern society.
8.0	They have a lot of ideas about how to create a new things and they also can find out where the problem is and fix it up immediately.
8.0	For example, when I was 22 years old, I attended in a famous cell phone comnpany and I was the designer of the company.
8.0	However, I did't have the chance to design the phone because I was new in the company and I didn't have any experience before.
8.0	Thus, the company didn't let me to design the phone.
8.0	After several weeks, I found out that the cell phone which was designed by experienced designer was out of fashion about the looking and I gave them some suggestions because I thought it could make the phone's appearance cooler.
8.0	Thereby, there must be many people to buy it.
8.0	Finally, the result was good just like what I expected.
8.0	Therefore, young people today can build a lot of creatin and imaginatin.
5.0	Moreover, the young people in the modern society have their own thinking.
8.0	More and more young man are willing to show their thinking to the public.
8.0	Four years ago, I heard a news that the young man disagreed with the policy which the government just put it out.
8.0	And there were a group of young people standed in front of the government to show their anger.
8.0	After several weeks, the government canceled the policy with more critical thinking.
8.0	That policy seems like pretty undesirable to the society and I feel very happy because they made a good choice.
8.0	Thus, the young people in the society have their thinking and they also will show their thinking to the public.
2.0	All in all, I disagree with the statment because the young people today are creative and willing to show their own idea.
3.0	I think government spend money on public transportation is better than spend money on internet access.
3.0	I think when the urban road are not smooth, takeaway service will diapear in this city.
12.0	Although you can during internet access to entertainment, most of time you need to go outside to entertainment with your family or friends.
5.0	On the one hand, if the government spend a lot of money on internet access, and the public transportation will inconvenient for the people go outside to entertainment.
8.0	For example, when you want go to a birthday party, and your can't going the birthday party on time cause your urban public transportation was terrible.
8.0	So you can only see the birthday party situation by video calls with your friends.
8.0	That is first reason why i think the government spend money on public transportation is better than spend money on internet access.
5.0	On the other hand, if the government just spend a little money on public transportation, it will result people go outside became dangerous on the road.
8.0	For example, when you drive to a mountain during a dirt road, and the road don't have balustrade.
8.0	In case of I driving in there, and I was drop in the cliff.
8.0	I think I will die in the cliff.
8.0	So that it's so dangerous.
8.0	Although you can get a good phone and internet, you can't ensure your alive safety.
8.0	So that is the second reason why i think the government should spend a lot of money on public transportation.
1.0	So my conclusion is government spend money on public transportation is better than spend money on internet access.
1.0	The government also can spend a lot of money on internet access cause it about people entertainment, but my conclusion is public transportation is more important than the internet access.
3.0	Nowadays, there are more and more people in this world, also more and more people come to and live in our country.
11.0	That means this world become more diverse and can accept more cultural differences.
11.0	So now we must face a serious problem is that if we need take history courses no matter what our field of study is.
12.0	Someone hold on to the argument that this should depand on the students.
11.0	Nevertheless, my answer definitely is yes.
10.0	And it can help us commiuncate or cooperate with others better.
12.0	Furthermore, we can know this world better.
5.0	To begin with, I strongly believe it can equip the students with a more competiitive edge in their daily life and future career.
8.0	It will be easier for a person to get along with others, because human is a kind of soical animals, they need work with others, study with others and live with others, then we must talk with others and discuss with others.
8.0	Therefore, learning how to tell to others your ideas and feelings is very vital for us.
8.0	So the histoy of this country or city is a good subject for us.
8.0	For example, if you go other city to find a job, and u must work together with your colleague, you need to discuss everything small things, also make every imporant decisions.
8.0	But when you first come to this city, you even don't know each other, so now history is a good topic.
8.0	If you know the history and tradition of this city, then you will be closer quickly and faster.
8.0	Furthmore, you can get into this job quickly and collaborate more smoothly.
5.0	Secondly, learning history can help you to have more in-depth understanding of the world.
2.0	And this is a good way for you to have many means of the same things or problems, because when the people know this world better, their mind will be more wide and mature.
10.0	To
3.0	Currently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among public: should teachers be paid at least as much as doctors, lawyers or business leaders are paid.
3.0	Opinions vary from person to person.
3.0	Some claim that teachers should not be paid at least as much as doctors, lawyers or business.
12.0	However, i hold an opposite view that teachers definitely should be paid at least as much as these workers.
5.0	First, being paid as much as doctors, lawyers or business leaders may contribute to creative new ways to educate students.
8.0	It is because if there is much payment for teachers, more and more people would like to be a teacher in the future and they would have more ideas on education.
8.0	If teachers are paid for little salary, so many students would choose to be a doctor, lawyer ot business leader without devoting them to the develpment of education.
8.0	My math teacher is always complaining that he is paid too less, and he has to do some part-time job for his new house.
8.0	In this way, he just pay less attention to teaching and finally will never create some new methods which may have a better conclusion on teaching.
8.0	So, if teachers are paid as much as doctors, lawyers or business leaders are paid, they may more likely to create efficient ways for education.
5.0	Second, education is one of the most impotant fields among the development of every country.
8.0	Only if the teachers are paid as least as doctors, lawyers or business leaders are paid can show the importance of education while a country is quickly developing.
8.0	It is researched that China pay 3 to 4 percent of GDP on education while America pay about 16 percents of GDP on education.
8.0	It is all known that the education of America is the best around the world and teachers who work for American schools are always paid higher than other country, which is always concerned that teachers in America are paid as much as dotcors, lawyers or business leaders.
8.0	It shows that teacher should be paid more, at least as much as doctors, lawyers or business leaders are paid, to show that a country is pay much attention to develpment of education.
2.0	In summary, from what has discussed above, we can safely draw a conclusion that teachers shoud be paid as much as doctors, lawyers or business leaders are paid.
3.0	Nowadays, since the country is develping in a really fast speed, how to make full use of the land is becoming a popular topic among citizens.
3.0	Some people think that the government should build new housing to replace old buildings so that the city can catch up with the quick speed of development.
12.0	However, I suggest that preservation of old and historic buildings is much more important because it can remind up people a sense of proudness and bring more opportunities for the city deveopment.
4.0	Firstly, historic buildings can let citizens know the backgroud story of their city, which will make them be more familiar with the place they live in so that they will gain a sense of belonging and be proud of their own home.
8.0	For example, Wuhan government is really value of preserving old buildings.
8.0	There are many historic buildings that are well protected since the world war two where many schools arrange their students to visit and learn the history.
8.0	After a specific studying, this young generation becomes loving their country and city deeper and deeper.
4.0	In addition, the government can also benefit from the historic building by using them attract more tourists and comsumers.
9.0	For example, in Wuhan, the government successfully combine the historic buildings and shopingmall to produce a popular tourism center that not only tourists but also local citizens are willing to go there.
9.0	The government on the one hand creates a lot of financial opportunities, on the other hand well advertises the city to the world.
4.0	Some people may think that the city need more morden buildings to fit the development and those old buildings are useless and dangerous.
8.0	Meanwhile, the old buiding can also be used for morden things since the government well repaired the old building and exchange it inside.
8.0	The historic building can also be rebuilt.
8.0	It is the symbol and history that matters for a city.
2.0	Above all I strongly ask the government to well preserve the old and historic buildings for its proudness-bringing value and finacial benefition.
3.0	Nature abhors a vacumm, the incoming of the new era always accompany with questions.
3.0	Nowadays, whether children now spend more time on finishing their school tasks or taking part in the organized activites related to school or sports becomes a controversial problem.
3.0	Some people think that the children in the past spend more time in these events caused by their highly competitiveness conditions.
11.0	However, the other people think that the current children spend more time in these because their hugh pressure exerted on them.
11.0	In my own opinion, i agree with this statement.
4.0	Firstly, the current social developments allow children to learn more things.
8.0	As the development of globalization which is refered to the combination of different cultural and trade.
8.0	and the incresement of the economic growth.
8.0	It is not uncommon that children will be requested to learn more things.
8.0	For example, my friend Chen, a Chinese student, is requested to learn English content and participate in the english activities.
8.0	Therefore, Chen need to spend more time on english homework and preparation of the activites.
4.0	Secondly, the increasing living standard allow Children to have better platform to learn.
8.0	The current living standard is much more better than the past.
8.0	People can afford their basic need on food, water and tuition, but even more, people can send Children to some extra-curriculum courses such piano, basket ball courses.
8.0	Children will have more things to learn and more activites to paticipate.
8.0	Take me as a example, my parents used to send me to a piano class.
8.0	In this class, teacher will assign me homework to deal with and ask me to practice everyday.
8.0	Therefore, i got more tasts other than my school homeworks.
8.0	So the time i spend on these work incresing a lot.
4.0	Admittedly, the Children in the past may spend more time because they believe that the knowledge will change their destinies.
8.0	Hence, there are all industial students who put most time on study.
8.0	However, many families in the past cannot afford the tuition of they children.
8.0	Many of the children  have  no chances to study so they spend no time on it.
8.0	Nonetheless, currently, many families have the financial ability to support the Children to attend study or even expend to extra-curriculum courses which will let children spend more time on their tasks.
8.0	Therefore, Children nowadays will spend more time on their tasks than the children in the past.
2.0	All in all, because aforehead reason, i agree with the idea that Cilldren nowdays will spend more time on their tasks than the children in the past.
3.0	Nowadays, many people are talking about how to make a good decisions.
3.0	Some people like to make a determination by themselves.
11.0	But the other prefer to depend on what their parents say.
11.0	But in my opinion, i think making decisions by myself is a better choice.
4.0	Admittedly, I have to say that depending on what people's parents say is a good point.
8.0	Since people's parents must be older than yound people so that parents are always experienceing much more things than the yound men do.
8.0	It's known that if one person has been though many things , he must be full of expeience.
8.0	In this case,parents will always have more knowledge so that depending on their parents is a good choice.
8.0	However, determining by yourself have more advantages.
4.0	Firstly,deciding by themselves can help people be independent  quickly.
8.0	Since all of people's determinations are from people's mind  so that whether or not people make a wrong or a correct decision,people can gain a lot of expericen.
8.0	If people get a lot of experience, people will get to think by themselves unavoidable.
8.0	For example, one of my friends start to decide by himself form a young age.
8.0	Now he can live by himself without concerning by his paretns.
4.0	Thirdly,deciding by themselves can make you fit the change in  the future.
8.0	if people get to determin by themselves.
8.0	They will start to get used to depend on themselves.
8.0	Since everyone knows the future will be uncertain.
8.0	So everything will change in the futur.
8.0	Even the people's most depended men like parents will disapear one day.
8.0	But if people get to determin by themselves.
8.0	The man they depended most will get to be themselves.
8.0	For instace, my ancle, used to be the most happiest man, now is poor because of  the death of his mother.
8.0	Thanks to the fact that he has started to decide by himself so that he don't  depend on  anyone except himself.
2.0	Therefore,deciding by themselves is better.
3.0	We  all know that a lot of parents prefer to give money to their kids for a gift just because the baby done a good job on thire's study.
11.0	but for this case ,there have some diffirent opinion .
11.0	some people agree with parents behaiver ,others disagree,For me  , I  think  is a good idear for childerens study .
5.0	on the one hand ,kids can get energy for parents money.
8.0	Kids  always  need to spend too much time for getting a good grade, for their's efort ,I think a gift is a good ativation for them to continouen  work hard  .
8.0	it can give them a poewerful  energe.
8.0	spacially the gift comes from their's family.
5.0	On the other hand ,children can get love from the money,  not only good grade ,some times children also can do some housework ,if they can do some work by themsilfs  ,they will reserve some  gift .
9.0	gift can tell them they have done a good thing  ,they have done a good behaver.
9.0	so they will do lots of things like this.
2.0	In addition .
9.0	money as a gife when kids have done something good ,is a good way to enspair them.
9.0	it can makes them happy ,is good for their's improve.
7.0	so i agree parents give money to kids if  they have done
3.0	With the mounting amount of pressure and tension coming from school and work, people in the contemporary society are thrilled to find methods of relaxing and releasing stress.
3.0	Some individuals prefer to watch a movie or read a book, while others are more likely to get a splendid communication with mother nature.
3.0	From my personal perspective, I prefer the latter.
11.0	I strongly disagree that it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.
5.0	Speaking off the top of my head, physical exercises provide us health, which is one of the basic needs being a human.
8.0	With such a compact daily life, we need long lasting energy to help us maintain a refreshing spirit.
8.0	People are not able to accomplish their work efficiently when they are sick.
8.0	For instance, my friend Bob, you can say that he hates exercising mare than anyone.
8.0	He is also obviously obese.
8.0	During weekends and vacations, he just stays at home and do nothing besides watching movies and playing video games.
8.0	He is always refreshed when he returns to school.
8.0	But he did not gain any advantage from this in the long term.
8.0	After a period of time, his grades started dropping gradually and he always argues with all of his friends.
8.0	The school nurse said that his diet is out of balance and that he is always in a bad mood.
8.0	We dicovered that this problem is so severe that it has to be solved immediately, so we helped Bob to sign up a sports summer camp.
8.0	As a result, he developed all kinds of sports skills and he is more outgoing after he lost weight.
5.0	On the other side, by doing exercises, we get exposed to a gigantic number of opportunities to communicate with others.
8.0	I used to be shy, I am always isolated at the cinema or at the library.
8.0	My grades are not very high at the moment, which made me more indrawn.
8.0	Even though I always try to relax, I was still exhausted.
8.0	But everything turned out to be the opposite after I participated in a baseball team, we were such a strong bond.
8.0	It seemed that our hearts were connected together and that I was more eager to make friends.
8.0	When I do physical exercise to relax, I gain a huge sense of achievement and confidence.
2.0	All in all, doing physical exercise are extremely beneficial to individuals in the modern society, especially the ones who are always trying hard to keep pace with the rapid rate of our daily life pattern.
7.0	Health and communication are the two viatal things w
3.0	With the time goes by,modern technologes made a large progress.
3.0	There are a  large number of ways that we can choose to be relaxed.
11.0	Besides,some people are willing to watch movies or reed book rather than  do physical exercise.
11.0	But in my opinion,Compared with other things ,dong exercise is the most important things in our life.
12.0	Following reasons can prove my  views strongly
6.0	As we al know,reading or watching can open our eyes to the word but ont the one hand if someone only has wordwile   eyes and  has a large number of knowleges does not have healthy body.
9.0	Nomatter how much knowlege he has,it will be long.
9.0	On the other hand ,If someone who is relaxed by doing physical exercise rather than watching or reading ,Not only will he or she be relaxed ,but also she or he become more and more healthy and his body may be stronger than before and in the future,they have much extra time to watch or read.
7.0	From what I have discuss above ,We can safely draw a conclusion that do
3.0	Nowadays, young children often make various mistakes.
12.0	It is a inevitable road that everyone must step on.
11.0	so, when facing these problems, I always agree that parents shoud let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.
5.0	To start with, creativity needs one to make mistakes.
8.0	In contemporary society, it is essentially to cultivate one's creativity due to drastic competition.
8.0	However, success often follows failure.
8.0	Take Edison for instance, he invented thousands of inventions after thousand and thousand failure.
8.0	It is impossible for him to creat masterpiece if he didn't suffer such amount of failure and mistakes.
8.0	So, it is same with everyone that it is unavoidable to make mistakes when you would like to forster your creativity and become more confidencial.
5.0	Secondly, mistakes boost one's study and life experience.
8.0	As we all know, both study and life need a sum of pratical experience that can help us to adapt to the real society.
8.0	Surely, mistakes can play the role of the helper.
8.0	When we make mistakes, our brain will naturally learn the process and tell ourselves that it is a wrong way to do so, and we can get the memory quickly.
8.0	The is the most efficient way to learn a totally new thing.
8.0	In addition, this is a chance for children to accumulate study and life experience independently.
8.0	So, for parents, let their children learn the mistakes they have made is no question a best way to teach.
2.0	After all, let children make the mistakes that they should make is the proper way for parents to educate.
3.0	With the advent of the mature society, people are engaged by more things, such as working, studying or raising a family.
3.0	Some people may think the more people are doing different things, the less they are likely to do a good job.
11.0	Nevertheless, as far as I am concerned, people can still do things well on multiple things.
12.0	Here are my reasons.
4.0	To begin with, doing different things acts as an important role to add color to people's lives, which will make them excited and do a better job.
8.0	If a person only does a single thing, he may definitely get dull and find no motivation to continue.
8.0	I used to spent all my time in study and I seldom exercise.
8.0	Everytime my classmates went to play basketball when they were free, I just stayed in the classroom and read books.
8.0	As a result, I easliy got tired beacuse I found it no more interest in studying.
8.0	On the contrary, my classments who often exercised, could studied more effective and were more likely to be indulged in study and did a better job than I did.
4.0	Moreover, when being engaged in different things, people can get diverse knowledge, which can help people do a good job in another area.
8.0	In university, I came across a roomate who liked to play video games but could also do a brilliant job in study.
8.0	Playing computer games, she got to know so many attributes and functions of computers that were cirtical for wining a game.
8.0	As a result, when we studyed our major which was relative to computers, she always knew much more knowledge than any other students, which helped her a lot in her studying process.
4.0	It is true that people's energy is limited and they may get tired when facing so many things.
8.0	However, this does not necessarily mean they do few things well.
8.0	If we are burden with so many things, we can still choose the most important things to finish.
8.0	For example, when we are so busy with working, we can limit our time of playing with friends, which means we can still assure one aspect is been done well.
8.0	On the other hand, we can also learn how to manage our time and energy in that process, know how precious the time is and cherish it, which is vital in the future life.
2.0	In summary, I reinforce the idea that people can do excellent job when facing different things, for different things offers us way to get our mind off a single thing, making us understand diverse things and let us know the importance of time management.
3.0	Nowadays, people say that it is more difficult to teach children than in the past.
12.0	There are many reason why they think so: Cell phones and online games may distract kids attention.
12.0	Also, social network gives children the possibility to make bad friends and absorb violent information.
11.0	However, in my opinion, kids are more likely to be educated now.
4.0	First, students spend not that much time on games.
8.0	Most students now are self-disciplined and know what should and should not do.
8.0	Wanting to play games, they may do their homework more quickly and squeeze time to play.
8.0	Some will also have a certain period of time of a day to play.
8.0	Besides, students who are not self-disciplined can be supervised by their parents.
8.0	It is possible that their parents will only give them their cell phones or let them use computer on weekends.
8.0	It is really not a problem that children will be difficult to teach now because of these.
4.0	In addition, kids using social network website may make good friends who have valuable spirits or interesting skills that attract them and they can learn a lot from these friends.
4.0	Furthermore, with the society developing, kids now have more chances to be educated.
8.0	There are better social welfares which let students study for nine years for free.
8.0	This may make it easier for kids whose family is poor to go to school.
8.0	Also, people are wealthier now than in the past.
8.0	They will have more resources to get their k
1.0	In conclusion, though the distractions are fewer in the past, it is easier to educate kids now.
1.0	Thus, children themselves should also take the advantages of today's society and study harder.
12.0	In such a highly competitive society, people are paying an increasing amount of attention to educate children.
8.0	People's interest in the debate that whether more difficult for educating children today than it was in the past.
8.0	Different people present dissimilar opinion.
8.0	Some people in society think that educating children is easier today than in the past.
8.0	However, I disagree.
8.0	When it comes to the statement that educating children is more difficult task today than it was in the past, I strongly agree.
6.0	First of all, many technology products can disturb children to study, because they can ues a lot of time to play games on the computer and they can use cell phone to communicate with other people, they often wallow in these.
8.0	For example, I like playing computer game called LOL, when I was a junior high school student.
8.0	I discuss the LOL at school and play it after shcool every day, which leads to a serious decline in my academic performance.
8.0	My parents criticize me but I do not want to listen and argue with them, and they are worried about me playing games.
3.0	Many students have a same question, that is, should they study harder by spending more time on their own study tasts or get along well with other people.
12.0	It is a always controversial questions.
11.0	One would say that they should spend more time on their own study tasts.
11.0	However, from my point of view, the ability to relate well to people is more important than studying hard in school for reasons: They can balance their school life and they will know some people helpful for succes in a future job.
5.0	First, students can balance their school life by relating well to other people.
8.0	What they should do in school is studying hard, but it is always hard and boring for students studying for a long time every day.
8.0	Furthermore, they should enrich their time after class.
8.0	when they spend more time with other people, the problem will be solved.
8.0	Studens can spend time together do what they want to develop their friendship.
8.0	They can develop their ability to relate well to other people in campus.
8.0	Here is a real example of my friend James.
8.0	He used to be very shy person.
8.0	we became very good friends becasue both of us like to play basketball.
8.0	we spent much time together in school.
8.0	I recomended many of my good friends to him, later all of us became friends.
8.0	After we graduated and everybody went to work, he called me once.
8.0	He said he appreciated me very much because the friends I recomended to him helped him a lot about his job.
5.0	Second, students will know some people helpful for success in a future job.
8.0	It is very easy to make friends in campus, because there is much less interest dispute.
8.0	Students will make friends with people who have same major.
8.0	These people can be friends forever.
8.0	For instance, when I was studying in university, I made many friends who has same major with me -- communication studies.
8.0	We spent lots of time study when we were in campus.
8.0	After we graduated from school, most of us found jobs that related to our major.
8.0	I was also accepted by a company and my job is about jounalism.
8.0	I was confused about everything in our company.
8.0	I was too shy to ask my coworkers, so I asked one of my friends Koko who was a journalist.
8.0	He told me a lot of things that were very helpful to me.
8.0	That's how important to relate well to people in school.
1.0	To sum up, although it is very important to study hard in school, but the ability to relate well to people is more important for success in a future job.
1.0	The advantages are balancing school life and knowsome people helpful for success in a future job.
12.0	Teachers now will assign more work which need the students to work together because they think that students will learn more effectively in that way instead of one student learns the whole thing alone.
11.0	I agree with this idea for several reasons.
4.0	Admittedly, learning alone sometimes can be more effective than working in a group because some members of your group can be very noisy and they may do nothing but chatting with each other and this behavior will seriously affect your efficiency.
10.0	On the other hand, if you learn by yourselve, there are less distraction and you can learn in a more quiet environment which is good for increasing your efficiency.
4.0	Although sometimes working alone can be very productive, working with a group always can be more effiective because there are more people to finish a project which means there are more resources which can be allocated.
8.0	For example, a person needs three days to finish a project.
8.0	However, a group which contains three to four people can finish the same projet for only one day.
8.0	The reason why the group can finish the assignment much faster is that they have more people which means they can distribute the work into seperate parts and each one just needs to handle only one part of a hugh work.
8.0	In this way, each person will need to do less work but they can finish the work in less time, which shows that working in a group can be more effective than working alone.
4.0	Finally, working alone for all the time can be a very boring thing because there is nobody to chat with you.
8.0	There are just you and your assignment.
8.0	people can jsut give up whatever they are doing because of boring under this condition.
8.0	However, if you work with your teammates, when you feel bored, you can just invite your group members to have a little games between you to have a little rest.
8.0	Believe it or not, this little rest can make you very productive when you start working again because you just release yourselve and now you are ready to do more work.
8.0	Imagine that, if you just work for one thing alone for the whole day, it can drive you crazy and lead you to quit this which makes there are no efficiency to compare.
8.0	Working with your group can not only make you feel alot easier becasue you don' have to do all the work by your selve, you can also chat or play games with your teammates, it is so much fun than just working alone.
2.0	in conclusion, I agree with the idea which states that working with your group can be more effective since you just need to finsih your part in that assignment and you will not feel bored.
3.0	Nowadays, more and more younge people never concerned about the historical events.
12.0	But being a citizen of this country, people should be know more about the history.
12.0	In paeticular, contemporay college students must understand historical facts.
12.0	This will help them in their future works.
12.0	So I think the university students should increase history courses.
6.0	First of all, there are many reasons and spirits for us to learn from historical events.
9.0	There are common  characteristics of historical events and current events.
9.0	For example, the policy called closed door tells us that we should accept more new things.
7.0	In the proccess
3.0	Books and movies play an important role in mordern individuals' daily lives, on which we spend our time to relax ourselves.
3.0	Different people will have different ideas about this question.
3.0	Some people think the books can reflect the way how someone look the world.
3.0	Others think firmly that it doesn't matter which kind of movies or books we choose.
11.0	Personally, I think the books and movies is a significant part of life, which can greatly help us to learn about a person.
5.0	As we all know, the types people reading books and movies reflect how they see the world and their view of life.
8.0	Moreover, which people had read affects their character and quality.
8.0	The person who like reading the fairy tales are more likely to be naive, and a fan of science fiction movies tend to have a great imagination.
8.0	The species of movies and books we had read have gone to be a part of us.
5.0	If you learn about a person's favorite books and movies, we will have more common topics with him, which means we are more likely to become close with each other.
8.0	As the saying goes that the best way to learn about someone is to be a friend.
8.0	Last summer I met a beautiful girl, who is so cute and smart that I really want to learn more about her.
8.0	I began to inquire about her love of books, and go to see the same film with her, which cultivate changes to discuss with her about the stories and the characters.
8.0	By this way, we became good friends, and I learn more about her unknown parts.
8.0	That's how the favorite books and movies works.
2.0	While some people think we should focus only on more significant parts like world outlooks, I believe that the books and movies are the indispensable step to learn about a stranger.
11.0	I think it's not a good idea for some parents to give their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.
12.0	First,studying hard is one of the duties for a child.
11.0	During the growth,children learn much knowledge to enrich their brain and open their views.
11.0	Study should be a enjoyable thing,not a annoying stuff.
8.0	When parents award their children for each high grade they get ,it's just like to encourge them to regard study as boring work.
8.0	Second,giving money is not a wise choice to encourage children.
8.0	We can consider other ways,like going to a movie,playing in the zoo with his friends...
8.0	It will be a little early for the parents to give money as the gift to their children' achievement.
6.0	Third,parents all know it's not a easy thing to earn money and their children should know that too.
9.0	Only when the children get the first gold of their life,will they know it's how difficult to earn money--much harder than get a high grade!
9.0	Through this way,they can be more independent and nuture.
7.0	Through offering money to the school-aged children can take credict to them,
12.0	Nowadays, more and more students choose to watch movies or read books for relaxing instead of doing physical exercise.
12.0	But why not to choose to doing exercise for relaxing?
11.0	In my opinion, I agree that it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book.
4.0	First, a vast of students must have experienced a tired and boring school-day.
8.0	So, what they really need is just to relax.
8.0	It is harmful to them if they insist on doing exercise, because they have used their brians frequently for a whole day.
8.0	Also, diong exercise may bring many extra pressure to themselves.
4.0	Second, Choosing a better way to relax themselves can let them be more peaceful and self-confident to the future exercise.
10.0	Watch movies and reading books may be popular ways to relax, they can relax themselves totally during the process that they can forget their pains and struggles on doing exercise.
4.0	Third, it is hard to take their variable time to relax.
9.0	And this is a good method to them to bounce back when they want to give up doing exercise.
9.0	Meanwhile, it can practice and help them to bulid their intrests and hobbies on movies and books, also can let them gain a vast of knowledge and views besides learning from the schools.
4.0	All in all, to relax by watching movies and reading books not only can decrease their pressure, but also can expand their horizons.
9.0	Always doing physical exercise just can lead them to the edge of giving up and lose confidence to themselves.
9.0	It is terrible to do it.
1.0	Namely, choose to use any other methods to relax is better than doing physical exercise, especially by watching movies or reading books.
1.0	And i suggest all students try to do this and avoid great pressure form their schools and any kind of exercise.
3.0	Nowadays, many people are still staying in their office and finishing the work whic they don't like.
11.0	Besides, the manager need to come up with enough ideas to make himself or herself sucessful, even they are exhausted and don't want to do it anymore.
12.0	These are all the phenomena that shows us that people are spending too much time on the things they don't like.
5.0	First, the stress of life are forcing people to find a job and keep a job to support themselves even they hate the job, which takes much time of people's life.
8.0	Take a famous singer for an instance, when his career was not so good as now, he had to fing a way to earn money, then he chose to sell clothes in the Internet.
8.0	When he was asked about this experience, he told the reporter that he hated to sold clothes because it was so tired.
8.0	But he still held on to it, because this work coul dbring him money which would help a lot for him to publish his own ablum, so he coul dbring his singer career back to life.
8.0	So people need to do things they don't like for some practical reasons.
5.0	Secondly, people all want to become sucessful, but through the journey to sucess, there are quantities of things that we hate a lot, even so peopple still choose to do these things because their enthusiasm to be sucessful.
8.0	I have read a story about an advettisement company manager.
8.0	In order to come up with some good ideas about advertisement, he force himself to think about three ideas about the products which are advertised on the subway he need to take to work place every day..
8.0	Even he says that this is so hard for him.
8.0	He still work on this, because sucess is so attractive to him that he will force himself to do the things he should do instead of the things he hates to do.
0.0	Last, some people are arguing that the park which is a place for peole to do what they want to do is uaually filled with people, and this can be used as a reason to suppor that people are tend to spend much time on things they like to do.
0.0	On the contrary, they do the things they like because they need to get refreash so that they can face the work tomorrow.
0.0	We can see people are walking in park everytime, but if you observing carefully, you can find that the expression on their faces are always show that they are very tired.
0.0	So they need to have some relax to get a better situation when they are back to work.
3.0	Currently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among student: We will be happier and more successful in the city than in the native village and town.
3.0	Opinions vary from person to person.
3.0	Some claim that stay in the native village or town is the best choice.
11.0	However, contrary to their view comes my perspective that we need to go to different places to expand our horizons.
5.0	Firstly, move out of native village or town can have more opportunity.
8.0	To be more specific, when we go to big cities, we will be exposed to new people and new jobs, so we will have more choices in life.
8.0	On the contrary, if when stay in the native village or town.
8.0	Our job opportunities and friends will be limited because there wll be very few people in the town and native village, so if we stay long, we will have very few choices in life.
8.0	for example, i  was born in a small town of 500 people.
8.0	So our bussiness, education and economy are lagging behind than other town.
8.0	So my dream since childhood is to study and work in a big city.
8.0	At last i went to a big city, and i made a lot  of friends, so when i was gratuate, i open a company with my big city's friends and a got a lot of money and help my town to be better.
5.0	Secondly, there will be more friends in the big city.
8.0	To be more specific, because there are so few peole in the town, it's hard to find friends with the same hobbies, the right personality and even the right lover.
8.0	On the contrary, if we are i a small town, we may not find the right friends and loved ones.
8.0	If we do not find it , we wil be handicapped in life.
8.0	Because we may be alone forevery.
3.0	In my point of view ,  I personally don't agree with the oppinion that people today are more willing to help the struggling strangers.
3.0	Admittedly , there truly exist people who are very sympathetic and willing to offer strangers with enthusiasm without any feedback.
3.0	However , this phenomenom is not common.
3.0	Generally speaking , the existence of mobile phones and other high-tech products make a vital influnce on people's comunnication method .
3.0	Comparing with verbal communication , people today may prefer to use social media  which can help aviod embarrasement.
3.0	As we have stayed in such circumstance for a long time and are lack of face-to-face contact opportunity with others , our communication ability may decline .
12.0	Because of this ,we may  not be brave enough  to have further contact with strangers and offer them kindness, even though our service may be helpful to them .
6.0	For the other reason , being vigilant  when contacting with strangers is our subconscious.
8.0	For most people , they are just willing to hlep others only if they are their relatives and friends  or there exists some connection between them .
8.0	It's hard for a people to put himself into helping strangers and devote something for them.
8.0	Most of times , this only occurs  when doing this is beneficial for them because people often regard profits as a more important concern .
2.0	To conclude ,people today may be less willing to help strangers.
11.0	To be clear, I agree that young people nowadays are not given enough time to help their communities.
12.0	it's still debatable whether the children are busier compared to the past.
11.0	But I think being a kid is not easier compare to the past indeed.
9.0	And taking in the account of urbanization, less and fewer people regard themselves live in a community.
9.0	And I will explain that in the following passages.
4.0	To begin with, some studies show that it's hard for people to find time in someone's schedule if the person did not want to do the thing.
10.0	In today's societies, more and more people move from the suburbs to cities and live in an apartment that will not have a lot of chance to talk to the neighbors.
4.0	So people don't regard themselves live in a community anymore.
8.0	As a consequence, kids don't want to contribute to the communities anymore.
8.0	And for more, teacher and parent don't require the kids to do it anymore.
8.0	Therefore, teacher and parents will not make time for the kids to contribute to the communities, and kids don't want to do it so they make up excuses to avoid it.
8.0	So from that perspective, indeed, the kids don't have enough time to helping their communities.
4.0	Second, I think the kids can't help their communities even if they want to.
8.0	Children have less and less time to spend with their families due to the increase of the time spent in school or homework, and not forget that we have social media.
8.0	To illustrate, I am a high school student, and the high school is the busiest stage in our lives and that is supposable.
8.0	I need to go to school really early, like 6 am and I usually arrived at home very late, like 9 pm but I still need to do my home works despite that I already studied for 15 hours.
8.0	So after I got home, there is not the time for me to doing anything that I want except login my Facebook and post a picture and read some commons and finally, go to bad.
8.0	Soi seems I don't have any time to do something to help my community at all even that I want to.
1.0	So to wrap up, kids now a day do not have enough time for the communities, because the teacher and parents regard the communities less seriously.
1.0	And simply because the children themselves are too busy
11.0	Well,I think it is not bad.
12.0	Here are some of my opinions towards this idea.
12.0	First,it is frankly to say that kids also need their own money to spend.
8.0	Their parents won't stay with them all the time ,as a matter of fact,some personal money is requisite.
8.0	Though they do not have any income ,their parents should think is as their duty to offer them some applicable  money to spend.
8.0	And then , it is imperivate that kids' self-control ability should be practiced.
8.0	Money is just a symbol of attemp,in this way ,parents can let their kids be aware of the importance of this.
8.0	It is the process of their independence.
8.0	As what I have said,parents won't stay with their kids forever, soon one day, they will have to face to alluring world on their own.
8.0	And it is hard to think that what will happen to a man who even doesn't  know how to manage his money.
6.0	Every coin has its two sides.
8.0	If parents and the kids can not make an aggreement on it ,or the kids are spoiled,and things like these.
8.0	Money offer may not be a proper choice for them.
8.0	No matter what we do ,the only aim is to let our kids grow healthily.
8.0	whether offer kids money or not,depend on the current condition between parents and kids.
8.0	For example ,if a kid who always gets good grades in school,and show great self-control towards his parents.
8.0	Now it is proper to give him some money as another challenge.
8.0	If a boy who always behaves badlly,and often do such naughty things,the parents might think twice wether give him some money or not .
0.0	All in all,I still think offerring kids money is a certain way of growth.
0.0	But all of us should think the best way of ourselves.
0.0	Maybe not offering money ,we can offer other sorts of supporting.
11.0	Everyone has thier own dreams, and everyone who has dreams deserve to be respected.
11.0	In my opinion, no matter what a job the children choose, it is independant from his parents.
12.0	What laeds a man to success is not parents but oneself own power.
5.0	As the old saying goes, interest is the best teacher.
8.0	If the child has no interest on this major, on this job, he won't feel any joy from it, and after some days.
8.0	he will get frustrated and finally give up the job.
8.0	I have a friend, Oliver.
8.0	Both his parents are doctors and actually they are famous and capable.
8.0	Living in a family like this, they all want him to be a doctor like them.
8.0	After study medical major for one year, he really find this is not suit him, and his grades was low.
8.0	Finally, he gave up.
8.0	So as you see, without interest, chidren will not find the passion to deal with the problem.
8.0	So interest is more important than other things.
5.0	Besides that, everyone has a target.
8.0	Because different peoples have different dreams, in the most situation, children's dreams are different from thier parents.
8.0	So it is not need to push the parents' dream to their children.
8.0	As you see, Da Vince is one of the most famous artist in  trhe world, but his parents are just school teachers.
8.0	So if they push him to do the job as theirs, perhaps there will lost a alot of great paintings and inventions nowadays.
8.0	Bach, the famous pianoist, his father was a math scholar.
8.0	So from those famous people, you will see, there is no need to following what parents did, just believe in oneself.
0.0	Last but not least, it is true that if you follow your parents' steps, you will make less mistakes.
0.0	But on the other hand, on the road we fight for our dreams, every tiny problem is a great treasure.
0.0	Those experience will enrich our life, and that is invaluable asset.
3.0	everyone makes mistake,when parents bring up their children,some people think parents shpule let their children make mistakes and learn form own mistakes ,but others donnot think so.
12.0	as far a i am  concerned ,i perfer the fomer.
4.0	the children make mistakes in childhood makes them have less mistakeson their adult period.
8.0	if someone make mistakes ,which give himself a good lesson ,their will noy wan to make it again.
8.0	so chilren will be careful on their way to do same thing.
8.0	which bring up a good habit-careful,and it also is benefit to other things in their life.
8.0	he will pay  more attention to doing significant things on his whole life,and it is  good at his development ,
4.0	when chilren responsible for their mistakes,they will have more resiponsibilty for his lift.
8.0	that is a good habit,everytime he do something that is  not familar ,he will concern it  one by one.
8.0	it will make him  make less mistakes  althought hw will make lots of mistake on their childhood .
8.0	but in his childhood ,the mistake's bad i bring little influence on their life,even not so ,their parents will aslo help them solve the problem.
8.0	but in his adult period ,her parents may can't solve it.
4.0	last but  noy least,parent cannot ambanam their child ,it's not a love and  is a hurt.
8.0	when your child is a child ,you can give him what he want.,do what  he want to do ,and solve the difficult for him.
8.0	it will make him without rule.
8.0	when he be a adult, he might to solve problem with unlegal way which will cause big problem for him.
8.0	and beacause of ambannam,he mingt to think his parents donnot love him or without big ability that is bad for relationship between family,
2.0	so i think child  shold make mistakes and let them learn fromm own mistakes .
3.0	Some parents want to encourage their children by giving them money when they get good grade.
11.0	I don't consider that it is good idea.
11.0	In my mind, encouraging is important for a kid, because parents' gifts can inspire them to study more hard.
12.0	The gift is not money.
5.0	In my high school, same classmates can get money by getting high mark, but many of them will down in next test.
8.0	The reason of this happed is arrogant.
8.0	They think they had get good grade and get thier parents' gift, they are good students.
8.0	If they can't keep thier minds, they will sad when they can next grade.
5.0	For example ,i always get good grade in chemical science ,but my parents never give my money, they think it's my duty.
9.0	Studying hard and more knowledge is students' duty in school.
9.0	I agree them, because our parents pay much money to support us study is the best gift.
10.0	In other way,
3.0	Nowdays, the car-industry is very properous, a big amount of family have car.
3.0	It become the essential part of our life and work.
3.0	But in my opinion I agree with the point that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.
3.0	Because of the development of the public transportation,and the think to protect the environment.
3.0	Futhermore the goverment will push the family who have the car to drive the car.
5.0	Firstly,with the improvement of the public transportation, people will prefer to choose the public transportations.
8.0	Because they are more efficiency and economical.
8.0	The traffic jam in the city is very terrible, and it will waste a lot of time.
8.0	But if we choose the public transportations, just like underground subway.
8.0	We could save many time.
8.0	For example, every morning I will go to school, it will take me one hour to the school by bus or individual cars.
8.0	So i will be  late to school.
8.0	On the other hand, if i take the subway, it just take me 25 minutes to there.
8.0	I save a lot of time.
8.0	So the subway is very convinient, not only that it is a good way to save money.
8.0	I think a lot of people will give up the car, shift to the subway.
5.0	Secondly, the thinking of protecting the earth environment become more and more popular.
8.0	There are some ogernization that focus on this aspect.
8.0	The gass that creat by the car have very big bad influence to the atmosphere.
8.0	So people will reduce the number of the car.
8.0	They may ride bick or walk on foot.
7.0	Finally, the goverment will reduce the number of the car, because it make the city very busy and complex
3.0	With the development of society, our living habits have been changed greatly.
11.0	One of the most significant changes is the tissue of whom we young people depend on when making a decision.
12.0	In the past, young people usually depended on their older family members, especially their parents.
11.0	However, in contemporary society, the young adults tend to make choice on their own.
10.0	Here are the resons.
5.0	First, in the past, the ways they acquired information, most of which come from experience, were limited.
8.0	It was parents who are much more experienced than their children.
8.0	In this case, they tended to  listen to parents' advice and let them to control determination.
8.0	As we all know, over the several decades, parents made the decision for their children who they would marry with in China.
8.0	At that time,  girls had no chance to meet the young men with the same age.
8.0	However, their parents had the permission to know their children's future partners through various ways.
8.0	Without doubt, it was a right choice to depend on their parents when making a decision in the past.
5.0	However, they can't get acess to a great amount of information, which do good to decision making nowadays.
8.0	Surfing on the Internet, clicking on the mouse, news will display on the computer screen within seconds.
8.0	What's more, after educating, they have learnt knowledge in a systematic way, which enable them to understand ourselves and the world better.
8.0	All of these create a good atmosphere for the young people to make decision on themselves.
8.0	According to a survey conducted by Peking University aiming to find out how students choose their majors, 80 percent of students depend on their own while less than 20% decided by their parents or teachers instead.
8.0	Most students are independent  nowadays.
8.0	They would listen to their parents, but it is themselves who determine the final choice.
10.0	Another importand reason is that some of adul
3.0	I can't agree with it in some way.
3.0	The methods of relaxing are supposed to be various.
3.0	"As the saying goes：“In the eyes of a thousand readers,it'll have a thousand Hamlett."""
11.0	Indeed,we can't give a cetain and onefold criteria about which is better on personal experiences.
12.0	Just like I prefer tea while you love chocolate for a drink during class break.
8.0	It would be weird and rude if someone says that it's obviously that tea is better than chocolate .
8.0	It is the same with the way we relax ourseleves.
8.0	Accordingly,I don't think watching a movie or reading a book is better than doing physical exercise.
6.0	As far as I'm concerned,I can feel content while doing lots of exercise,for regular and appropriate exercise will help me keep slim and be full of energy.
8.0	Through the process of sweating,I may get exhausted but this type of experience and toughening makes me have a sense of self-proud.
8.0	I can gradually learn to overcome those discomfort and the difficulities.
8.0	When I look back,all the sweats and lousy will disappear.
8.0	It seems to be self-torment,but I'll finally be reward with the pleasure.
7.0	However,it dosn't mean that I have no interest in watching movies and re
3.0	Recently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people: whether is more vital and decides your happiness, the ability of making new friends easily or the ability of maintaining friendship with a small group of people?
3.0	Opinions vary from person to person.
3.0	Some people claim that they think the ability of maintaining friendship with a small group of people is more important and will creat happiness.
3.0	However, I would stand on their opposite side and I believe that the ability of making new friends easily is more essential and decides happiness.
12.0	My viewpoints can be elaborated as follows.
5.0	Firstly, the ability of making new friends easily can cultivate an ability to fitting into a new environment very well.
8.0	Nowadays, teenagers become more and more shy and they prefer to stay in their comfortable zone.
8.0	They would not like to try new things or make new friends because they think they would not be accepted by them and they are worried that others would dislike them.
8.0	So the ability of making new friends easily become more and more important.
8.0	It is very crucial for people to adapt to a new environment because people can meet many good person which could bring more help to them.
8.0	Making new friends easily means that blending into a new group well.
8.0	Once people get along with new friends well, they would feel very happy because they could feel they are accepted.
8.0	For example, my brother was a very shy boy, when he graduated from his high school and came to the new university.
8.0	He told me he was unhappy everyday because he could not fit in the new friend circle well.
8.0	He felt very nervous since every time he standed out to answer professors' question, he thought his classmates would laugh at him.
8.0	Thus, his answer was not very well.
5.0	Secondly, the ability of making new friends easily can extend people's horizons.
8.0	Making new friends easily means that we can meet lots of people and learn much more things from them.
8.0	Every people would tell their unique personal experience, such as their homeland culture and their professional knowledge.
8.0	These things are priceless and very helpful and these can creat much happiness.
8.0	For example, I was a very outgoing girl and I like to make new friends.
8.0	Last year I went to Italy and met lots of people.
8.0	Some of them were American musicians, some were  Korean artists.
8.0	At that time, we got along very well and we became good friends.
8.0	They told me their traditional cultrue and I felt very excited and amazing.
2.0	All in all, I firmly think the ability of making new friends easily is more vital and decides people's happiness.
3.0	Educating children could be a lot different with it used to be, because new things have been coming out nowadays and the mind of educators are also changing.
12.0	As for the opinion that educating children is more difficult today since children are spending much time on mobile phone and Internet, it might not be that correct due to many other changes people have today.
4.0	It can't be denied that cell phone, online games and etc have been a phenomenon among the children, because they are not mature enough to manage to the addiction from electronic devices.
8.0	But this doesn't mean that children in the past didn't need to face temptation, which makes it not easy for their parents and teacher to control them.
8.0	Things like novels, TV dramas and etc are also strong attractions to children in the past, which indicates that this problem exists all the time and wasn't easier in the past.
8.0	This also requires people around the children to work on the problem together.
4.0	Despite the problem which technology brings to the children, it actually benefits more in education than the harm it does.
8.0	Nowadays children with cellphones can conveniently get in touch with their teachers and parents.
8.0	Once there's something wrong with the children, other people will be noticed as soon as possible.
8.0	It simplifies the problem which was hard to deal with in the past, and also improves the efficiency of education in an obvious way.
4.0	Meanwhile, educators today have more advanced educational minds and ways than they used to have.
8.0	While facing the problem children might have with those temptations, they can lead the children in an exact way and avoid the risk they might take in the past.
8.0	For instance, parents can set specific rules for their children to use electronic devices and encourage them to study better to gain more rewards.
8.0	Schools also have more detailed principles than yesterday protecting children from addiction, the assistance from each aspect of the society and the family is definitely building a better studying atmosphere for children.
1.0	Educating children is difficult all the time, but it needs the consistency from the educators.
1.0	Nowadays it should be easier than it used to be since people have found ways to deal more problems.
11.0	I disagree with the following statement that it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.
5.0	First of all, I think each person has their own styles to relax.
8.0	There are many methods to make people be relaxed.
8.0	Most of people like to do physical exercise, and other people like to watch a movie or read a book.
8.0	For example, the man who works in the fitness place, his duty is to help customers do the right poses on each machine.
8.0	He loves physical exercise, so he works at fitness store.
8.0	It is not necessary for him to relax by reading a book, otherwise, he can get relaxed by doing physical exercise.
8.0	This is my first opinion that I disagree with the statement.
5.0	In additional, I do not think it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.
8.0	There are many mathods to make people be relaxed, choosing a good method to relax depends on people's interests.
8.0	Different person has different interests.
8.0	Compare with my friend Lily, I prefer to watching a movie to get relaxed, but Lily prefers to do physical exercise.
8.0	In conclusion, I disagree with that it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.
8.0	I think it might depend on different interests.
1.0	All in all, I disagree with it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise, because I think the statement's opinion is too stronger.
1.0	We can not directly compare these methods, and I think it is aopen topic.
3.0	I personally think that it is a bad idea that some parents offer their school-age children for each high grade they get in school.
4.0	First of all,in this way, the children will get some money but they properply do not know how to spend it on a good mean.
8.0	In spite of some kids who can use ther money in the correct way or save them, most teens may not form a complete mind of money.
8.0	So they do not know how and where they can spend this money.
8.0	Even some peole who just become an adult  don't have.
4.0	Secondly, once some of the children who do not have a economical mind get some money by getting good grades in school, they may use some terreble ways to get high grades again like cheating.
10.0	So this way also may lead the kids to a crime because they might not satisfy with a few of money if they waste it.
4.0	The last, although the parents who giving money as a prize hope that they can encourge their children in this way, and they really harvest some a good news from their children, it may bring some bad mind and valuable standard which make  them believe that they must be able to get money by doing something they should do.
10.0	But when they graduate from school and work in a coperation, they will just realize that it is his or her duty to finish the work in same of their study.
11.0	In my opioion, I agree with this statement.
11.0	as the social development become faster and faster, the youny people need deal with a lot of things and master more skills to create more opportunities.
12.0	so they don't have enough tine to helpng their communities.
5.0	First of all, the young people are most students, they need deal with many acadamic task or homework, so they have not enough time to helping their conmmunities.
8.0	If they pay more time to communities works, they will be make the acadamic score declined.
8.0	For example,my communities creat a fantastics activity about take care some old people, I'm really enjoy to do it, but I facing a really important test, which will effect my credit score for my all semester.
8.0	so I must to deal with my school word, therefore, I will fail this test.
5.0	Secondly, the youny people always have some extra calss.
8.0	as everyone know, the competitive between young people is very radical, if you do not take some extra class, you knowledge points may less than other comtemporaries.
8.0	For instants, My best friend who is a high school student, she want to study aboard.
8.0	so she need take some extra class on rest time.
8.0	She discovered her communities are not clean, but she is so busy, she didn't have extra time to organize people to clean the communites.
1.0	All in all, although, a lots of youny people want to helping their communities, but they still have not enough time.
1.0	They most is students, they not only need deal with school work to ensure they have a good grade and go to good colladge, but also they need take extra classes to make they master more than one skill to have more opportunites to get jobs and go to some colledges.
3.0	I will never forget how excited I was when the nine-year-old girl stood before a TV set witnessing her national team winning the champion of 2008 Beijing Olympic Game.
3.0	It was the first time that I realized how important it is for government to support athletics.
11.0	Although some people may contend arts should be sponsored in stead of sports teams, as far as I am concerned, sports plays a more significant role in citizens' lives.
4.0	First and formest, government spending more money on athletics enable people gaining courage to defeat failure.
8.0	There is no doubt that each person wish his or her national Olympics team would always be the winner.
8.0	However, competitive games expose us to the possibility of failing since there is not a team in the world can always win.
8.0	Having access to facing failure strengthen people's ability to deal with the unhappibess when facing failure.
8.0	As a result, when one meets some difficulties in his real life, if he can recall the failure of his national team in a international competition, he will regain the courage to move on.
4.0	Aditionally, more funds in support of athletics will enhance people's sense of health.
8.0	Nowadays, people are under a great deal of pressure from their work or their study.
8.0	In order to perform better in today's intense competition, people tend to ignore their health condition and work to hard to have a rest.
8.0	If the govenment supports more sports competitions, people will be exposed to the environment that more people are discussing sports.
8.0	Therefore, more and more people will take part in sports events to build up their bodies resulting in fitness.
4.0	Admittedly, arts is likely to help people relaxed compared with sports activities by visiting art museums.
8.0	However, only people taking art courses are more likely to enjoy the beauty of art while most of people are unable to understand what the artists are trying to convey.
8.0	Conversely, sports competition is a kind of activity that everyone can enjoy.
8.0	People with less education background can also have fun seeing intense competition on the TV screen.
2.0	To put it in a nutshell, I believe government are more supposed to support athletics rather than arts because sports events not only help people to face failure but also cultivate sense of exercising, which has stronger influnce among people.
3.0	With the development of science and technology, there are increasing numbers of people watch television.
3.0	In the modern soceity, more and more cartoon were produced and it leads more young children(aged two to five) to watch television.
3.0	There is a hot topic which is whether television advertising should direct toward young children.
11.0	Some people are in favor of the idea that television advertising should direct toward young children.
11.0	However, i believe the opposite statement for the following reasons.
5.0	First of all, television advertising have negative influence on young children's eye sight.
8.0	As we all konw that, children's eye sight are developing during aged two to five and the majority of the television advertising are too light and too fast for the young children.
8.0	By contrast, all the cartoons are easy to understad and play slowly in order to fit young children's eyesight.
8.0	Let us image, if we allow television advertising directed toward young children, it seems like nothing was happen with young children.
8.0	But you will know the bad result in the future.
8.0	Thereby, watching television advertising will be a tacklein the development of young children's eyes.
5.0	Moreover, some telecision advertising will leave a negative influence on young children's mind.
8.0	There is no doubt that young children's mind have not developed well, so, they may cannot accept the big voice, violence, and so on.
8.0	For example, my brother whose name is Paddy.
8.0	When he was aged three, I watched TV with him.
8.0	At first, he was very happy about the cartoon, however, when he saw a man shot a gun in the television, he began crying.
8.0	And the the shoting of the gun was just a television advertising and these television advertising is describle a man ran with the shot in the same velocity after drinking an energy water.
8.0	Thus, soe bad television will scare the young children and leave a negative impression in their mind.
2.0	All in all, I think television advertising directed toward young children(aged two to five) should not be allowed.
3.0	Education is consolidating its status as the cornerstone to success.
3.0	However, whether it is easier to educate the children today then in the past is debatable.
3.0	Some people hold a point that it is easier to educate children in the past because at that time there was less things to distract students' attention.
10.0	As for me, I strongly believe that educating children is getting more and more easier for following reasons:
5.0	Firstly, now we have more ways for learning.
8.0	As the development of the Internet, children have various ways to study---not only by teachers' teaching,   but also by other kinds of techology such as cell phones.
8.0	Then it helps to simplize teachers work---students need not to ask their teacher every question they have, they can solve some of the tasks by looking for information online by themselves and others by discussing with their friends on social networking Website.
8.0	For example, my aunt is a teacher.
8.0	She often tells us that it is much easier to teach students today--- In the past, students ask her their all questions because it was very hard to have a tool to look up information in.
8.0	It makes her very tired and found it very difficult to educate students.
8.0	But now is totally different.
8.0	With the help of technology, students can solve most of their problems by discussing or looking up information online.
8.0	Then it enables her to  solve a few valuable question and certainly has less pressure.
5.0	Secondly, now students have more times studing.
8.0	In the past, most students' parents did not take study seriously.
8.0	They think working hard and earning money is the most important thing.
8.0	Thus, the push their children to shoulder the responsibility to do the housework.
8.0	As students' time is limited, when they spend more time working they must soend less time studying.
8.0	"Unluckily, there is an old chinese saying"" no pain no gain."""
8.0	I t means that if a person does not spend enough time studying, he would fail to succeed in all likelihood.
8.0	Then, it increases teachers' pressure because they need to devote themselves more without parents' support.
2.0	In a word, educating children is a easier task today then it was in the past considering the more time they take and the more different ways for learning.
7.0	IT is truth that a lot of parents use money or some real benefit to encourage their children to get high grade，but as a member of the student，i disagree with this method at all。
7.0	I don't want to deny that in somewhere，usually for the small kids，such kind of methods will help them to make up  there mind to do something，and encourage they to study hard and achieve somethings。But from the whole
7.0	perspective，i
7.0	disagree with it
7.0	。
7.0	At first，i think such kind of method will raised a wrong conception deep in the children‘s mind。Actually，they need to know that they are not study for a benefit purpose，they study only for themselves。If
7.0	they step into the real social system，they will find it is pretty hard to gain the real benefit by doing somethings。Just like one of my friend，he was accustomed that he will get some money or benefit by got a high mark，so
7.0	he made up his mind to got the high mark every time。but as the time
7.0	past，he
7.0	found nobody will gave him any money and benefit，even not recognize him，he felt unhappy and desperated，didn't want to study hard，So from this point
7.0	，it is not a good method at all。
7.0	and then，the kid will become materialism。This
7.0	is not an exaggerate comment，actually if every parents raised there kids like that，It will also raised a pretty bad atmosphere。The children will do something like this on purpose，not just to learn some knowledge。They want to persuade more money，in
7.0	the end，the texture of study will not so pure anymore。Another friend of my also had such experience，he
7.0	just regarded the study as a kind of jod，and got the benefit like some kind of salary。and
7.0	he didn't enjoy the study and finally he fell to have a feather education。
7.0	All at all，i think the experience of the study should be simple and pure，kids studying just for themselves，not for others。If
7.0	they regard this experience as something else，maybe in the short term，they
7.0	will success。But compare with the long term，they will lose。
3.0	How does the satisfaction come most  for  workers?
3.0	I remember one of my collegue once told me that she wanted to quit her job an receptionist in an construction company.
3.0	I wonder why, and she told me that it was just doing some similar tasks all day long like guiding the customers , arranging some meetings or appointments for leader.
3.0	it was quite bored and felt noe progress in the long future.
3.0	Though I was a little bit shocked at the first time because she got a quite acceptable salary and the job was easy for her, yet I agreed with her about shifting to some kind of jod with more tasks to do.
11.0	There are several reasons to support my ideas.
5.0	The first reason to support my idea about having many different types of tasks to do during the workday not only because of the satisfaction you get from the achievements of those tasks, but also because of the capability fo dealing with all kinds of task being improved.
8.0	In order to address the problems we may encounter during the task, one have to be pushed to improve his or her own ablilty to predict and address the concerns to make things go smoothy.
8.0	For example, it is adimited that the leaders in any companies have to cope with a lot of tasks oneday which also reflected the importance of being able to handle different tasks in one's working position.
8.0	Moreover, every employee wants to be the leader, it is definitely a way of getting satisfaction.
5.0	The second and I think it nay be  the most useful aspect of doing many types of tasks, which is having more communication opportunities with people from different sections or positions.
8.0	Doing the similar tasks everyday means one's association area is limited, while more tasks means more people you will be associated with.
8.0	Communication skills and socialism are quite important fi you want to get a better statue or being promoted in any company nowadays.
8.0	so, doing many tasks a day is quite useful for one to establish relationship with others and get negotating ability improved because one may have to deal with people with different interests or habits
1.0	In summary, workers will definitely get more satisfied by doing many types of tasks than doing similar tasks all day.
1.0	Working many tasks may even make one know more about o
3.0	Recently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated topic among people: which expenditures should be reduced by goverments during economic crisis, library, police or public transportation?
3.0	Opinions vary from person to person.
3.0	Some people claim that the spending of police or public transportation should be declined.
3.0	However, I would stand on their opposite side and I believe that the expenditures of library should be decreased.
12.0	My viewpoints can be elaborated as follows.
4.0	Firstly, library have already complete system and there is no need to put as much spending as before into the library during economic crisis.
8.0	Nowadays, a regular library have owned abundant sources of books.
8.0	If people cannot find the book which they want to read in the library, they could surf the Internet and they would get the book easily.
8.0	As for the staff which work in the library, they would not put much strain on the library budget because not many people would come to the library to read.
8.0	Thus, library could not employ many staff to work there during ecnomic crisis.
8.0	For example, our country suffered an economic crisis then years ago and our government asked half of the library in our country to close.
8.0	Then our government saved one million RMB each year which helped our country a lot at that time.
4.0	Secondly, the spending of police should not be reduced because the safety of citizen is the first aim of governments.
8.0	Only if the safety of citizen is promised, can governments to deal with the situation of economic crisis.
8.0	If the government reduce the expenditures of police, citizens would be worred about them safety.
8.0	This is not good for handling the economic crisis because the government would lose some control on public, let alone the entirly ecnomy.
4.0	Finally, the public transportation is also important for everyone especially during the ecnomic crisis.
8.0	There are lots of traffic tool that people will take.
8.0	If the spending of transportation is reduced, it would cause the mess of the transportaion and people would not work on time.
8.0	Therefore, it would influence people's life siganificantly.
2.0	All in all, I firmly think government should reduce the expenditures of library during the economic cirsis.
3.0	Have you ever bought some products you don't really need, but you bought it just because of the advertisements?
12.0	Therefore, nowadays there are increasing people have a perspective that most advertisments make products seem much more excellent than they actually are.
11.0	However, I have an opposite opinion about this.
5.0	Firstly, making produsts seem much better than they actually are mostly is not accepted by most of the companies.
8.0	Normally, the provident companies would enable the context of advertisements is simillar with the real products, because even though the products attract lots of costumers at the first time, if the quality of the products are not familliar with the customers' imagination, they would lose these costumers soon.
8.0	Last year, I heard a news that a cosmetic company were bankrupt, because of the fake advertisement.
8.0	I remembered the advertisement exaggerated the effection of the cosmetics which caught lots of costumers' eyes at the first time, however, gradually those costumers were realized that the effection are not so significant, so the company lose a large profit.
5.0	In addition, the cores of the influence of the advertisements are real.
8.0	Even though some advertisement are made up, it could be clearly discovered, which could enable the costumers to have a great impression on this advertisements.
8.0	To illustrates, I saw a piece of advertisement about chocolate, which says if you could send this chocolate for people you love, and he or she could love you and company with you forever.
8.0	Most of our costumers could realized the made up section, however, we still bought it.
8.0	Because sometimes it is just an emblem, and other people could feel the hope of us.
1.0	Admittedly, some advertisements seem much better than they really are, but they are not the most.
1.0	Those companies which can have this advertisement must have some beliefs that they could attrac
12.0	Traveling plays an important role in people's daliy life, but whether people should travel in their own country or should travel in foreign countries is still contraversial.
12.0	Some people claim that traveling in their own country will be more convinient and the consumpution will be low.
12.0	but I contend that traveling in foreign countries has a lot of  advantages  which can help the  people open up their mind and enrich their experience.
6.0	firstly, traveling in foreign coutuires can open up people's mind.
8.0	when people travel to some new places means that  they will get in touch  different people and culture, such as  beliefs, values, lifestypes and so on.
8.0	Some time they may face some challenges which will promot them to learn some new  abilities.
8.0	During this journey, people coud became tolerant to difference.
8.0	Take my cousin as an  example, my cousin was a very shy boy.
8.0	when he was at the high school, he had a very serious problem that he would be very nervous when speaking in public.
7.0	when he graduate from the high school, my uncle took to the tiland
3.0	During the study, we always have some puzzles about the things we learned in class.
3.0	We have many methods to solve this such as asking the teachers or classmates.
3.0	However, there is a controversy that when your friends is needed someone to help with his study while you always get good grades in your class, would you help your friend or let him to find a tutor?
11.0	If I were you, I should teach him by myself.
4.0	To begin with, this action can strenghen the relationship between each other.
8.0	Since you help him to solve the problem, he will be appreciate and do something to pay back such as sending agift for you or invite you to have a meal.
8.0	Take my experience for example, I am good in math and one of my classmates is not.
8.0	Once, he asked me to explain how to solve a tough question.
8.0	I try my best to interpret three method of this question and he saw it.
8.0	After that, he no longer makes any mistake about this question.
8.0	In return for my effort, he invited me to  the entertainment park to play and we build deep friendship.
4.0	Second, helping others is also an effective way to exercise our communication and expression ability.
9.0	When you explain the methods of the questions, you should interpret briefly and clearly enough and use some examples to illustrate it,so that your friend can easy to understand what you just said.
9.0	And before you start, you should have clear and effective logic in your mind so that youcan express logically.
4.0	Third, helping others with the questions is a good method to review what you learned.
8.0	Because when you teach others, you must understand  this question completely and can solve this within a short time period.
8.0	As you interpret the reason of it, you will also explain the equation and formula that used in this.
8.0	Therefore, you review this konwledge again.
8.0	As for me, I always do this and I hardly ever making mistakes in the examination about the quetion I have interpreted to my classmates.
2.0	To sum up, from my point of view, I prefer to help friend by self which has a lot of advantages.
3.0	I agree that parents should give money to their children according to their mark in the school.
3.0	The following saying will support my view.
3.0	Firstly, it can encourage the children to work harder in the school study.
3.0	Money is essential for everyone including kids, because children have something that they want to buy.
3.0	In addition, if parents offer their children money according to their mark in the school, children will be more attracted to the study to get more money.
3.0	For example, in my middle school, my mother gave me a permission that she gave me 100 yuan to buy my favourite toy if I got A grade in my final exam.
3.0	The toy is to me what fish is to water.
3.0	You can imagine how eager I am to get the toy.
3.0	I got up eveyday at 6 o'clock and have a busy list of study hour.
3.0	In the neat two monthes, I only slept only 8 hours and pay most attention to study in the school.
3.0	Finally, I got a good grade and new toy.
12.0	It can be argued that giving money to the teenagers can make them more hard-working.
6.0	Secondly, it is a good way to teach the children the way to deal with money.
8.0	For instance, my sister got monry from her mom since she was very young.
8.0	On the contrary to the common belif that parents give money to children by the request of children, her mom give her the money by her performance in the school.
8.0	So she had a clear knowing about money that should be earned by herself insteading ask parented to get.
8.0	However, my brother got the money from his father with any request of he wantted.
8.0	So he is always wasting money and havn't know the preciou meaning of money.
8.0	He often gives money to his friends without any reason and pay a lot of money for the game of Internet.
8.0	It can be concluded that the aittitude that parents deal with money can have a great influence for their children, so that parents should give monry to the kids in the correct way.
2.0	It is why I agree with the statement that students should be paid by tha
3.0	Nowadays, the high grade students get in the school is really attractive to parents so that it drives many parents to use any way possible to enhance the grade of their children in the school.
3.0	Offering their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school is a general idea to reach this goal.
3.0	And in my opinion, this is a really great idea for parents to utilize to make their children get high grades in school.
12.0	The reasons generalized below.
5.0	Firstly, children dosen't have much concious about how important the high grade they get in school means.
8.0	We rellatively older people know that high grades mean great recognization and agreement by society, which further gives us more chances to succeed in the future life.
8.0	But children always don't understand this, they love easy and funny things like playing.
8.0	If parents don't do something to inspire their children to study hard in school, many children will just play too much and be the terrible students in the school.
8.0	So ways like offering money for their children are gread things to consider for parents.
5.0	Secondly, It is a very useful way to help children to get good grades in the school.
8.0	I have an experience about this.
8.0	When I was young and was in the primary school.
8.0	I had a very good friend who was my classmates.
8.0	My mother used to offer me a little money for each high grade I get in school.
8.0	So I always had great passion studying.
8.0	Although my friend and I usually played together, he did not like studying at all.
8.0	When I asked him why he did not finish teachers' works, he said: 'It is too boring'.
8.0	However, today I just go into a pretty good college in a big city because of my good grades.
8.0	He still stays in his little village to struggle for life everyday.
8.0	So after my own experience of such idea taken by my parents, you see, it is really effective for this method for children's good grade.
1.0	Therefore I think that offering children money for each high grade they get in school is a completely great idea.
1.0	Through this way can you get you children a better grade.
7.0	And for more, a beter life
3.0	Currently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people: Are people have less happy or less satisfied with their lives than people in the pass?
3.0	Opinion vary from person to person, some people agree with this opinion.
11.0	However, from my perspective, i disagree with that people are happier and satisfier in today.
5.0	Firstly, today's entertament is more than past.
8.0	To be more specific, because the world is changing so quickly, people can play more, like the centrol part and a lot of exercise place, so they can get happy and satisfy from these kind of things.
8.0	On the contrary, in the past, the world is devolope to slow, so that the people do not have any place to play.
8.0	For example, today, we have a lot of jam in our community.
8.0	And i was a high school student, every day after school, i would feel so tired, and the best way to me to relax is go to the jam.
8.0	Because i believed that only physcial relax can make mental to be relax.
8.0	So after i finished exercise, i feeled happier and satisfier.
5.0	Secondly, diversity vedio can be a good way to get happy and satisfy.
8.0	To be more specific, in today's world, the television is devolope better, so we can watch the color and listen the music.
8.0	Therefore, we can feel happier and satisfier.
8.0	On the contrary, in the past, the television only has black and white, so people will have less feeling.
8.0	For example, when i was ten years old, teenagers always have a lot of trouble.
8.0	But every day i would watch a cartoon at 6 o'clock in the evening, and because of this cartoon was to funny, i feeled happier and satisfier.
2.0	In the conclusion, i disagree with the statement that because of the world is changing so quickly, people feel less happy and satified than in the past.
7.0	Because i beliece that
3.0	Have you ever been unwilling when your teachers or meeting leaders said something incorrect about your opinion?
3.0	What   have you done?
3.0	I have met this situation and I corrected my teacher right away.
12.0	And there are two facets why I did this right away.
6.0	Initially, I think opinion is a especially important way that transfer our altitude to the events and the opinion with wrong information may make a serious problem.
8.0	Therefore it cannot be expreed wrong and we should correct it right away when it is expreed with a wrong meaning.
8.0	For instance, my math teacher told something wrong in my opinion  of a formula.
8.0	Then I interrupted him and corrected it.
8.0	My classmates were all agree with my opinion and thought it is the best explanation of this formula.
8.0	They give me enthusiastic applouse.
8.0	However, if I did not correct it, my classmate would think I did not
10.0	Moreover, I think saying nothing will make a further misundertanding of your classmates and correcting mistakes after class will not give a immediaterly right idea to your classmates.
1.0	Even though correcting teacher's mistake will make teacher feel embarrassed, I stil think true meaning of your opinion wil stop the potential problem.
1.0	Taking account of the mentioned factors, we can safely arrive conclusion that the best way is to correct the mistake right away when teachers says something incorrect in your opinion.
3.0	Nowadays, many movies and televisions have been introduced to stimulate the industry of the entertainment.
3.0	People can relax themselves from watching them.
11.0	However, many people considered that the entertainments will be more harmful than positive for the young people.
12.0	But actually, young people can benefit a lot from these kinds of entertainments.
9.0	It's good for them to attach the movies and the televisions.
9.0	They won't be bad for the behavior of the young people.
5.0	To begin with, the movies can help release the young people from the tons of the work.
8.0	So they can feel relaxed because of the watching programs.
8.0	Young people are so busy nowadays, and also, they have the responsibility to get their work and family settled down.
8.0	What they really need to do is relax themselves through these methods.
8.0	They only feel relaxed but nothing more that he have their own time due to the movies and television.
8.0	One of my friends once told me that he is tired of the tons of the homework.
8.0	Everyday after he finished the assignments, his mother allows him to watching a movie.
8.0	And when he watched the film, he felt so happy that he get the relaxation of the entertainments.
5.0	Then, the movies and televisions can help young people with their work and life.
8.0	Except some rubbish films, most of the movies and televisions have positive meaning to the society.
8.0	Young people can learn a lot from the movies and programs about their life and work.
8.0	Once upon a time, I felt so depressed about myself and I prepared not to study anymore.
8.0	However, my sister gave me a movie of hard-working students.
8.0	The film was very good and it motivats my heart to study hard again thanks to the video.
7.0	Last but not least, movies and televisions can give us a positive feeling about the
11.0	I think i agree with the statement that parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes,  First,i think feel something by themselves can make them remember longer and deeper.
12.0	They need to fix the mistakes and find the way to make them correct,It will let them get much stronger feeling,then they may remember the mistakes for a long time and try to never make the same mistakes again.
5.0	second,when children make mistakes, they are also learning the experience.
8.0	After the mistakes they made,they will know what they can do and what they can't do more clearly.
8.0	And when thet have the idea to do the same wrong things,they will still think and remamber the result and the experience,   Third,by the process the children making mistakes, always is the process they discovering.
8.0	They can find many new things and knowledge.
8.0	It's the really important part of their life, and it has many benifits fpr then to grow up.
5.0	For my own experience, when i was in primary school, i always forget to bring my things back.
10.0	At that time i feek very sad and scared.
7.0	Surprisliy,my mother didn't blame me , she just told me i
11.0	I agree this statement.
12.0	becase I see many these things reported by newspapers in recently.
11.0	I think people who are helipful in the society not less than before with the development of the economy.
12.0	Followings are some exampples.
6.0	fist of all.
8.0	Fortnight I see a thing, which is about a young man help an old woman went through the cross road.
8.0	it is very commen to see in our surroding now.
8.0	As a result, I contend that people today are willing to help the struggling strangers in our society.
8.0	Then I will talk about another thing, which is about a man who help an old man firing in his home died from droping the high building.
8.0	I feel very bad when I see taht news.
8.0	but I think this thing can prove that we chinese are helping and like helping other people though strangers surronding us.
8.0	last but not least.
8.0	I want tto say wo should give our lovement to the society.
8.0	Only by this way can our society become better and stronger.
1.0	In conclusion.
1.0	I persist my point that people are more willing to help the struggling strangers in recently.
3.0	Financial responsibility is the sign of  adults.
11.0	In order to help childen grow to adults, should they learn how to manage their money when they are little.
11.0	Personal speaking, I think children should learn to regulate their own money.
5.0	To begin with, learning the self fincacial management is beneficial to help children build the money concept.
8.0	Mostof children never worry about how to earn money,because their parents will do every things for them and provide the best living condition for them.
8.0	Therefore children do not know how difficult to earn money.
8.0	That will cause children waste their money and form a bad consuming habitIf.
8.0	For example,children will buy a lot of foods and throw most of them in the garbage can, which waste foods and this habit is terrible to their future life.
8.0	If let children learn to manage their own money, they will know how valuable the money is, then they will cherish the money and not to waste the money.
5.0	Second, learn to manage money can help children learn how to plan their own money.
9.0	This skill is important to become a financially responsible adults.
9.0	If the parent give the money to children in the begin of the month and those money that children should use to support their own life in this month.
7.0	This situation which is very commen in the adults' lives, children should learn how to plan using they money to supor
12.0	Nothing is perfect, as the mistakes are made by human incuding children all the time.
4.0	Children are not a fully growed-up human being, so mistakes are always be made by them.
9.0	They might not even notice while they are making a mistake, and the consequence might make their parents embarrased.
9.0	As a parent, setting up a good example for their children such like being kind to them, and telling them what should not have been done, even what to do after a serious consequnce.
4.0	My personal experience could interprate the effect of being a child who was grown up in a nice enviorment.
8.0	My mother was always being tolerable to me.
8.0	She taught me how easy it is to make a mistake and correct it.
8.0	Letting me making mistakes helped me to feel comfortable, althogh learning from my mistakes was not pleasant at all.
4.0	Trying to make a mistake might sound dumb to you, but the benifit behind it is tremendous.
10.0	By makeing a mistake, parents and their children could have time to see what factors caused mistake, and what to do to slove the problem.
2.0	Despite the benifit which I learned from my mistakes, every parents should at least let their children try to make a mistake.
12.0	I agree with the idea that it's more efficient to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than have fun by doing physical exercise.
12.0	The main function of doing physical exercise is to reduce fatigue especially over body,it don't have a great influence on your spirit world.
9.0	But if you  want to have fun by  watching a movie or reading a book,you can take a marvelous trip through worlds vary from different  movies or books.
9.0	And otherwise,you can relax yourself physically.
6.0	In real life,more and more people are accustomed to the high velocity life.
8.0	And in those conditions,it will be common for them to feel tired both physically and  spiritually.
8.0	At this time ,taking a little time to  watching a movie or reading a book will satisfy your two demandings and i believe that it's a direct way to solve your true problems.
8.0	As for doing physical   exercise,you have to keep frequency in a certain extent to ease your high-light pressure.
8.0	And first,it may be difficult to fit the  high speed life,then sometimes you will feel more uncomfortable if you have used up energy.
8.0	So i suggest that you should think twice when you have to choose a way to relax yourself.
8.0	Whatever,i am not talking that you can't have to take excrcise forever,what i want to emphsize is that maybe relax by watching a movie or reading a book will be a better way than have fun by doing physical exercise.
3.0	With lifestyle's development,people's growth environment gradually becomes more and more perfect.
11.0	It means not only the material basis,but also the healthy growth of mentality are more adequate than the circumstances before with giant society resource.
11.0	Then most persons from the birth get better education.
12.0	So people  nowadays are willing to help the strangers with trouble.
4.0	However,there is a doubt that the richer people are,the more ruthless they are.
8.0	Quantities of money and power excessively thrill their minds so that they gradually lose their principel as a human.
8.0	But it seems that it is a few conditions happened to our life and these cases are still exception.
8.0	There are more successful people who is always pursuing to be a great example to all of us like MaYun.
8.0	Just a few days ago,he sold out all his treasure and use a mass to devote to charity.
8.0	Guys like him are a great amount even though they are maybe just cleaners of workers.
4.0	Admittedly,we can see many negative news everywhere,especially on the internet.
9.0	But in fact,from  a certain extent,it exaggerate the seriousty and expend the influence of the bad news rather than show us the positive news to us.
9.0	What we don't know is not equal to no existence.
4.0	People have a ordinary life with many restricts like morality and laws.
8.0	The morality make us controll our behaviour even there is a person who falls down you shouldn't just walk away.
8.0	It commend that even a stranger if he is in trouble we should try ou best to help.
8.0	And the law requests us not to just stand aside when some crimes happen in front of you with nothing you do.
1.0	Above all,People living in the  modern life get greater virtue than past society.
1.0	So there is no deny that people today are more willing to help the puzzled strangers.
11.0	These days, a discussion about if children need more time to spend on the things what they want to do.
12.0	It's important for the student to spend time to develop their own hoppies.
11.0	However, in my opinion, I do not agree with the statement that children should be given more time to do whatever they want.
12.0	Because doing homework and participating the organized activities related to school can be more suitable to them.
12.0	Moreover,Homeworks and activities organized by schoole can help them build foundamation of what they want to participate.
5.0	First, Doing homework and participating the organized activities related to school can be more suitable to children because these issuses are provided by the school, which is the profession in education.
8.0	School have abundant knowledge about make the child start easily than child do it himself.
8.0	For example,I spent more time in participating in the activities organized by school  as a hoster.
8.0	This activity made my vrigin connect with the experience and I required the advise was very useful to me at that time.
8.0	If I just started this activies not in school but in my way, I will get puzzled easily and be likely to escaped from it.
5.0	Second, Doing homework or partcipating in organized acticities related to the school also help the children to bulid the foundmation of what they want to participate.
9.0	things can start rough if the starter have no foundmation in this field, and the  homework or activities can provide the chances and matrial for children to enhence their ability.
9.0	the ability of studying and communications, which are both important for the children.
7.0	To illusrate, my friend is in favor of the mechani
3.0	In our society, people are compelled to cooprate with each others in oder to be more aggressive.
3.0	Recently, a heated debate has been aroused among people whether colleagues or classmates should communicate personally than through emails in order to work a project.
3.0	From my perspective, I firmly believe that it is better for colleagues or classmates to talk face to face.
3.0	Here are some reasons and examples that supported my viewpoints.
5.0	First, communicating with each other in person can increase the relationship and thus people are more likely to devote himself to the project.
8.0	Since people talk and exchange ideas personally, everyone can see each others' face and thus know each other's feeling.
8.0	someone who might not have passion in that project might affect by others' passional talking.
8.0	Therefore, the team is in a good and active atmosphere which everyone is willing to do his own work perfectly.
8.0	But if people talk through emails, people cannot see other's face and cannot know each other's feeling, resulting a bad mood in the team.
8.0	For instance, when I was in a project needed three people, I firstly suggest that we should find a nice place and share our own viewpoints freely.
8.0	Everyone agrees with that and we finally make a wonderful talk even including our own life, our experience recently and our novels or movies we read.
8.0	At last, everyone finish his own work perfectly, and we get a good grade due to the success of the project.
5.0	Second, it is more precise for people to communicate personally so the project can be continued soomthly.
8.0	Since people talk to each other in person, they have lots of time to express their idea or demand precisely.
8.0	With less mistakes, people can do a better job in the project, leading a good result.
8.0	In the constrast, people have to type their emails and might make mistakes when typing.
8.0	Moreover, the people who read the emails might misunderstand the context in the emails and they might not find they are wrong, which cause great difficults for project to continue.
8.0	For instance, when I was in a project I do not had time to meet the colleagues so I send him a email annoucing him some details in our peoject.
8.0	He seemed misunderstand some information such as the demand for the project.
8.0	Finally, we do not finish our project before deadline.
7.0	To put it into a nutshell, I firmly believe that it is better for colleagues or classmates to communicate
12.0	There are lots of people think that it is batter to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.
8.0	But I don't agree this.
8.0	I think doing some sports like playing foootball or basketball are better than sitting in front of the computer or TV to relax.
8.0	Sitting in front of the computer or the table by a long time is not good for your health.
8.0	It will make your eyes and your spine fell tired and ache.
8.0	And sitting motionless will make you easier to be fat.
8.0	But phusical exercise can make you get real rest and it will make your body stronger and healthier.
8.0	All in all,doing physical exercise is good for your body and your mind.
8.0	And it can make you get real relax.
8.0	But reading or watching only can make your mind relax and it will make your body tired out.
8.0	So if I choose a way to relax,that I will cho
3.0	As is know to all, books and movies tend to show an individual's life outlook and their hobbits.
11.0	Therefore, somoe people believe that books and movies can help us to learn a person.
12.0	However, the others holds that there is  no clear relationship between the book and the mind of people.
11.0	As far as I'm concerned, I will go for the former idea for several resons.
5.0	First of all, the book or a movie one are crazy for will show their backgrounds.
8.0	There is no denying that we are accustomed to read the book or watch the movie in the feilds that we are familiar with.
8.0	Since the  nature of human, we tend to avoid the unknown parts in oir life, we may unconsciously be prone to the books which telling  stories similiar to our childhood, adolescent, as well as working experience before.
8.0	It always makes me feel moved when I watch a movies based on my hometown.
8.0	In addition, the knowledge that we are mastered are also determin what we will read or watch.
8.0	Take one of the movie I watched before as a typical example about a murder, the police caught the killer due to the math book that he always read.
8.0	It is hard for killer to avoid expressing any of his mind in the book he read.
5.0	Moreover,  it is the book or the movie that people tent to go for that indicate their dreams.
8.0	People have to probe the world to acheive their dream with the aid of the books and movies.
8.0	They imagine the future through the movies and enrich their soul via books.
8.0	For example, in order to be an iternational studetn, I have to learn TOEFL in advance; therefore, the reference book that I used show my goals in the future.
8.0	The same goes for every individual in our daily life.
8.0	They can never arrive at the summit of the dreams   Taking into all the accounts that mentioned above, we can arrive at the conclusion easily that the books and the movies that one like indeed help us to learn them.
8.0	Not only will we learn their possible background, but also their goals and dreams.
12.0	I think it is a good way to inprove children's interest in study,because this can encourage children to study hard and have more confidence.
12.0	First of all,it is a very important way to help children to build up a attitude to study hard.
12.0	If we do not do this,they may be think study hard is no use because it can not have some awards ,such as money,games and so on.
5.0	What's more,when we award they some money ,they listen to their parents ,and have more time study in their parents' plan,otherewise they will not listen to their parents ,and take the temper to their parents when their parents require them to study.
5.0	Next, it is also important that their parents give their some money when the get good grade ,they can have more confidence on study ,in this way,they can study hard and become better and better in the future.
10.0	Last but not least,when parents use this way to award their children,they can ha   All in all,I think it is very useful to award children some money when they get good grade.
3.0	With the development of economy and society, tourism has become an emerging industry.
3.0	Then a problem has attracted public attention that what should government do to attract tourists.
3.0	Some people claim that hiring more police to improve the safety.
3.0	However, my perspective is improving the traditional buildings and stressts to improve the appearance.
11.0	And my reasons are as follows.
5.0	To begin with, prevent repairing old building is beneficial to traditional culture protection, and the unique culture is the most attractive thing for tourists.
8.0	Some traditional buildings were constructed in ancient age and have remained the old appearance of that time, which have much historical value.
8.0	Tourist especially foeigners are curious to the remains.
8.0	On the contrary, if the old buildings are preserved badly, nobody want to visit the spot.
5.0	Secondly, hiring more police means more cost which will be a burden for the government and cannot led to an evident improvement to tourism.
8.0	Attendlly.
8.0	more police will make society more safety, which is important for tourism.
8.0	But there are other more effective things to improve the safety, such as making laws or improving education.
8.0	And these measure will be benificial in later time.
11.0	When it comes to the question wether it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading than relax by doing physical exercise, there is always many  disputes.
11.0	In my opinion, this statement is not entirely right.
12.0	The answer varies with the different peoplr , different time and so on.
5.0	For example, to those who likes physic  very much and do not like reading, It is more relaxing for him to do some physical exercise than to read a book.
9.0	However, to a reading-liker,a movie-liker or a writer, a movie or a nice book can be the best medicine for their exhoust.
9.0	In this case, the result is different because the different hobbies different peoplr have.
5.0	In another occassion, it varies because of the different experiences.
8.0	We can assume that there is a person who have taken an important exam right now and a person who have just taken a music course, there is no denying that they have different answer to this question.
8.0	In this case, people have the entirely differentexperiences right now.
8.0	Of course, they have the dispute.
2.0	From the teo examples above, we can see clearly that that statement is not so good.
8.0	It do not take different cases into consideration.
8.0	Any opinion we want to convince others of, we shoud see to it that it is right on all occassions.
8.0	Obviously, this statement do not meet this .
8.0	So in my opinion, it is not necessary better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.
8.0	In different cases, we may think the entirely contrast statement is right.
8.0	Every time we are tired, we may have different feelings.
8.0	then we should think carefully what we need most and only in this way can we relax and feel more better.
8.0	So i think it is wrong.
12.0	As the world is developing at a fast pace, many children can get in touch with technology earlier than children in the past.
12.0	Although technology can bring benefits to human, many people are concerning whether the techonology has made children less creative than they were in the past.
12.0	As far as I am concerned, technology didn't make children less creative than they were in the past.
4.0	To begin with, technology can provide children with a series of tools to access information that they need to create.
8.0	With the wild spread of electonic devices, children may use the computers, pads, and smart phones to get information.
8.0	In this way, they will have more ways than they were in the past to learn by themselves.
8.0	As far as they learned a certain amount of knowledge, they can have a lot of ideas easily.
8.0	Also, with the ideas and information, they can create something by themselves.
8.0	On the contrary, children in the past get less information than children now, so it can be difficult for them to be more creative than children with more ideas and information.
4.0	Then, technology can help children create things easiser.
8.0	With technology, children can save a lot of time and energy that children used to spend on constructing.
8.0	In the past, if children want to create something, then they have to find materials and make them all by themselves.
8.0	However, children now can just find a machine to automatically create the things they want.
8.0	In this way, they will not give up create things easily.
8.0	For example, my brother likes car a lot, and last summer he came up with a creative idea to build a toy car that can be fold into a suitcase.
8.0	And he made the components with the 3D printer, and finally he did it.
8.0	Ever since then, he has a sense of achievement, and couldn't help coming up with more creative ideas.
8.0	So technology can also cultivate children to be creative.
4.0	Last but not the least, I admit that children can rely on and be distracted by technology sometimes, because they are too young to control themselves.
8.0	However, parents can help to control them.
8.0	And In another word, just because the existance of technology that children can get in touch with so many things they are interested in, and learn them in a fast and interesting way.
8.0	Just because of this, that children are willing to study the things they are curious about by themselves and try to create their own things.
1.0	To conclude, I don't think technology has made children less creative than they were in the past.
1.0	If the development of technology limited childrens' development, then why people are continuing develop technology?
3.0	Nowadays, in many schools, there are two different types of ways to study, on is study in a group, and the other is study alone.
3.0	And there are advantages with both study ways.
11.0	But, some people believed that students will be more effective when they are study alone, because they can be participate more on their recent project.
11.0	However, in my opinion, I suggeat that students would be more effective while they are study in a group.
11.0	Because it will be more efficient.
10.0	And some reasons to support.
4.0	First of all, students will be more effective when they are study in agroup.
8.0	Because when teacher gives a project to students, there must be lots of work to do, so students in the study group can divide the task in servral parts for each people.
8.0	So they can concentrate on their own work.
8.0	Compare to study alone, a single student have a limit capacity of study, so they can't do a lot of work as a group can.
8.0	In addition, it also can develop student's ability fo teamwork.
8.0	In the group, every one needs to work perfectly with their onw part, so that the whole group won't be disorder.
4.0	Second, in the study group, when a student is facing a diffcult problem, rest of the group members caould help him to solve the answer.
8.0	In the group, every one helps with each other, they can solve the problems correctly without cost lots of time.
8.0	But if  a single person faces with a problem, no one could help him.
8.0	I have experienced a group work when I was in primary school.
8.0	Once in the math class, teacher gave us a project.
8.0	And soon some student who are confidetn they work alone, I work with my friends.
8.0	When the results came, our score was much higher that single people.
4.0	Third,although I admit that work alone can be more focus on their project without distraction, but work in a group can develop people's avility of creative thinking.
9.0	When students are taslking with each other, they mix up with different thinkingso that can develop student's mind.
9.0	They can be more creative than they was.
2.0	In conclusion, I agree with the statement that students work in a group, because it can be more effective, and it also can develop student's creative thinking.
12.0	Resontly, some education methods has become a heated discution, when people talk about weather should let the students who learn much more effectively than when they are asked to work alone on projects, must work together when teachers assign projects, there is a contraversal debate.
12.0	Some people think they shouldn't work with others because they do alone works better, but I think maybe let those students be with their classmates is the best choise.
5.0	First, when we talk about study, well, I think it's not just to study on those books.
8.0	Students study from eachother is a better way to take knowleage also beyound knowleage which come from book aswell.
8.0	Thus, study the mortality from others, learn some thing we use in our daily life.
8.0	In a group, they can study how to deal with same thing from different way, so, here we don't talk about the effeciency, I think we should see though this question from the other angle.
5.0	Second, prictice social skill is very important after they graduated.
8.0	We all live in a big sociaty, to be alone isn't a logic way to survive in any part of this world.
8.0	We need friends, that help our mintal keep in healthy, isolated from other people may cause some series problem, So that important to make friends in school.
8.0	How to make friends as I expect, also should be what we have to study in school too.
2.0	For summery, work together sometime can be benifit on varied way.
8.0	Not only to see how the grade become after study, we should focus on how to make all students become a healty also wholy person.
8.0	Build up better personalty, so, that can be the real good education.
8.0	Grade aways come second, how to live better life on their own, that is the frist thing came all the matters.
11.0	From my point of view,I agree with this statement.
11.0	To be more specific,I would like to give following reasons.
12.0	In the first place,if students work together they can learn from each other because everyone has their own advantages,they can get some useful experience.
12.0	What is more,it may brings about some amazing ideas when students sit togethrt to discuss something.
12.0	If students work alone these can not be achieved.
5.0	In the second place,when students make mistakes,if they work with other people,others may point out,they are not in a wrong way.
8.0	They may never make this mistake again.
8.0	Taking myself for example,last weekd,i could not work out a math problem,i checked again and again,but i still did not why.
8.0	Then my classmate came to see my homework,she told me the second figure i wrote was wrong.
5.0	Last but not least,if students work togerher everyone will have their own work to do,not noly does it saves time but also saves energy.
10.0	They can do better at their work and more specilized.
2.0	There are many Chinese old sayings and theories can prove this statement.
3.0	Nowadays,it is quiet common that parents do not have enough to spend on their children who stay at home alone.
3.0	The only way yher can accompany their kids is to squeeze the free time from their busy schedule.
3.0	By means of utilizing this dtime, some people prefer to play with their children ,while others tend to do things about homework.
12.0	From my point of view, if yhe time is limited, playing with their kids is a better way to get along thier kids.
5.0	First, playing, an important part of a kid , can substantially better the relationship between parents and children.
9.0	Everyone knows that kids are much for playing games.
9.0	Therefore, under the situation that parents do not have enoujgh time to spend on their children, doing what the kids like to do is of great significance.
5.0	In addition, schoolwork has already occpied most of a kids time in a day, in my country, children are required to go to school at seven thirty in the monrning and leave their school after five in the afternoon.
8.0	Furthermore, some students may go to supplement school from six to eleven in the evening.
8.0	Hence, parents should not spend time with their children relatd to schoolwork.
8.0	After being exposed to the schoolwork all day along, children are admottedly weary of it.
8.0	So parents have no time know more things about education after school.
1.0	In a word, in this busy society, it is difficult for parents to take a great deal of time to get along with their children.
1.0	Once they have time, they should play with them rather than keep teaching them about the schoolwork.
3.0	Nowadays people have many pressure, they may be the work stress, the peel stress, sometimes the sterss will come from your parents, sucn as marry or buy the house.
3.0	So when we chose our work we have better chose the woek which can satisfied you.
3.0	Here are the problem, do you like the work task that have many types, or the tasks have only one type.
11.0	Foe  me, I like the later one.
12.0	Here are my reasons.
5.0	First,if our work have only one type, we can concentrate on it.
8.0	Then it will be very quick to finish the work.
8.0	A lot of work means a lot of change , but we have to adapt the change and take some time to let us focus on the work.
8.0	For example, when I was in high school I have a lot of homework to do.
8.0	Such as math ,the biology, the history and so on .
8.0	During the summer holiday, I would take 10 days to do math and 10 days to do biology.
8.0	In a period  of the time, everyday I do the same task.
8.0	And it  is very effencieny.
8.0	Ican save a lot of time then go out to play.
8.0	But some of my classmates do the different homework everyday they hanve no time to play  because they do their work in a slow pace.
8.0	It is a way to  Second, if we do they same work for a day we will be very relax.
8.0	It means that we need not to think a lot about our work.
8.0	For example once I have a part time job, my job was typing.
8.0	Although the work is a very boring work.
8.0	But is very easy, I need not to use my brain.
8.0	And just typing.
8.0	My friend participated the job too.
8.0	But her work was making the graph  and the PPT.
8.0	Sshe have to do this two work in a day.
8.0	She always fell very tired, because she had to think a lot about the work.
8.0	And also cannot concentrate on one problem.
8.0	It means that work with the same task maje us feel realx.
5.0	Third, doing many different types of the tasks will made people feel not happy.
8.0	When we do out works ,we will face some problems that we cannot solve.
8.0	And different types of the work have the dfferent problems.
8.0	So we will loose the confidence about our work, because we cannot figure out so much problem.
1.0	So, from my perspective, I prefer doing the same tasks when we work.
1.0	We will feel more comfortable when we do this.
3.0	everyone must will make mistakes.
11.0	then we should learn from their own mistakes.
12.0	so i think the parents should allow children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.
11.0	i think no matter how much we want to help children , they need to have solve the problem from themself.
4.0	firstly, mistake allow us realize our disadvantage thus we are able to imrove us.
8.0	although mistake makes us experience disapointment , we can still learn important lessons from our mistake.
8.0	for example, last time i took the toefl test.
8.0	and it is not very good scores, i'm so disapointment.
8.0	but i konw my listening and speaking are my wakenesses.
8.0	so in the proseses, i'm really hard to improve my speaking and listening skills.
8.0	and then i think this time i can take a good grad.
8.0	if you fail, and just give it up.
8.0	it will never have a goog grad.
4.0	secondly, if parents tell child everything about what they should do and do what.
9.0	the child can not solve promblem from themself.
9.0	so parents should permit their children make mistake which might culture them to become more and more mature.
4.0	finally, some mistake should be prevented such as take drug.
9.0	because they might lead to children towards crimes and have bed effect on their life.
9.0	definitely their parents should be responsible for their children to avoid mistake.
1.0	in summerize, after taking what i have mentioned above, i can safely draw the conclusion that parents should allow their children to make their mistake and also learn siginificant things from their failures.
1.0	only this way can help them to be a succes adluts.
12.0	For me,  I think teenagers are allow to make mistake.
8.0	What parents should care about is what  youngers learn from after they makes mistakes.
8.0	As a child,he or she will face with lots of problems in their study and live,just like how to handle wthe mistake they made in curriculum,how to make friends in school,and keep this relationship.....
8.0	Because of the young age,students can not do anything as what their parents expect to.
6.0	There also have advantages children can gain from the mistakes.
8.0	Firstly,youngers can pay attention to the error they once made,and it can make them more carefully when faced with  familiar problems.
8.0	You know,fallier is the best way to make success because of the can learn a leasson in  the mistakes.
8.0	Furthen more,it's also very vital for individuals have the quality of persistance.
8.0	After they make mistakes,their are  eager to make success extremly, which stimulate their will,so when they suffer from problems,it more likely to compete with the problem rather than give up.
8.0	Last but not least,parents should have correct measures to teach their chid.
8.0	Encourage their chid to correct their mistake rather than give up are benificial to
11.0	I agree with the idea that governments should spend more money in support in the arts than in support of athletics .
5.0	First of all,art is a way to reflect the drips and draps of our life,it is a symbol of our culture , the main way to show people after hundreds of years what does our society like.
9.0	Governments should spend more money on art because people now do not mention that the importance of use artworks to record our culture and history .
9.0	And the artists now have a hard life because no one wants tyo buy their works and people can not understand their meanings in the works,so they need help to spread their spirits in the artworks.
5.0	And in the other side,athletics  is now  very popular among  people who live in cities, especially in young people.
8.0	"They are passionate to spend time and money on their favourite football team,basketball team ,and they called themselves""sport fans"",which is the artist can never imagine."
8.0	The famous athletes now can earn millions,even billions of dollars a year,and the athletics have a really good market that can earn lots of money every day.
8.0	they do not need government support,they have already got very good environment to develop their sport culture.
2.0	So athletics and arts are both important to us,but people nowadays usually forget the importance of art.
8.0	So the result is art can not develop as quick as they have done before,so we can not have such amazing artworks that the impressionism,cubism have just created.
8.0	THe government  need to provide a chance for artists , and let art that carried our culture have oppotunity to show themseves to us.
8.0	So the governments should spend more money in support of the arts than in support of athletics,the artists need more chance.
11.0	Some people in society think that watching a movie or reading a book is better than relax through doing physical exercise.
12.0	However,I have a different idea.
12.0	When it comes to the statement that playing sports is more helpful for people to relieve stress than sitting in front of TV or computers,I strongly agree.
11.0	There are some reasons why I feel this way:exercise not only contributes to relaxing brains but also is able to help ease body.
5.0	First of all,playing sports is so much the better than watching a movie or reading a book because during which time people can empty their brains and stop thinking.
8.0	In any sphere of life,people have to keep considering many kinds of issues like schools,jobs ,families and so on.
8.0	Howerer,while playing sports,people can follow their body,doing whatever they want without thinking.
8.0	In contrast, watching a movie or reading a book plays no part in this situation.
8.0	Although they can help people stay away from vexed issues in reality,people still have to think over things in virtual world.
5.0	In addition,doing physical exercise is more helpful for relaxing body.
8.0	People will sweat while they play sports which may help their bodies expel toxins.
8.0	Meanwhile,by means of running,jumping and stretching while playing sports can ease their muscle which are conductive to avoid some body diseases such as cervical spondylosis and so on.
8.0	Nevertheless,we have to keep one posture when we choose to watch a movie or read a book.
8.0	Therefore,our bodies can not relax at all!
1.0	In summary,doing physical exercise are absolutely essential in order to relax not only our brains but also our bodies.
1.0	For these three reasons,I agree with the statement that doing physical exercise is better than relax by watching a movie or reading a book.
3.0	As far as I am concerned, It's a good idea to offer the children money if they get a good grade in school.
12.0	It has a lot of advantages.
12.0	Some of my views are listed as follows.
5.0	Firstly, if children get the money from thier parents, they will be more positive to study at school in order to get a better grade.
8.0	In a way it can make students study better and get more knwledge, and they will enter a excellent university in the future, they will get a better chance to get a well offer of some famous companies.
8.0	Take my brother for example, he behaved   not well when he first enter the school, his parents were so worried about him that they gave him money as prasie if he completed anything well.
8.0	From then on, my brother behaved better and better, and gradually he formed a habit of studying by himself, finally he entered a famous university of China.
5.0	Secondly, it is a good way to fabricate a thought that if you study hard, you can earn more money in the future.
8.0	Only in this way can children form a definition of money, they will hold the view that if you want to earn money, you must spend time on your study, which is helpful to their future.
8.0	Otherwise, they can't change their mind once leave school to the society.
8.0	Besides, the colleges are in favor of this, so each college set scholarship for those behave well at school.
10.0	Lastly but not the least, it will emphasize the social duty and sense of honor by giving them money if they get good grades, they will work harder to win the honor belong to him.
2.0	On the other hand, parents shouldn't give the children much money,because they may use them to do something wrong.
12.0	Workers are more satisfied when they have many different types of tasks to do during the workday than when they do similar tasks all day long.
12.0	Here follows what I impose to confirm my point.
4.0	In the first order, having many different types of  tasks has the chance of enhancing the efficieny of work.
8.0	For an example, if you have made a speech and plan to work out a science research, you will find you are using the diverse functions of your brain.
8.0	This transition between diverse capacities of brain makes the brain works efficiently, which is because that the brain can only function in a certain way with high efficiency for a short time.
8.0	So there is no doubt that people can get more sence of achievement when they have diverse tasks.
4.0	Secondly, it is apparent that the high diversity of  tasks brings the interests to the work that may be boring before.
8.0	When you work on a certain task for a long time, it is inevitable that you will feel frustrated and bored and then you may lose your interests in the task.
8.0	When you have finished a task, you will find motivation as long as a new task occures to your brain.
8.0	When I prepared for the college entrance exam, I would fall asleep if I have worked for a subject for a long time.
8.0	So I compelled myself to change to another subject after a hour thus obtaining the motivation of  working in succession.
4.0	Last but not least, during the work on different types pf work, workers can feel that their diverse capacibilities has the chance of developing.
9.0	For example, people develop their capacibility of speeking and responsing in the public, and develop their capcaibility of writing and composing during writing some essays.
9.0	People can feel better during  this.
10.0	Th
11.0	As we all know, more and more people should relax themselves because of the presure.
11.0	Apparently, I think that people should doing more exrcise than watching a moive or reading.
11.0	So, there are three reasons to support my view.
4.0	Firstly,doing physical exercise can help people healthy.
8.0	Nowadays, people have so much presure that they often not feel good.
8.0	If someone do some exercise,such as walking,swimming,and so on, he will has health.
8.0	Then, he can has more time to do work and make more money.
4.0	Secondly,watching a movie or rading a book will harm to people's eyes.
9.0	For example, a man watch movies and read books which should use his eyes to see.
9.0	So it's  tired to their eyes and it can't help people relax themselve really
4.0	Thirdly, doing exercise can teach  people inspited .
9.0	When you doing exercise you should often doing it ,then you can get some efford .
9.0	But when you watching movies and read books , you maybe want to laugh .
2.0	Judging from all the reasons listal above,It's not better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise, so people should do more exercise to relax themselves.
10.0	As a chinese saying goes, ''More e
12.0	To begin with, students can separate the assignment into small parts and allocate each if them to every group member, a case in which students can figure out the projects more easily.
10.0	Arecent experiment conducted by Harvard University has revealed an astonishing fact that given the same research projects, designing a computer program students who worked with team did a better job and spent at least two times less than ones who were alone.
12.0	Accordingly, it is obvios that students can accomplish the school tasks more efficiently.
6.0	In addition, working with others makes it possible for students to learn from others, thereby correcting their bad habits and also cultivating their team spirit which is beneficial to their future development.
8.0	To be more detailed, we all knowthat there must be a good example among three people, which is a proverb in my country.
8.0	Inother words, even if someone is not good, we can still learn a lot form others in other fields and to improve ourselves.
8.0	Ican take myself as an example.
8.0	Actually, my best friend, Ming is good at biology which is a nightmare for me, though I always get a good performance on other coures.
8.0	I did try a lot improve my biology score by myself, nevertheless all my efforts are in vain.
8.0	Until our biology teacher implements a new study method, study group.
8.0	fortunately I realized my own wrong study pattern and got an ideal result at last.
10.0	To sum up, studing ingroup is really a great way for stuents to improve their grades and hence their effectivencess.
3.0	In the very beginning,parents use the way to express their encourage of children's hard work,but with the method becoming common,things would change.
3.0	This kind of award is based on a belief that both parents and children are honest and responsble.
3.0	For parents,they should make the rule clear,like what grade is the average or how extra grade is rewarded.
3.0	And for children,who might not understand the importance,they should promise every grade they give to parents is true.
3.0	If the requirements mentioned are not all satisfied,things could be a mutual cheat between parents and children.
12.0	Worse,children might get the bad habit of cheatng in order to get the little award from adults.
6.0	But I don't think that using awarding is a bad idea to help children improve,this may even increase their interest in study.
8.0	But parents should find the best way of awarding.
8.0	For example,the award could be other things,such as a big meal whith parents or a tool if child had a 90 grades for 5 times.
8.0	And there could be some punishment rule:if the child fail,he or she must help parents do the laundry or clean the bathroom for a week.
8.0	I think there is no much advantage to connect grade to money for children.
2.0	I have seen many families in this condition:the parents are very generous in giving money to little chid,but the child hate study and fail every important exam,then their parents would be angry and stop giving money to punish them.
8.0	The fact is,there is rarely a kid would work hard to gain their money from parents.
8.0	"So I guess the point in the ""awarding money for high grade"" is the interaction between children and parents rather than the amout of money awarded."
8.0	Maybe the most effective way to improve grade is to spend more time to be with kids and family,I think.
12.0	Nowadays many people think that money is detrimental to children's development because too much extra money may lead their kids lost in this colorful world.
11.0	I agree that money may have some negative influence to some extent.
12.0	After all, many playboys are always showing off or comparing with others.
10.0	However, in my opinion, I still think offering suitable money to kids for their good marks is beneficial.
5.0	To begin with, kids are under too much pressure these days for the restless homework, difficult exams, and targets set by others.
8.0	They probably feel exausted during the limitless studying period.
8.0	So the reward is needed, which may facilitate children to study in delight and encourage them to achieve higher achievements.
8.0	My little brother, Johnson is totally agrees on that.
8.0	He is a primary school student.
8.0	Every weekend he will have a test from school, that sounds boring, right?
8.0	However, when I asked him whether he felt tired due to this pressful test schedual, his answer completely surprised my.
8.0	He said that he was desirable for each test because his mother told him that he would get an extra pocket money if he achieved some goals in tasks.
8.0	After that he can use that money to do whatever he likes.
8.0	As a matter of that, money can also beneficial to children's study.
5.0	Besides, rewarding money to kids is also educational.
8.0	This method can teach them the difficulties of earning money.
8.0	By reaching the high grade, students must concentrate more on class and pay more painstaking effort to learn the knowledge.
8.0	During this period the children will figure out how hard their parents earning money will be, and moreover, they will become more mature as well as more cherishing in money.
8.0	Bill Gates, is the best people can reflect on this.
8.0	During his childhood, his father just designed a rewarding mechanism on him, so every time Bill would study much harder to get the awards.
8.0	After years when Bill retrospected, he said that it was his father told him how hard to earn money and taught him to value every dollar.
2.0	In conclusion,  whereas there is still an argument for not rewarding money due to high grades to children, namely worries upon the money might lead them into astrays, encouragement, coupled with educational aspects, makes a strong case of supporting rewarding money to kids.
12.0	I don't agree with the following statement.
8.0	From my personal view I think this questions should base on either mental relaxation or body relaxation.
8.0	If we pick body relaxation, I agree that is better to relax by either watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.
8.0	The premise of body relaxation is not to tiring your body.
8.0	Watching a movie or reading a book is like bring a peace to your body- not doing physical things, so it successful keep your body in a quitely shape.
8.0	Also the enjoyment of watching a movie or reading a book will bring your mind into a hearty situation.
8.0	Now talking about mind let's move on to mental relaxation.
8.0	I would like to play tennis or soccer rather tnan watching a movie or reading a book.
8.0	All the mental pressures are most from academic, so when I'm doing sports it released all the troubles from my mind.
8.0	Because when you doing things that you like to do you will dedinitely enjoy it, when you enjoy somethings then all the worries will get behind.
8.0	But it really depends, like watching a movie or reading a book just can not relax some people.
8.0	They will get frustrated from viewing all the words or staring at the scream, those kind of people will not get relaxation from doing that.
8.0	On the other hand there are also some people will never get relaxation by doing physical exercise.
8.0	Those people weren't born for sports, they extremely hate it.
8.0	They won't enjoying the pleasure the sports give to them, all they can taste from it is fatigue, it will do them no good.
8.0	People all have their own way to relax, appropriate relaxation will keep you a great shape in life.
11.0	With the development of our society, there are more and more chances for the people to enjoy the life, which contibutes much for us to living the modern society that full of pressure and intensity.
11.0	And the ways of relaxing varies from person to person.
12.0	Some of us prefer a quiet way such as watching a movie or reading a book than doing physical exercise while others have a opposal opinion.
12.0	As far as I am concerned.
10.0	I prefer the former way for the following reasons.
4.0	First and foremost, I got injured few years in the table tennis training so my physical condition is not aloowed me to do too much exercies, so, I think it is better for me to do something not  so active to spend my free time.
8.0	And now I am interested in watching movies andI can  forget  all thoes things related to failure and sadness.
8.0	And when there are no good movies for me to watch, I will read books.
8.0	As a movie fan it is of great pleasure to read thoes books which movies are baesd on.
4.0	Second, after doing physical exercise, moat of us will be tired and only want to sleep, And sometimes we may fall sleep during the dat time.
8.0	I think it is very annoying because we have a lot of wark to deal with during the day time.
8.0	Sometines doing exercies simply makes the caes wrose.
8.0	Also we can read books or watch movies whenever we are free, it is apperently a more efficient way to relax.
4.0	In the end, some exercies need money on the equipments or the place.
9.0	Take one of my roommates as an example, he is in fond of playing badminton, but in my university you have to pay 20 yuan each hour for the gym, and the proce will be doubled during the vacation.
9.0	Compred to him, my haooies cost me much little.
2.0	From what have benn mention above it is not hard to find out the better way to relax is watching movies and reading books.
3.0	Issues related to studying have never failed to attact people's attention.
3.0	When it comes to the compulsory courses, recently a hotly dabated topic has aroused among the public: whether the students should be required to take history coursed whatever their major is.
11.0	Some may insist that learning the history is neccessary, so the history class should be required.
11.0	However, as far as I am concerned, I believe that the studetns who are not in the field of history should not take the course.
12.0	My points of views will be illustrated as follow.
5.0	First of all, requiring the students to take the history couses, to some extent, is wasting their time to focus on what they like.
8.0	To be specific, in university, studetns are busy with a lot of stuffs, not only learning but also something they are intrested in.
8.0	However, the history courses take a long-term learning period for students to pay their attention to and besides, studetns have to spend a lot of time to memory and review in order to get a good grade due to its difficulty.
8.0	As a result, they lose the time and opportunity to choose the elective courses or take part in some activities they like, which waste their time to enjoy the happy university life.
8.0	For instance, when I was a freshman in university, I had intended to choose the psychology as my selective course because of my interests, however, my school required us to take the history class which time conflicted to the psychology's.
8.0	Therefore I had to give up to learn it during the first year, which really waste my time to do something I like.
5.0	On top of that, for those who are not interested in the hisory students, the course is useless.
8.0	In details, the sudents who do not like the subject will not take efforts on it, which means that during the class they will not follw the teacher's teaching but finish their own work.
8.0	And after the class, they will not seriously finish the homework and they will not prepare well for the test but just pass it.
8.0	As a result, opening the course cannot reach the original intention, because many students who do not like the course will not learn it hard and they cannot aquire much knowledge from the course.
8.0	For example, my uncle is a headmaster of a university.
8.0	Last year he implemented the requirment of taking history courses to his school.
8.0	However, after one year, the results is that rare students really did well in the final tests.
8.0	And after investigating, he found that few studetns were familiar with what the teacher had taught during the class, which means the courses were useless.
2.0	All in all, judging from all above, I strongly disagree that the university should require all the students to take the history class.
3.0	Nowadays, as the leval of life grows up, more and more people become learn to enjoy life.
12.0	So there is a controversial topic that whether the government should enhance the safety by employing more police to attract tourists.
12.0	I hold the view that this strategy is unreliable and ridiculous.
5.0	First and foremost, to much police can enhance tourists' pressure they will do not want to travel there again and persuad their friends not to go there.
8.0	This is because when people come to a place where many police walk around the tourist, they feel be supervised and that they should take care of their manners and behaviors every minutes.
8.0	In this case, it is difficult for them to focus on the interesting sites or interests in that place and feel nervous and stressful.
8.0	On the opposit side, if there are less force here, they can enjoy the delicious food freely and relaxedly.
8.0	For example, last summary, we had a trp to Beijing, the palace.
8.0	But in the Tiananmen Square, there are many militory here.
8.0	Even though the force just stood without any word, we still feel unfreely, which constrained our manners and communicate loudly.
8.0	So our good mood could be nagatively affected in some degree.
8.0	So I do not want to go here again anymore, even if there truley much interesting cultural exterience.
8.0	Less police can attract tourists.
5.0	Secondly, more police may indicates that palce is not saftey which can make many people do not dare to go there.
8.0	This is because a absolute safe play do not need so much police to maintain.
8.0	In this case, many people may guess that many dangerious accidents covered by the businessman.
8.0	On contrast, if there less police, people will believe that the place is so safe that thay do not need many police.
8.0	For instance, last time, when we decided to go to Zhang Jiajie to see the streams and walk the glass bridge.
8.0	But when we watched the ads on TV, that the security became more strictly than last year.
8.0	We cannot bring foods and drinks.
8.0	We must be checked very strictly.
8.0	So we do not want to go because of not believ
2.0	To sum up, I do not agree with to employ more police for ensure tourists' safety to attract tourists.
11.0	In contemporary society, people usually have to do several things at the same time in order to keep the pace of life.
11.0	Recently, there is a heated debate about whether people can do few things well since they always do many different things.
11.0	Some  people believe that it is possible to do  a good job as well as finishing many different tasks.
11.0	However, I considered that it is a useless way to raise one's woking efficiency.
6.0	In the first place, what is the most important factor of work is the quality you make, and doing one thing at a time is the key to it.
8.0	Only a person concentrate all hish attention to complete the tasks, could he or she do a good jon, since distraction is the biggest block for a person to do a good job.
8.0	Here's an example of my own experience.
8.0	Last summer vacation, I decied to finish all my work in a week and have fun in the rest part of the vacation.
8.0	However, my firend Max disagreed with my plan, saying that she would do a small part of her work each day and complete them in a month.
8.0	In order to finish all the assignment quicklier, I chose to do two tasks together, like I would do some listening about Roman history while solving some mathematic problems, staying up late to finish them, while Max do every thing well- organized her time, she studied for 4 hous each day and only do one thing at a time to assure the quality.
8.0	As a result, in this semester, Max was praised for her excellent homework.
8.0	However, I had to rewrite two lectures.
8.0	Needless to say, had it not been for doing so many things at a time, I would have not to rewrite my assignment for its low quality.
10.0	Futhermore, efforts of an assignment is the
3.0	Have you ever gone through a situation in which your address was interrupted ?
3.0	Or Have you ever stopped others' speech in the middle of a conference?
3.0	The thing is we all go through these kinds of occasions soon of later, and none  would like to embarass others or been disturbed.
12.0	Thus, suppose when i undergo a similar situation in a class , misunderstood by the professor, i would rather explain the misunderstanding afterwards personally.
5.0	First of all, personally speaking, a little mistake can be tolerated.
9.0	Talking to the teacher after class won't put much pressure on him publicly and he is more likely to accept my suggestions and reconsider my opinion.
9.0	What matters is to fix the problem, and if this could be solved peacefully, why not?
5.0	Moreover, the professor may not be consciously doing it.
8.0	It's possilbe that he doesn't even recognize the mistake.
8.0	There is the whole class waiting and I prefer not to take their time for myself.
8.0	Besides, interrupt the professor's speech directly may bring about unnecessary trouble for his lesson, because he has to pick up the clue.
2.0	lastly, though i do have other choices like stop the teacher and point his mistake immediately, or just ignore it and take no action at all,
10.0	"There is an old Chinese saying,""No beating, no success."""
12.0	In many families,parents are not allowing their child to make any mistake, and if child done it, they will give them severe punishments.
11.0	However, in my opinion, nobody could not make any mistake.
11.0	It is common for persons to do something unproper, especially children, who are too young to identify true and faulse.
5.0	First off all, mistakes are always unavoidable.
8.0	Except the bad effects to that mistakes we made lead, can't we realize anything useful and meaningful?
8.0	The answer definetly is: yes, we can.
8.0	When mistakes appear, we can not change the results, but we can reverse the next event, which is similar to the mistake we have experienced.
8.0	As long as we remember the terrible result, we could predict many other things.
8.0	For instance, as a student, I make a mistake with my homework.
8.0	Although I get a low comment on my homework, after I revise the wrong solution and review it, I am not afraid to make a same mistake on tests.
8.0	"Just like the saying that,""We can not know whether it is good or bad that the horse-keepr lost his horse."""
5.0	"Secondly, just like the name of the famous singer Jessy J's song,""Nobody is Perfect"",there is not a perfect person exist."
9.0	Even the most respectable person might pursue a  wrong way.
9.0	Here is an example, last president of America, Obama.
7.0	He once be addicted to drugs when he was young
12.0	Whether or  not students can learn much more effectively when they work in a group than when they work individually is a controversial issue that deserves to be researched.
12.0	As team work can help students to better sovle their problems as well as to obtain creative ideas, from my perspective group studying does exert more positive influence on students than studing by oneself does.
5.0	First of all, working together is beneficial for students to better manage difficult problems they face.
8.0	This is because a group of people, with their gathered wisdom and resouces, can have a great variety of solutions in a relatively short period of time.
8.0	For instance, I joined a biological study group in college and every weekend we would get together to discrss the sophisticated problems which we could not figure them out alone.
8.0	It is by working together that we can always find a better solution.
5.0	Secondly, group study is conducive for students to obtain more vreative ideas which are particularly significant in our study.
8.0	To be more precisely, by communicating with team members, people are able to share their different thoughts and ideas arise.
8.0	For example, in our buisness calss in the unibersity, we often have brainstorming meetings where every gets the chance to speak out his or her ideas and communicate them with other people.
8.0	It is by this brainstorming meeting that we put forward a lot of igenious ideas and thoughts which contributed a lot to our academic studies.
8.0	It is true that studying in a group may seem difficult to some prople, who are ingoing and do not fare to speak in public.
8.0	This is because some people are scared of making mistakes in front other people or simply because they are inborn more shy than other prople.
8.0	However, it is by workong together with group members shy people gain precious opportunities to learn how to speak out his or her ideas and how to vommunivate with others more efficiently.
1.0	To sum up, I have demonstrated that studying in a group can not only help students to better solve their problems, but it can also facilitate them to acquire vreative and original ideas whicah could greatly invrease their academic competition.
1.0	Therefore, it is definitely a wide idea to let students participate more in group study so they can gain more benefit and thus be better equipped for their future development.
3.0	Famous entertainers and athletes are always envious of their reputations and glories, and people are always curious about their daily lifes.
3.0	Not only are their charaters on the screen concerned by people but also their private life.
11.0	Nowadays, some people think celebrities should have more privacy than they have now.
11.0	I can not agree more with it.
4.0	First, to reduce famous figures exposure of daily lifes can protect them from zealots.
8.0	Take John Lennon as a  example, he is a member of a rock band named The Beatles and he is considered as one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century.
8.0	He was shot by a fanatia fan who had mental disease and died in December 8,1980.
8.0	It was a tremendous loss for music which made people to reconsider the privacy issues of the celebrities.
8.0	Sometimes fans will wait in the airport to pick up their idols and this action will lead to  a jam which may cause a stampede.
8.0	It not only does harm to famous people, but also is detrimental for the fans.
4.0	Second, everyone needs rests.
8.0	Like the actors who had just performed a program, the athletes who had just finished a competition, they had been exhausted and had to take a rest.
8.0	But they could not have a rest when their houses and hotels was exposed to the public because fans would wait there and try their best to draw their idols' attention.
8.0	If things continue this way, it is harmful to the health of those celebrities.
4.0	Last but not least, the inconformity between the role in play and the character in real life may disappoint the audiences.
9.0	Whether the moives or the TV series, they are fake stories indeed.
9.0	Enthralling in a virtual role and imposing the illusory on the actor, people may come across a conflict between envisions and facts which shometimes lets pople down.
2.0	In a word, it is better for both the celebritied and the public not to focus on the privacy of the famaous public figures.
11.0	In my opinion，I do agree with this statement that nowadays people are more willing to help the struggling people .
12.0	As we say,helpfulness is absolutly a virtuous characteristic for us humanity.
12.0	Everyone can get their sense of happyness during the period of helping others.
12.0	It can not only improve the relationship between strangers but also give us a meaningful experience.
5.0	There are some example that can prove that people would like to help others.
8.0	First,donations from individuals have been higher in recent years than in previous years.
8.0	People are more willing to donate their property to others in need to support their life.
8.0	They may now consider it as a proper way to balance the gap between the rich and the poor.
5.0	Next,social medias are becoming more and more apparent to advocate good matters and warm-heart ppople.
9.0	As a matter of fact,there are indeed more and more people who are reported by different social media.
9.0	There is an increase not only in individual donations in recent years in comparison to the past,also on the number of events of good person who are reported by social media.
0.0	In additon to this,there are more and more people who would like to make a sit for eldor nowadays.
0.0	The quality of our civil has developed a lot.
0.0	In a word,altruistic behavior is a drive for cutural society to evolve.
0.0	A good modern society is immersed from the past.
7.0	I sincere
11.0	In my opinion, I will choose the first following of the upper choices.
11.0	The opinion is that interrupt and correct the mistake right away.
11.0	The reasons are the below.
5.0	First, if I find some mistake of my teacher's class, I will rise my hand and then I will talk to the teacher and then correct the mistake of my teacher's class.
8.0	Because I think if I don't correct the class of my teacher, the other students would learn the incorrect knowledge.
8.0	And I will feel much unsuitable.
8.0	I will also change the same incorrect place in my notebook.
5.0	Second, I think this kind of action will promote the the communication between the teacher and the students.
7.0	If one teacher are taking one class in a class, the teacher deliberately set up some mistake to check whether the students listened to the lecture, but the students do not answer at all, and when the students have learn some of the incorrect
3.0	I'm afraid I have to say I disagree with this statement .
3.0	Personally I always find physical exercise more relaxing than watching a movie or reading a book .
3.0	I wouldn't like relaxing by watching or reading;they are both consuming tasks .
3.0	I have to take in information ,process it and argue about it .
3.0	When reading books information is provided by means of words ;when watching movies ,by videos and audios .
3.0	All ways require me to combine and compare the information given right now with the information I have absorbed in previously ,which calls for full-load usage of my brain .
3.0	This can hardly be seen as 'relaxing' .
3.0	Moreover ,for us students we are daily dealing with books ,which again makes the idea of  relaxing by reading books less reasonable .
6.0	I would prefer relaxing by doing physical exercises .
9.0	Running ,rope skipping ,muscle trainings ,swimming ,or even ball games ,they all sound great when it comes to relaxing .
9.0	Of course exercising means you have to deal with problems like panting for breath ,sore musles (or even a sore throat),sweat all over your skin ,and some other unmentioned problems ,yet they simply can't conceal the fact that physical exercise is a great way to save one's mind from heavy mental pressures .
2.0	Scientists have found that physical exercises ,regardless of which type of exercise you choose ,will help your body secrete hormones that can lift the stones of your mind .
9.0	Of course ,watching movies or reading books may also be helpful for relaxing ,for example ,if you choose sitcoms ,or other materials that do not require much consideration of problems you might encounter in the books or movies ,yet this doesn't mean processing with the information is not a consuming task ;it still is .
9.0	With this in mind ,I guess I would prefer watching movies or reading books when I seriously wish to think over the topic ,instead of seeing it as a choice of mentally relaxing .
7.0	Physical exercise will be my safe choice
12.0	Nowadays,students are be influnced by so much things.
11.0	People would like to find out which thing has more influence for students.
11.0	Some people thinks teachers are more influenced than their frends, others people have a negative attitude.
11.0	From my perspective, I disagree with this statement.
6.0	First of all, teachers are just teach students knowlegdes, and teachers only touch the students in school, It is not turely face of a student, they will be verytractable in school, so teacher could not teach any things except knowledge on books.
8.0	But friends know every things of their friedns, like, if the student do the homework by himself, if the student smoke.
8.0	I just take myself as a example.
8.0	When I go to shcool, I will dropoff my ear stud, and my hand ornament, and I will wear common clothes even uniform.
8.0	But when I go out of school, and go to recreate, It is a different me.
1.0	Futher more, young people prefer to follow the advice with their firends but not their teachers.
1.0	I mean, most of students dislike their teachers, even they will hate teachers, so students absolutely will not listen to teachers advice, even if the teacher is right.
10.0	But students trust their friends, and they are willing to listen to their friends.
7.0	This case is too normaly, so i can not have a specifit example  mei shi
3.0	I think that is a reelly good idea that bike sharing scheme.
3.0	First at that time in Wuhan.
3.0	The subways line was amost compulit and there also have a lot of bus station.
3.0	But some they can not really get anywhere.
3.0	Forexmple like when I go to school I should take subways but when I get off the trian sation I still need wake about ten mins.
3.0	But after The bike sharing scheme appear in Wuhan.
11.0	That really safe me alot of time now I only need 1 min to find a bike than take 3 mins ride to school.
10.0	I saved 6 mins evey days.
5.0	Than bike sharing it is really convenience.
8.0	Like before I have my own bike I always have a question that where I prak my bike.
8.0	But now I do not need worry about it.
8.0	Now in Wuhan there have alot of bike sharing scheme so there open a lot of place to park the bike.
8.0	I just need find a place there have alot of bike than park it will be fine.
5.0	In the end that is really save my money.
8.0	Before I bought alot of bikes.
8.0	Evey time someone steal my bike.
8.0	Than I need by a new one.
8.0	After my thrid bike bening steal.
8.0	I give up to ride the bike.
8.0	Than some time I will go to a near place that will wake about 20 more mins aways I will take taxi.
8.0	That really spend me alot of money.
8.0	But now we have the bike sharing scheme will easy to let me find a cheap way to go somewhere is not to far.
2.0	So I think now the bike sharing scheme is a evey popular way to get out and also is good ways help us out.
12.0	I think parents offer their school-age children money for each high mark is a good idea.
8.0	There are two reasons.
8.0	The first one  is that giving money can stimulate children to put  more effort on their school work.
8.0	Generally, children dislike boring school stuff, they will not be interested in it unless they get something.
8.0	However, parents are not god, they don not know their kids as well as the kids themselves.
8.0	Giving money is a great method rather than offering other objects directly.
8.0	Parents do not know what their chidren really want.
8.0	kids can cost the money on things they demand without telling parents because some parents don't allow kids to spend on the things that are not related to schoolwork.
8.0	For example, my best friend loves buying dolls such as teddy bear or barbie series.
8.0	She dares to tell her mom that she wants to buy those dolls because dolls are too childish for teenagers.
8.0	As a  result, every time she asks me to buy her dolls.
8.0	This makes her family relationship nervous.
8.0	She is rewarded with money due to her high mark on tests, however, she can't cost money freely without parents' permission.
8.0	Another condition is that some kids can save the money in order to get a big acheivement.
8.0	For example,some boys like buying electric airplane models which are not cheap at all; Or girls like buying gorgeous dresses and famous make-up brands such as Channel and Dior.
8.0	Many kids do not really care about their grades themselves, the ones who care are their parents.
8.0	Some parents are very competitive to other parents.
8.0	Knowing their own child gets higher grade than other children can satisfy their vanity.
8.0	This can be regarded as a teamwork.
8.0	The higher mark children earn, the more money parents reward.
8.0	Parents and children can both be happy if they gain what they want.
8.0	Thus, offering children money can improve the relationship between parents and children.
3.0	Recently, an interesting question has aroused a heated debate: in order to attract tourists, whether government should hire more police to improve the safety and impove the old buildings and streets to enhance the appearance.
3.0	Answers vary from person to person, some people claim that we should actually do this.
3.0	However, I will stand on their opposite side.
11.0	This is because I believe that we have
5.0	Firstly, government can increase the advertisement for the city to attract more tourists.
8.0	This is beacuse we are willing to go to a city for sightseeing because we have some knowledge of the features about this city.
8.0	So the more expose of the city, the more tourists will come.
8.0	On the contrary, if the government do add the advertisement for the city, the tourists would not choose this city for traveling because of lacking information.
8.0	For example, Chengdu which is the big city in the China makes numerous advertisement about the city which is the home for the panada.
8.0	So many tourists from all over the world would go to the city for seeing the panada, which help the government attract many tourists.
5.0	Secondly, government could establish many theme parks to attract more tourists.
8.0	As we all know,modern people have a great amount of pressure in the life and work.
8.0	So many people want to relax themselves by playing entertainment facilities, which are the part of the theme park.
8.0	So the government could build theme park to attract more tourists.
8.0	In contrast, if the government do not do this, many tourists would choose other place to release their pressure.
8.0	For example, Disney park can attract many tourists from  different places.
8.0	Shanghai builds a theme park, which would increase the tourists number about fifteen percents every year.
1.0	To put it in a nutshell, I firmly disagree that government should hire more police or improve the old buildings and streets to attract more tourists.
1.0	This is because we could increase the advertisement and build more theme parks to attract more tourists
12.0	When asked about if people today are more willing to help the struggling strangers, different people hold different views.
11.0	Some people agree with this opinons, but others think people today don't willing to help the struggling strangers.
11.0	As to me, I think people are more likely to help others now.
11.0	And there are some reason to list.
5.0	First of all, with development of society, people's living life become more and more better, and they are more capable of helping strangers in need.
8.0	In the past, the most of people are very poor, and they are only content to eat and wear warm.
8.0	Even many people can't eat and wear warm, they have not ability to help others.
8.0	However, in the modern society, people are not only satisfied with food and clothing, but also they start to pursue spiritual entertainment.
8.0	So they have more capable to help others.
8.0	For example, my friend's fimily ecnomic become more and more better with development, and her parent will give many money to her every day.
8.0	One day, my moey lost, and I am very sad, I harim my mother will angery, my friend knowed, she borrow her money to me, to solve this promble.
8.0	I am very happy and very thanks for her.
8.0	But if in the past, she will have no  The second, in modren society, thanks for science and technolagy development.
8.0	People are not stepping out of the leaving room, they can know what happend in the world.
8.0	So many people who need help will be know to more people, and they can get more help.
8.0	Today, people can know struggling people by newspaper and TV.
8.0	For example, one day, my mother are watching TV, there are a girl have cancer, and she need money to have an operation.
8.0	But she have not enought money.
8.0	My mother choose to help her, althourh she is a stranger.
5.0	Admittedly, nowaday, having some people become indifference, but this are a little people.
9.0	And have the most of people are willing to help other people.
9.0	So I think people are more likely to help others now.
0.0	All in all, I think people are more likely to help others now, because they are more capable of helping strangers in need than people in the past.
0.0	Also,  people can know struggling people by newspaper and TV, so many people who need help will be know to more people.
0.0	And they can get a lot of people's help.
12.0	Some people in sociaty may hold the statement that we should keep making diffrerent kinds of friends rather than keep in touch with a few people.
11.0	however, when it comes to an opinion that it is more imporant to  maintain relationships with some person we trust, I strongly agree .
12.0	For only two simple reasons: we should study together like a team and selecting faithful people to be our friends is necessary.
5.0	Admittedly.
8.0	it is important to make friends with people you don't know.
8.0	We need to meet lots of strangers when we are working and studying.
8.0	In that case, it is better to communicate with others to make sure that you can get the target.
8.0	You can get well with them, and more deeply, you can improve the relationshap to become friendship.
8.0	However, it isn't easy to maintain a friendship over a long period of time.
8.0	And it si necessary to cultivate the ability to hold on to our friends.
5.0	First and foremost, we should stick to a firm relatinship with a few person that we have already know.
8.0	It is a good way to solve problems in a group.
8.0	For instance, when we are doing a tough mission, it is impossable to finish it by oneself.
8.0	If we can invit a lot of friends to work togrther like a team,  it can save much time to get the target and be more efficient.
8.0	By contrast, without cooperation with our friends, we can not combine a variety of ideas to make a wonderful plan, and it is not benefit to our relationship.
2.0	In addition, we need to trust someone in our daily life .
7.0	If we always change aou friends, we can o
11.0	With the devolopment of the socity more and more people start to get physical exrcise the reason for that is that people realize that it really importance of doing some physical exercise to keep them health, and I don't agree that physical exercise is much more importat for old than for the young.
4.0	If young people get daily exercise, they can get the stronger bodies than before.
8.0	many people know that the reason for they get illnesses it their bodies are in subhealth conditon when thay are young , but they never realize that they should get some exercise at that time.
8.0	If nowaday young people get some daily exercise right now they probably won't suffer from some diseases when they are old.
8.0	Compare to get physical exercise when we get old and with diseases, I think they we need to take exercise right now.
4.0	When old people try to start to take some phycial exercise they may get hurt for they have no experience about  some sport.
9.0	Because the old people are more likely get hurt during the sport events than the young people, so it's truely important for old people to accumlate some sport experiences to aovid them get hurt.
9.0	But if they don't do some physical exercise when they are young, it's really hard for these old people to get enoungh safty tips when they get some exercise.
4.0	And nowaday young people's pressures from jobs are biger and biger.
8.0	Many of them are in the subhealth condition, because of some high pressure working condition.
8.0	Sometimes they even more need exercise than the old people.
8.0	because of the high rate of sudden death.
8.0	they probably can't became old people because of the sudden death, they may die when that are young .
11.0	I think to give a school-age children money for high grade they get in school it is a great way to inspaire children to study harder.
11.0	But give money as an reward everytime is not a good way.
12.0	My opinions are based on followings.
5.0	Firstly,when children have some progress in study,parents can give them some pin money as a reward,that can make childern have more energy to study,but their are many other ways can inspire them ,not only to give money but also can take them on a  trip ,buy a new phone for them or take them for a great meal.
10.0	May be children are more think highly of praise from their parents.
5.0	Besides , if praents give money everytime when they make progress in studyand childern can get money easily when they need money,that may be will establish  a bad habit in their life ,may be they just use the money randomly ,actually they just don't know how to use the money.
7.0	So, in my opinion ,give money is just one way to encourage children to study hard ,but what they really need is  more concentrate from their parents
3.0	It's common for some parents to offer their school-age children money for the high grade they get in school.
3.0	However,there is a debate about that whether it is a good idea for parents to stimilate their children with money.
12.0	Everything has it's pros and cons,but I can tell from my own exprience that this is a good idea.
12.0	Let me tell you why.
5.0	First of all,we can all agree on that study,specially for most children,is not a very pleasing thing.
9.0	So some stimilation from parent would be great.
9.0	It doesn't matter what you use to get the children interested in study,but money is an obvious choice.
5.0	On the other hand,some may state that it's not safe for children to hold on a big amount of money,and that it's not good for children's education.
8.0	Well,I have to agree that there is a risk that children wast the money they get form the high grade,and maybe they will thing study is for money rather than enrich theirselves.
8.0	Yet,that's what parents for.
8.0	It's their duty to guide their children,and teach them how to make use of the money they get for their high grade.
8.0	So if you think it form another aspective,it can be good for your children.
1.0	Finally,to give children awards for their efforts is a good idea,specially when you get the oppotunity to teach children independence.
1.0	After children receve the money form parents,they can try to get what they want by put efforts in study.
7.0	And this is actually great oppotu
3.0	With the living standard in our normal lives improve a lot, people ger more and more chance to travel outside during their leisure time.
11.0	I found that many prople who close to me prefer to travel in our own countries and they give me some reasons to support their own idea.
5.0	As you know that our country have a long history so that you could learn lots of culture sediment.
8.0	In my opinion, People should get access to study their domestic culture and travel is a good method to develop it.
8.0	When you reach to a new place, according the delicious food and famous eyesights, you may extend your knowledge width even you will enjoy it at the same time.
8.0	Also throughout the local guide explaining and what you see by yourself, the express you receive may impressive and memorable.
8.0	It is easier to render more knowledge than learn foreign culture because you have already understand a little.
5.0	In addition, As a domestic citizen, We have the obligation to know our culture clearly.
8.0	When your foreign friends come your country and ask for the local culture, it may become a embrasses moment when you can't answer their questions.
8.0	That is really shame.
8.0	As a result, After you travel lots of  places at your own country, you must have a widh knowledge and you could explain to others without any doubts.
0.0	Some people argues that traveling aborad is more intriguing, and what you see may beyond your expect.
0.0	However, I reckon that when lots of people travel to one place, Local dweller living condition must improve a lot because tourist will bring many walfare and economic help.
0.0	When the consumption at one place enhance a lot, local dweller will get more rich.
0.0	Suppose that if you have a trip at a domestic place, it means that your contribution may boost the local economy develop.
3.0	When it refers to whether parents should to offer their school-age children money for each high grade that they get in school, the disscussion over this issue provokes widepread concern.
12.0	Among the society of the society, some hold that to give the money to the students plays a vital part in students campus life, but the oppoents ast doubt on this statement.
12.0	Form my perspective, my preference goes to give the money to the students for their high grade is a good idea for students' campuse life.
5.0	To beging with, parents give the money to their students when the students get good grade at their school can as a gift to encourage students to work hard for study.
8.0	Most of the students have a lot of things want to buy and they store these things in their mind.
8.0	Parents always give the money to students,and when students get the money always leave the money in their own poket.
8.0	Because whey want to store the money to buy whatever they want.
8.0	Some of them like to think about how they can buy the staff that they want during the in class.
8.0	If they think about these things in the calss, it will effect their grade.
8.0	So if the students parents give money to them when they doing great at school.
8.0	It is a good mmotivation to study well and work hard.
5.0	Additionally, it can help students to get more knowledge for how their parent get money and understand how hard to get money.
8.0	This will help students to understand their parents are very fortunate, let them cherish what they have now.
8.0	As we know most students lack the consciousness of saving.
8.0	they like to waste food, water and  so on.
8.0	They throw the things at one second, but the people make all the things with a lot of sweat.
8.0	they cannot waste it.
8.0	it is not fair and nood good.
0.0	From what we disscussed above, may may saving draw the conclusion.
0.0	Parents give the money to thir kids when the kids doing grade at school is a good idea.
0.0	It can help students to have the motivate to work hard at school and can teach them not to waste food.
0.0	I think it is a really good idea.
3.0	At the modern society, with the growth of economy and technology, they provide more and more opportunites to enjoy our life or relax.
3.0	Some people even raise a new idea-- relax by watching a movie , reading a  book or other brain activities are more relax than doing physical exercise.
11.0	I disagree about this thougjht because I think it's wrong.
11.0	Let me tell the reason.
4.0	Doing exercise offers you many benfitis to one's physiological.
8.0	As opposed to watching TV or reading books where energy is very low., but physical exercise aid in efficient bloof flow and make our body strong.
8.0	On the other country, less exercise leads many horrible healthy problem.
8.0	such as fat, high blood pressure, heart disease, and obesity.
8.0	To be able truly relax one must possess a healthy body, and has to be achieved by healthier acrtivities like jogging, go to gym for physical training, or mountain climbing, rather than sitting in a chair all day long.
4.0	Moreover, exercise help people utilize theie time more constructively.
9.0	People gain motor skills and other revelent like strength, flexibility and corordination.
9.0	on the other hand, watch tb or read books are and up making views imitate bad habits which they see from actor or read books.
4.0	Finally, somr forms of exercise encourage socialization and team building, which is a much greater way to relax than being alone.
10.0	Examples of these exercise include many of the collectiive sports people of doing such as soccer ball or basketball.
10.0	In a nut
3.0	history is a development and growing of a country from beform to now.
3.0	Some people think that there is no reason to study history in universities.
11.0	But I think every university stundent need to study history course whatever whether it is their majar course.
4.0	Firstly, understanding history can help students to study their majar better.
8.0	If a person's major course is art.
8.0	He has known more about art history than others, like background of star sky or the experiences of Van Gao.
8.0	He will draw more actively about his painting.
8.0	So history should be studied by university students.
4.0	Secondly, history is also a course in universities.
8.0	Studying a new course also is a challenge.
8.0	When a person is learning the history, maybe he will find interests in it ,such as events of a hero, and want to know more about the hero.
8.0	After that he will learn the hero's quality and personality.
8.0	It help him to be a better person.
8.0	History can change mental situation of a person.
4.0	Finally, Studying history in a group can make friends with each other.
8.0	Students can join a history club and discuss opinions with each other.
8.0	For instance, there are some of students whose major is not history, but they also like history.
8.0	They will join the club and find the knowledge of history.
8.0	It help these people know more about history.
1.0	In conclusion, studying history is a process for a long time.
1.0	Every students should understand some of history of own country because it make students like the society that was made by assents.
3.0	Along with the increasement of population, the society becomes more and more competitve.
3.0	Therefore,  many parents are compeletely devoted into their work so that they have little time to keep their children company.
3.0	Then, a debate is quickly put forward that when parents are busy, what is the best way for children to use that time.
12.0	As far as I am concerned, it's better to spend this time to have fun such as playing games or sports.
6.0	First of all, children can relax theirselves when playing games or sports.
8.0	As we all know, children are usually occupied with their schoolwork in school and many students even infinite homework to do.
8.0	So most of all are feel stessed with the acadimic things.
8.0	In this situation, some proper relation is indispensable for them.
8.0	If you compel your children study all the day, they would lost the right to feel happiness.
8.0	What's more, some students who face excess pressure even end their young lives.
8.0	For the blance between schoolwork and recreation is important, children should use that time for relaxation.
2.0	Additionly, children can extend their social network if they use that time to play games or sports.
9.0	There is no need to emphasis the significance of social relationship.
9.0	Th
12.0	There are many things to consider about achieving success, while different people may have different ideas about the way to achieve success.
11.0	Some people think that we should alway follow our dreams even if the dreams are ambitious.
11.0	But as far as I concerned, I firmly believe that we should just focus on achieving realistic goals.
11.0	My reasons are as follow.
4.0	To begin with, many dreams, even looks like ambitious, are very difficult for us to achieve it.
8.0	This is because  most of times, dreams are just inner thoughts that people hope to realize and they are not realistic.
8.0	For example, to people born in the poor families, what they really want to achieve is usually to become rich person and change their fate.
8.0	However, with the rapid develpoment of society, the social status have formed, which make it difficult for themselves to achieve their abitious goal.
8.0	To contrast, if their follow the realitic goals, just like to be a good man and keep good relationship with others.
8.0	it will be more accessible for them.
4.0	In addition,  any great and ambitious goals consist of some small and realistic goals.
8.0	As a chinese proverb goes that if a person cannot clean one house, they will not clean the world.
8.0	Literally, it told us that if we want to reach some ambitious dreams, we should take several steps that is essencial to dreams.
8.0	There is no doubt that greatmen might not know what the person they would become.
8.0	It is due to their hard work and achieve their realistic goals one by one that they finally reached their life peaks.
4.0	Take chinese famous scientists, Qian Weichang,a famous physicist in th world.
9.0	However, opposed to common thinking, Mr Qian was not good at physics, let alone became a scientist.
9.0	Through his several years hard working, they made a great progress and achieve a lot of so-called realistic goals and became a great scientist.
1.0	All in all, I firmly believe that we should be more realistic and just finish the goals one by one.
1.0	Finally, we can achieve our special sucess
12.0	Today, there is a hot topic: whether people can get leadership by learning.
12.0	Answers varies from people to people.
11.0	Some people claims that no person can learn to be a leader.
11.0	Contrary to their opinion comes my concept that it is possible to be a leader by learning.
5.0	To begin with, being a leader require amounts professional knowledges which can be get by learning.
8.0	It is acknowlegded that people who owns professional skills or knowledges make better decison in a shorter time than other people do.
8.0	This capability make subordinates be willing to follow the person possible.
8.0	Since everyone is able to get expertise by learning from books, teachers, and diverse sources, people can obtain leadership by learning.
8.0	For instance, when I entered university, I had no experience of being a leader, even being a study group leader.
8.0	I spent 10 hours every day in doing researches and writing relevent paper during a year, I got the highest academic performance in my class.
8.0	The professional knowledge I earned helps me to be the leader of the research group.
5.0	ecendly, people who is adept to relate other people would likely to be a good leader.
9.0	Since social skills can be learned by practicing, people obatain leadership by learning socal skills.
9.0	If people is good at relating to other people, he or she would attract more investments, customers as well as employees, which would help him or her to be a good leader.
2.0	In general, I think people can become a leader by learning.
3.0	In order to motivate chidren to study hard, some parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.
12.0	It has caused heated debate.
11.0	In my opinion, it is a good idea to do so.
4.0	First of the all, it can motivate chidren to study to get higher grade.
10.0	High grade is useful to get more advanced education, which is good for the future of children.
4.0	Secondly,it can improve the ability of managing money matters.
8.0	But we shoud not give money to children with no requirements, or they wil not cherish the money.
8.0	But if we  ask them to do some housework for money, we will be worried aboutt whether their time for study is enough.
8.0	And offering money for each high grade will make them pay more attention on their study.
4.0	The last but not the least, it can promote family harmony.
9.0	Let children understand the fact that earning money needs to make efforts, they will not be unreasonable.
9.0	And we can konw more about their grade in their school and give them some useful suggestions.
7.0	In conclusion, it is a good idea to offer children money for each high grade to motivate them to study hard,
11.0	Nowadays, people are under more and more pressure in the rapidlly growing society so many couples are not even able to take care of themselves well.
12.0	Under that condition, giving birth to a baby and carefully raise up a baby can be really hard, so parents should come up with more efficient ideas to teach thier child how to grow correctly.
11.0	Among those stratigies, letting children make mistakes and learn from them can be very useful and effective.
11.0	So I would agree with the statement.
12.0	Here comes my own idea about the statement.
5.0	First of all, rasing a child is a work that demands a lot of attention and time, and no one wants to waste the precious emotion and time.
9.0	Letting children do thier own things means that parents can have more of thier time instead of spending all their free time with children, or in other words, they can do other things they like, not trapped in the babysitting work.
9.0	And while children can learn form their mistakes, parents can do less things such as teaching children lessons which they might not be interested at all and telling children what they can do or what they cannot do.
5.0	Secondly, as for the children themselves, growing independence is always a progress they will have to experience.
8.0	Every child will become an adult one day and the society is unlikely to accept a person who cannot deal with his or her own private things.
8.0	So it is essential for a parents to foster thier children's ability of independence in case that they cannot fit the surrounding enviroment.
8.0	Still, we always find that learing through our mistakes is a very efficient way to improve ourselves as the impression is usually very deep in our mind, different from the lessons other people teach.
8.0	Take that into consideration, learning from our own mistakes is very benificiary.
8.0	Admittedly, parents should prevent thier kids from suffering and not a parent want to see his or her child crying for making mistakes.
8.0	But as the saying goes, no pain, no gain.
8.0	Only with the baptism from distress can we become stronger and stonger.
8.0	So parents should sometimes let their children go for a while, let them jump into the ocean of real world and get touch with the mistakes and pains they get.
8.0	Only with these setbacks can a child grow more healthier.
0.0	To draw a conclusion, I would say that letting children make mistakes and letting them learn from thier own mistakes is no doubt a good direction for parents to follow.
0.0	The child growing with mistakes and then trying to avoid mistakes the next time is always better than the child growing in a green house and being treated like a flower.
0.0	Mistakes can make children grow independently, so just let your children make thier own mistakes and try to fix themse
3.0	In the wake of globalization, we can have easier access to the relevant events happen from home and abroad.
3.0	However this new trend of acquiring sufficient information around the world also bring about a contravertial debate that whether it is necessary or not for us to be concerned about events happening internationally even though they have little to do with our daily routines.
11.0	Opinions on this issue vary from person to person.
12.0	From my perspective, I firmly contends that it is of great significance for us to know what is happening around the world despite that they have scarce influence on our daily life.
5.0	First and foremost, knowing current news can broaden our horizons.
8.0	Events happen around the world can guide us into knowing some extotic things and have a better and well-rounded knowledge of foreign countries.
8.0	For example, when we read the news of the American universities, we can gain some instructional insight about their school life and academic progress, which is surely to extend our understanding of foreigners.
8.0	Besides, when listening to some English news, we can also improve our listening ability and have some similar topics to talk with exchanged students.
5.0	Furthermore, going deep into some political issues can foster a sense of responsibility and sharpen our minds.
8.0	Although the political issues may not involve with our daily life, discussing about them can add colour to our spiritual world and make ourselves mature more quickly.
8.0	When it comes to the problem of refugee, I really think a lot.
8.0	First is the humanity, which plays an important role in whether other countries should provide shelters for them.
8.0	Second is the resposibility each country shoulders for their own citizens.
8.0	The violent campaigns caused by the refugees are numerous which also put the government in a dilemma.
8.0	Only when I know the refugee event can think that much.
2.0	All in all, in spite of the fact that events happening around the world may really has slim impact on our daily life, I still subscribe to the view that it is necessary.
11.0	When it comes to the statement that whether parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.
11.0	So far as I'm concerned, I just agree it.
6.0	First of all, we all konw that it‘s very hard for parents to allow their child to make a mistake.
8.0	They will try their best to protect their children and avoid the happen of the mistakes.
8.0	But on the other hand,parents should just let them go,as they can't protect them for a life.
8.0	What's the most important,children grow up just when they make mistakes and then correct it .
8.0	The process is very crucial for their growth.
8.0	No matter how parents want to help their children, they need their free time to sovle all the problems they cause.
8.0	Parents just give them the right point and ensure that they won't lose their dignity and confidence.
8.0	Now I should tell you a story:my brother's son,whose name is king,is very naughty.
8.0	And my brother always can't take care of him.
8.0	When he come home after the work, the house become very mess,sometimes the glasses are broken.
8.0	Of course,he is very angry and criticizes his boy ,but he can't find a good way to solve the problem properly.
8.0	One day,I make a visit to his house and make a talk with my nephew.
8.0	I just tell him that he need to clean the room,otherwise he will never be allowed to watch the cartoons.
8.0	He make a promise and clean the room.
8.0	After that,he tell me that doing the chores is very tired and I will never throw anything anyway.
8.0	We can learn something from the little story,children always make mistakes ,as they don't know it's  a wrong thing and they never think that his behavious will cause trouble to others.
7.0	In conclusion, if we want our children to develope a good manner a
12.0	There has been a controversy about whether leadershing comes naturally or can be nurtured.
11.0	There do exist some people  who are naturally qualified to be a good leader.
11.0	However, it does not mean people can not learn to be a leader.
11.0	From my perspective, most leadership is learned except some specialist.
4.0	Leadership evolves managing people around, which means you firstly had to have a proper relationship with people around you, including your own leaders.
8.0	Relationship will not come naturally, so will the leadership.
8.0	Moreover, as a good leader, you have not only care about the effectiveness of the work you superiors are doing, sometimes, but also the emotion about your workers have.
8.0	Which indicates you to care both the work and the life of them.
8.0	all of those have to be learned before you become a real leader.
4.0	As I mentioned above, there did exist some people who become leaders easily as naturally.
8.0	It seems that they have already the ability or quite quilified to be a leader.
8.0	There is no doubt that some people have the talents to be a leader, those talents still have to learn both skills of dealing with other people and managements of a comapany.
8.0	They just learn things more naturally and quickly than normal people.
8.0	This may make us think that their leadership come naturally.
4.0	Further more, good leaders are always good learners.
9.0	They have to consider different things people from various aspects.
9.0	it is certain that a leader do not like learning will last long.
0.0	Everything should be learned, including leadership.
0.0	it just all depends on the amount of the time and efforts one have made to become a good leader.
0.0	for talented people, they do learn things qulickly, however, it does not mean that normal people could not become a leader.
0.0	in conclusion, leadership does not come naturally, but learned.
11.0	It is really common for children to make mistakes in the early age.
12.0	After all, they are unexperienced.
12.0	"A saying says""You can never complain about children's fault""."
11.0	For they are still young and it is not possible for them not making mistakes.
12.0	Since making mistakes is the nature of humanbeings, why shouldn't the parents allowing their children making mistakes?
12.0	And I would  furhter develope my argument as two parts.
5.0	First, I have to say that mistakes are impossible to be eliminated.
8.0	Humanbeings make mistakes from the moment of birth to the end of the life.
8.0	Mistakes are inevitable in our lifes.
8.0	Making mistakes are the human nature,so haw can we change the human nature?
8.0	We can only learn from the mistakes we have made before, for the sake of not making the same mistake.
8.0	"It is well-knowned  that ""Failure is the mother of success""."
8.0	As parents, we expect our children to be successful.
8.0	On the way of success, it must be having different mistakes.
5.0	Second, I don't approve of scolding children because they made mistakes.
8.0	Parents cannot create the image that making mistakes is a really serious fault.
8.0	Making mistakes, to some extent, means that he is innnovative.
8.0	Only those who is brave enough to experience different kinds of life would make mistakes.
8.0	Those who are conservative and without passion would not be likely to make mistakes.
0.0	All in all, I think mistakes are good chances for children to learn.
0.0	As parents, allowing of mistaking is a way to encourge children to be open minded, which is benenificial of their future development.
0.0	I strongely belived that making mistakes is bnefitial of children's future.
3.0	Are our kids becoming lazier and less creative, less imaginable than before as a conquence of highly advanced technology?
12.0	My oppinion is no, and just the opposite, technology has apparently assisted our kids to become more creative.
5.0	Firstly, technology has provided children with easy access to scientific and liberal art resources which is their best source of inspiration.
8.0	For example, children could now easily gain access to academic databases through the screens of the electronic productions, read classical famous work on the Kindle, or whact historic videoss on many video applications.
8.0	However, these wonderful equipments and facilities are never as handy in the past, when kids could only reach limited recources in public labraries or schools.
8.0	In this sense, technology has provided the possibility for children to be more creative.
5.0	Second, technology equipped children with professional apparatus which vould finally realize their imagination.
9.0	This takes from particularly as computer softwares and applications, such as Photoshop for creative graphic design, over ture for easily composing a piece of music, 3DMax for building up a virtual world, etc.
9.0	All the softwares were never as handy as they are at present, and this would absolutely provide our children an effective tool for realizing their creativity.
7.0	Third, technology itself is a market place where creative ideas are economically encour
3.0	Going on a journey is a benificial thing that helps people to open their mind and enrich their experiences.
12.0	Some people like to design a relaxed route by themselves to visit another places.
12.0	Another people tend to travel in a group led by a tour guide.
12.0	However, I perfer to let a tour guide show me around with a grop.
12.0	So I agree with the statement that it is a best way to travel in a group by a guide.
6.0	Firstly, tour guides can make a travelling plan that visitor do not need spend more time to do.
8.0	When I decide to visit a historical city, I should understand that how local people life, what the tradition, lifestyles or food a like.
8.0	Also, I need find the the specific route of special landscape, famous building before I go th the city.
8.0	It is gong to give me a trouble thus I will give up the plan.
8.0	But a tour guide will solve
3.0	The significance of internet's advantage or disadvantage can never be overemphasized because it is closely related to    development of technology.
3.0	Recently, there have been a lot of controversies about whether internet give people a lot of valuable information or many problems.
3.0	Towards such a long-running rug-of-war, I am inclined to argue that internet provides people with more bad things.
12.0	I also have some examples and reasons to illustrate my point of view.
5.0	First of all, the internet always have many unhealthy things.
8.0	There is no doubt that these bad things are wrong to people.
8.0	And I think it have best trouble to children.
8.0	Because in this development society, every family have the develop  technology, such as, TV, computers and phone.
8.0	When people was a child, his or her ability of ilimitat is best, however.
8.0	They will see some unhealthy things in the internet, like violence and pornographic ecroticism.
8.0	And they will ilimitate these, finally, do something wrong in this society when they grow up.
8.0	In contrast, if not have internet, they cannot know something unhealthy in every things nearby themself, and their thinking is clear.
8.0	When they grown, they only know do something benefitial to contribute to society and country.
5.0	Admittedly, the internet can provide people with a lot of valuable information and make people's life more convenience.
8.0	For example, when students have question in one sbject and aren't teather nearby, they can gain the knowledge by internet only spend short time.
8.0	However, the internet must be transmited in phone or computers.
8.0	Thus, long time to watch them will have influence on eye sight.
8.0	A survey contary by university of BeiJing suggest that every a hundred of people might have eighty people have shortage in eye sight.
8.0	Consequently, the internet not only can provides people with important information, but also can give people glasses.
1.0	Taking all the factors above into accont, an unshakable conclusion can be drawn that internet can provide people with mant problems.
1.0	It is not only because bad influence on spirit, but also because have influence on physices.
3.0	Porject is the way that students learn the knowledge, and teachers now tend to give to ways for students to finish a project.
12.0	Views went differ when it comes to the question whether students can learn much more effectively by working together than by working alone.
12.0	From my perspective, I think the students can benefit more from the teamwork.
4.0	To begin with, work together means more poeple paticipate in the project so there will be more ideas.
9.0	It takes time when a person try to decide the best way to work out a project, but for a team, it's much easier.
9.0	Imagine that there is a project requirres students to finish it in different ways,virous ideas can be came up thus the group members are all benefited because they can exchange the idea and learn more about the knowledge through the group discussion.
4.0	In addition, working in a group can save time because people can have a devision of the work.
8.0	Students can devide the work apart so  the learning can be much more effective.
8.0	For, example, last month my history professor ask us to write a pappe about the recent mucis history.
8.0	I gathered other calssmates to finish the work together, and each of them has his or her own expertise.
8.0	For the interview part, we choose the student who is good at communicating to interview an musician, and for information collection part, the students who masters the computer was assigned.
8.0	Finally we are the fastest to complete the professoers' assignment, and we used the rest of time to deeper study the mucic history.
4.0	Admittedly, working alone on projects do have some benefits such as the quiet environment.
10.0	But there are still many difficulties which can't help studetents learn effectively.
2.0	Take all above into consideration, I still believe that when teacher assign the projsts that requirres students to work together, students will learn much more effectiely, since group members can obtain different ideas in a short time, and save time to study more about the course.
12.0	As we all know,friends play a essential part in our daily daily routine.
8.0	Due to friends,we can lead to a happier life .
8.0	Due to friends,we can have courage to face the challenge.
8.0	Due to friends,we can open our arms to embrace a brighter future.
8.0	However,people have various reference to choose what kind of friend they want to be with.
8.0	Consequently,when it comes to friends,there is a question needs to be discussed deeply.
8.0	The questions is whether it is better to make friends with intelligent people than with the people who have a good sense of humor.
8.0	From where I stand,I firmly hold the perspective that the people who have a better sense of humor is a better choice.
8.0	The reasons are as follow,
3.0	Some people think parents shouldn't let children make mistake and let them learn from their own mistake.
12.0	However, I have a different idea, when it comes to the statement that parents should let children make mistake and let them learn from their own mistake.
11.0	I strongly agree.
12.0	There are some reason why i fell this way: children should make a mistake learn their mistake and learn how to mistake , and is children can learn their mistake can remain their next can't again happen.
4.0	Admittedly, I think he have a different ways, in some familys the parents can't ban the children make a mistake.
8.0	for example, in the severe familys their parents is very severe, their parents is very severe to their children ,so in their familys parents is very severe.
8.0	than their children can't make a mistake.
8.0	However I think I have another better ways.
4.0	First, I think children should make a mistake, because the children make a mistake they can learn their how to mistake, such us, if the children play in the home he careless broken flower screen, their parents it blame the children.
9.0	but in this children can remember that .
9.0	so i think the children can make a mistake.
4.0	Second, I agree this statement, because the children learn their mistake can remain thier next can't again happen.
8.0	"for instance, if the peolpe play the basketball in the road he carefull to the ball fly the other homes windows, the windows is crush, that is ""pi-pang"" next their parents go to the other homes apologize."
8.0	And ask their children next time can't play the basketball in the road and can't crush the other homes windows, play the basketball should go to playground. .
8.0	so I think that is a great idea.
2.0	I summary the parents should let children make mistake and let them learn form there own mistake because i have 2 ways: one is children should not make the tings, and another is remian thier next can't again happen.
3.0	There is a widely discussed topic nowadays about how people nowadays are less happy or less satisfied with their lives than perople were in the past since the world is changing so quickly.
3.0	While most people might have agreed with this statement, I hold a rather different thought.
3.0	It is true that our whole community, from working to living environments are moving rather fast right now, and we all have to speed up our paces to go along with their world.
11.0	Whether people are less happy because of that is yet to be discussed, and my reasons why most people are still happy and passionate about their lives are as follwing.
4.0	To start with, since the world changing so fast, new inventions and technologies are been developed fast as well, and those have brought us countless convience and enjoyment.
8.0	Back to the old days, by which I mean before even the camera is invented, not to even mention television and smart phones.
8.0	"We might have seen from the documentary film about the life of people back in the ""non-elecctric"" days."
8.0	For ordinary people, what the male do all day is just farming, planting while the female will just do some tapestries at home.
8.0	The only way they can entertain themselves is to drink, to dance and to chat with other peole.
8.0	While most of the peasans do not know how to read, they can not even enjoy reading.
8.0	The aristocrates seemed to have a little bit more fun with the social events.
8.0	but that doesnot seem to be enough.
8.0	One of the most common scene I have see from the films is when the aristocrates seems in their giant meeting room boredly, playing their cards endlessly and always discuss what they can do next.
8.0	Do we want that kind of life?
8.0	I don't think so.
8.0	Nowadays, with the inventions of  television, smart phone and mainly more entertatinments, we have so much more of entertainment.
8.0	Since we are all loaded with works during the daytime, we can completely relax ourselves from those entertainment.
8.0	If you want to read, you can just search the book on my phone, and  read whatever I want.
8.0	How convenience is that?
8.0	So while the world is changing fast, it has brought us tons of entertainments and benefits that we are happy about.
4.0	The second reason is that, while the world is running fast, giving us new chllanges and lots of works on a daily base, we should take it fopr granted, and embrace these challanges to achieve the sense of satisfication.
8.0	Take myself as an example, as a teaching assistant in the New Channel right now, I am facing a lot more challenges and obstacles then what I have expected.
8.0	Before I entered this field, I though the only thing that teaching assistant needs to do is to tutor the students, and help them achieve their goals.
8.0	However, that is obivously not the case, I have to deal with so much more.
8.0	While been a good tutor who can truly help the students academically and mentally, I have to also deal with the communication with the parents, and manage some side business that I was definitely not familiar with.
8.0	In the beginning, I was busy all day, I was so stressed that I am quite unhappy about my life.
8.0	But I just do not want to give up, I do think the sense of obligation and challenging is helping.
8.0	Now being good at whatever my duty is feels so good, I do feel the obstacles I had in the beginning has let me to fully appreciate my life right now.
8.0	While the world is changing so fast, we should embrace the challenges to live a happier life.
4.0	I do understand how people are less happy becuase they think the world is changing so fast, and they can not keep up with the pace of the world.
9.0	They are under lots of pressure, lots of people even break down since they do not know how to deal with the challenges.
9.0	While I do agree with this symptom, I don think they need to be strong.
0.0	Overall, as I mentioned above, even though there might be some peole are now less happ or less satisfied with thier lives than people were in the past since the world is changing so fast, there are always something that we can appreciate and enjoy from.
0.0	With the development, we have so much more to enjoy ourselves, even the challenges.
0.0	So I definitely think people nowadays are happier with the world changing.
3.0	Nowedays, with people's living standards continuous improvement, many problems follows.
3.0	Some parents offer their young children money for each high score they get in school.
12.0	But others disagree with this point,so do I.
4.0	First and foremost,school-age children do not have a mature adn sound consumption view.
8.0	Once they got much money from their parents, they are more likely to spend their money without any limit before they have a consideration.
8.0	They may form a bad habit of spending money.
8.0	Take my cousin as a good example.
8.0	He always have a good academic record and his parents gave him about 25 dollar for every subject that he got high grade.
8.0	As a result, he has been spending money with money.
4.0	In addition,material rewards should not be the best way to encourage school-age children to get a better performance.
9.0	Parents have the obligation to let their children know that only by their hard working,can they achieve good grades in examinations.
9.0	And marking efforts in study is all for their own choices of their future.
4.0	Last but not the least,parents' behavior of offering money for their children's each high grade in school maybe will make their school-age children get misunderstand that grade or mark.
8.0	It is the most valuable standard to measure their academic performance.
8.0	They have an alternative to tell their children that the process of acquiring weighs more and they always understand them during the way of learning.
8.0	Such as, the frequent communication and participation in their children's learning activities.
1.0	All in all,I think parents would better not offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.
1.0	Instilling the right idea of learning and how to use money is what parents should do.
3.0	Many people have their own dreams since humans existed.
12.0	And people's dreams might be differed with each other drastically.
11.0	Some of their dreams are ambitious, while others might be more realistic.
11.0	In my opinion, we should have some more realistic dreams.
11.0	This is because realistic dreams can make us more moticated compared to the ambitious dreams, they let us focus on the things we need to deal with recently.
12.0	Also, the great ambitious dreams might be easier to achieved by attaining many relative small realistic dreams.
5.0	First, the realistic dreams can let us be aware of the goals we need to accomplish in the short time, through which we can be more motivated and encouraged.
8.0	On the contrary, the ambitious dreams some times might be too far away from us, having to much gap so that we mgiht be confused on the process of persuing them.
8.0	Taking my younger cousin for example, he used to dream of becoming the astronaut when he was in the junior high school.
8.0	Such an ambitious dream he had that his parents once took pride in him.
8.0	But actually, he didn't know how to achieve that, also he didn't know how he could find the channel to approach that.
8.0	Thus he had no targets and were occupied by variety of non-sense things everyday.
8.0	Now he has become an adults, living in a small town like other ordinary persons.
5.0	Second, we should be aware of that the great ambitious dreams are always achieved by attaining many small, even tiny accomplishments.
8.0	This is what we should pay attention on, we will not accomplish anything if we don't begin with realistic and small dreams.
8.0	Taking myself for example, I major in the design, I can still remember when I was in the college,  I had made the decision to be admitted in the ACCD in LA.
8.0	The goal might be a little far and ambitious, but my professor told me that I should divide the big goal into many small, realistic goals.
8.0	With his guide, I have planned the specific goal everyday, dicided how many sketches I should make everyday.
8.0	Than I could feel that I made the progress gradually.
8.0	Finally, two years later, I was admitted into that famous college.
8.0	As I dreamed of.
1.0	In conclusion, we should start the big goal by beginning with small and realistic dreams.
1.0	Only by this way can we be aware of what we shoud do.
3.0	The truth is very important in any relationship.
11.0	Some people think that sometimes we should not telling the truth with each other, because they think sometimes the truth will hurt other, but some people claim that it is neccessary for us to telling the truth, because this way can let us get close with others.
11.0	Personally, I believe that we need to telling the truth with others in any relationship, because the truth of things will let us believe each other.
5.0	Firstly, it is great chance for us to teliing the truth to our parents, because the parents is very important.
8.0	For example,when you telling the truth to your parents, your parents are very busy, they don't have time to accompany you.
8.0	They will think about whether they need to change their schedule to stay with you.
8.0	If you don't tell the truth, they will not know.
8.0	So your parent and your will have geneation gap, but if you tell the  Secondly, telling the truth for your teacher is very crucial, because your teacher will know how to help you.
8.0	For instance, if you have math problem, you asks your math teacher immediately, the teacher can know  which part you need to focus.
8.0	This way can let you learn more knowledge and did great job in math test.
8.0	However, if you don't tell the truth  to your teacher, your teacher will not know which part you don't understand.
5.0	Lastly, it is opportunity to tell the truth for your friends, because this approach can let your get close with each other.
9.0	When you have some troubles in any area, like life, study or feeling, you can share with your friends.
9.0	This way can let your friends konw they are very important in your heart, so you can get truth friendship with them.
2.0	In conclusion, I think tell the truth with each other in any relatinship is very improtant, because it can let us get the truth friendship, get close with our parents and learn more knowledge.
3.0	Doing physical exercise is absolutely a healthy and comfortable way to relax.
12.0	The biggist benefition is that exercise can cultivate our taste,give us a good mood.
12.0	During taking some outdoor exercise,watching the natual secenary like prairie,road and rivers can easily lighten the pressure,and exercise in these locations makes you unload your brden fast.
12.0	Moreover,shouting in the process of the running or biking makes it easy to relax,in the meantime,physical exercise can enhance the metabolism,strengthen the body.
8.0	During this process,every cell in your body is willing to wake up and updating,every kind of bad mood is being transported to outside.
8.0	The combination of  real physical change and mental change in your body might be much more useful than the mental change by watching movies and read books.
8.0	Futhurmore,physical exercise gives you a satisfaction that completing an enormous job.
8.0	Nowadays,people more and more concentrate on keeping fit.
8.0	Physical exercise can give you a good method to keep fit.
8.0	After running for half an hour or completing some exercise,you might think that this lind of exercise help me reduce my fat.
8.0	Sometimes when you feel like unable to do anything,the satisfation of  keeping fit can certainly give you a positive thoughts.
6.0	As for me,I tend to run for an hour when I feel depress or hold a negative thinking of myself.
8.0	During the process,I would like to shout besides the lake and release all my unhappiness,after the exercise,I feel that I throw away all my burden and can study again,evern with a fantastic good mood.
8.0	Physical exercise can not only let us hold a stronge mental and health advantages,but also let us face the trouble directly.
8.0	This kind of relaxing should be advocated.
8.0	Ina word,doing physical exercise is much more useful and helpful than relax by watching movie and reading books.
3.0	Nowadays, many universities students have the history class even though their majors are not the history.
3.0	And the govwement claims that all of the universities students should take the history classes.
3.0	However, many students are not satisfied about the statement and they think that it's no need for the colledge students to receive the history education.
3.0	Moreover, the class may waste time of study.
11.0	Nevertheless, in my opinion, no matter what our major of study is, it's necessary for the university students to have the history classes.
5.0	First of all, taking history courses actually doesn't waste much of time for the university students.
8.0	As is known to all, there are only several lessons of the history in the table of the all courses of the students whose majors are not history.
8.0	And also, in the first and second years of the university, the students don't have many courses to take.
8.0	The time is enough for the students in the university to take the history classes in the first or the second year.
8.0	Students will not be worried about the waste of the time because of the history classes.
10.0	Additionally, history is the centre of a country and we are responsible for learning them even the university students.
5.0	Finally, people can know about much knowledge of the history which can help the study.
8.0	Actually, many inventions of the modern society come from the exploration of the history books.
8.0	Moreover, almost all of the majors are from the past, too.
8.0	People may find useful knowledge from taking the history classes of the major.
8.0	For example, the Nobel scientist, Tu youyou, used to read the history medical books of the treatment.
7.0	With the sense of the history, she finally find the medicine of the original to secure
12.0	In contemporary society, the content of the work tends to be more varied and complex.
12.0	Many people be eager for facing more challenge and others hold an opposite idea.
12.0	In my view, I agree that most workers would feel satisfied easily when that confront different assignments in their work.
6.0	Firstly, I rhink that it would be moe challenge for workers if they have to deal with many kinds of missions every day.
8.0	They will face comething that may be new to them, therefore, they have to find a way to overcome the difficultied.
8.0	As a result, after paying a hard work of the task, they usually can get achievement from their jobs and motivate them to accept next task.
8.0	My cousin has the similar experience.
8.0	Her first job was a regulators of buses.
8.0	The primary task of this job was to monitor the bus drivers .
8.0	But sometomes, she was assigned other kinds of mission that she was given more right manage the operation of buses company.
8.0	This was totally challenging for her because she did not have any relative experience of this.
8.0	However , with the help of other senior coworkers, she can manage the operation successfully in order.
8.0	Consequently, she was satisfied with her work and excited to confront next challenge.
8.0	If she hadn't accpeted these challenge, she would not have achievement now.
0.0	Secondly, it is a good wnvironment for workers whilethey have to deal with different types of contents because they can learn muce knowledge frome the new challenge.
0.0	If the job requires only repeated tasks routinely, it will have less chance to learn new things.
0.0	On the other hand, different missions can providea beneficial environment that workers can improve their professional skills and gain experience fro
3.0	As technology progresses, an increasing number of innovations and advanced modern products exist in the world.
12.0	The basic requirments from people can be easy to satisfy, such as network communication, appointing flight tickets and so on.
11.0	Therefore, in my opinion, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years.
5.0	Initially, the basic transportaions have been improving.
8.0	Nowadays, because of the traffic jam and the larger amount of public transportation, people are more willing to use the transportation like subway or bus, and even the maglev train.
8.0	For example, the government in my hometowm funds so much money on the improvent of public transportation.
8.0	In the recent years, the several lines of subway have been come out, which covered the major places in my city.
8.0	Since the existance of the convenient transportation, the travel habits of people have been changed.
8.0	According to this situation, there will be more people use public transportations insead of cars in the future.
5.0	Moreover, people' ideas towards the cars have changed.
8.0	In the past, people thought the car could be a symbol of their status and poverty in the society.
8.0	However,as  the quality of people' life are getting better, the basic requirment are not just limited in the personal satisfaction.
8.0	People are more concentrated on the environment.
8.0	S
12.0	Nowadays, there are many teachers like to make students do group projects.
11.0	Many people believe that when students do a group project, they will more lazy to work, and relay on other one.
12.0	However, I totally argue that people can learn more from team work, and it will more effectively for students.
5.0	Firstly, work with friends can consolidate knowlegde .
8.0	When you disscuss with other, you will learn more compeleted things that you did not hear in the class.
8.0	No teenager can spent handurd percent time to consentrat in the class, so after school , they will miss some key piont.
8.0	They are hard to find the answer, however, if they had team project, they can diccuss with each other, and shareing their information.
8.0	For example, I had Economics course this term, I need much time to understand many theories, I always review those things for long time, and hard for me to recieve many information at the same time.
8.0	Teacher found this problem, so she usually assign projects with other students, so I had some friends in this class, also when I had some issues, I will quickly to ask them, we do the project really fast than do it own, we all have some flaws, so we can fix each other during the group work.
8.0	Finally, I more willing to learn Economics.
5.0	In addtion, work with students will have more motivation.
8.0	All the member work, you will join it easily.
8.0	It is undeniable that many students hate math, it is so boring for them, niether I.
8.0	I never consentrat in the class, and always do my own things.
8.0	However, people will change.
8.0	Take me for example, my math grade is really terriable, I want to give up learn it before, but my teacher saved me.
8.0	He assign classmate to do the team work, at the beginning, I did nothing for this team, the reason is that I cannot do, it is too difficult.
8.0	After many times, I changed, all the students work, and they always let me to do some question, make me more useful, so I be pushed to work.
8.0	I felt motivate when I work with my friends, and I tried to learn it, it is not that bad finally I think.
8.0	Team mate influent me.
8.0	If I do it by myself, I will not work.
2.0	When teacher assign grop project, it can improve students a lot, and more effectively than before, peers can more easily influence students than themself or parents.
12.0	I agree with people today  are more willing to help the struggling strangers, the whole socility is supported by peolpe hlep people,  for the people who hard wok, alot people will help them to achieve the project.
7.0	If nobody help the struggling stanger, the socilitty are lacking a big part of talents, also it's hard to fight for your goals,
3.0	In this modern world, everybody would like more money.
3.0	But is there a connection between the quality of education to salaries of university professors?
11.0	I strongly believe that there is a connection between the salaries of professors and the teaching level, giving the university professors more salaries means giving them more opportunity and better teaching environment, and therefore will give students a better education.
4.0	What if the salaries for university professors increase?
8.0	One result is that more highly - educated people will be willing to become professors.
8.0	It is a fact that graduated students compare the salaries of jobs to choose what they want to become, some students will not consider being a professor because the salary is too low comparing to other jobs.
8.0	For universities, raising the average salary means more people will be willing to become a professor, and with more people there will be more choices and the universities can find better and more suitable professors.
4.0	Nowadays, some professors go out to find other work in order to get more money for their family.
9.0	Imagine a professor only teaching, and another professot made his or her schedual full by not only teaching, but also writing books to sell, charging students for tutor and doing projects to get money.
9.0	They will not have that much energy to teach, even if they are good teachers.
4.0	Moreover, it is well known that money is a powerful way to drive people to work harder.
8.0	When I was small I hated playing the piano, my mom used to give me pocket money after piano lessons, so I got really excited whenever there's a piano lesson.
8.0	This also applies on adults, and the salaries can be given in other ways, such as giving money to whichever teacher the student like best, or the teacher with the best class average score.
8.0	Psychologists proved that this workes, and therefore I support the idea of giving money to those who work harder, to give those who didn't get the prize to do better.
0.0	All in all, spending more money on salaries for university professors is helpful to improve the quality of education.
0.0	This is primarily because nowadays people want more money, and more money can get better things in return.
0.0	Giving more salaries to professors will encourage people to become professors, reducing part - time jobs that takes energy, and drives professors to work harder.
0.0	For these reasons, I believe that for the sake of education of future leaders and future elits in every field, it is
3.0	Nowadays, movies and television influent a widespread range of people in the world.
11.0	With the strong storm of the videos, young people will also be infacted.
12.0	They will behave the roles and behaviors of the movies and telesion programs.
11.0	So this kind of the behavior actually produce more nagative effects than positive effects on the young people in the world.
5.0	To begin with, the movies and televisions will teach the bad behaviors to the young people.
8.0	In order to show the real life and thinkings of the people, or to ferret out the cruel society, the director of the movies will add the violent and some other bad things in the movies.
8.0	The young people actually can't self-control really so they will be be infacted by the bad sections of the movie so they will immtate the terrible scenes in the play.
8.0	Concequently, they will be trapped into the hell.
5.0	Then, the movies and televisions will distract the young people and they won't pay attention to their study.
8.0	Some movies are so fansinating and wonderful that the young people will not forget it and think the most brilliant scenes over and over.
8.0	This will lead to a phenomenon that the students will not concentrate on the study but consider the movies.
8.0	One of my friends like the mavel movies and he likes the iron man.
8.0	When the latest mavel movie comes out, he will spend all time seeing the film over and over again.
8.0	After the class, he will also ask other students the questions of the iron man.
8.0	At last, he have no consciense to study and he didn't go to the university he dreamed of.
0.0	Last but not least, the movies and televisions will waste money and time of the young people.
0.0	Young peopel in the society haven't settled down.
0.0	It's so luxious for them to watch the movies and televisions.
0.0	Movies and televisions take up the most of the time in their life.
7.0	And they
3.0	How to work more effectively is a highly-debated issure nowadays.
3.0	Different people may contend various ideas.
11.0	Some people may think that people work in a group can be benefical.
11.0	However, others consider that working alone is more effective.
12.0	In my point of view, it is more effective for students that work alone on projects.
5.0	To begin with, students who do the work by himself can have a more quiet environment.
8.0	If students work in a group.
8.0	There is a unaviod disscussion between groupmates, so there must be a lot of noise.
8.0	Acoording to authoriy's reserch data, indicating that people in a quiet space can easier to focus on one thing, and most people who stay in a enquiet space will be disturbed by noise, and they can only get fifty percents concentration on their work.
8.0	Therefore, quiet space is significant for people.
5.0	Secondly, students work in a group usually take risks that getting lower grades.
8.0	Sometime, people are forced to have a group with strangers, including some free-riders, they just wait for the results, even most of time they chatting  something for fun.
8.0	Fortehmore, there also some people who do not like the topic of reaserch, and they complain all day which will have a negative effect on the group's atmosphere.
8.0	In some bad situation, the negative energy of these people will insect others.
8.0	As a result, all the people in the group have no motivation to complete the assignments, and then get a terrible grades.
0.0	To conclude, students work alone on the projects is better that work in a group.
0.0	They are not adults, they hard to control themselves when they work with others who have the same age with them.
0.0	Therefore, students will be easily interfered by others or giving up the projects and playing with groupemates.
0.0	That really waste a lot of time, Which is very precious for students.
3.0	In recent years, more and more adults casually deal with their money.
3.0	For instance,  many young women will buy whatever they like on the Internet stores regardless the prices and their salary.
11.0	Therefore, it will surely lead to no deposit for them to deal with the future.
11.0	In my point of view, however, in order to become a financially responsible adults, we are supposed to learn how to manage our own money when we are at young age.
4.0	As we know, childhood is one of the most crucial periods of a person, during which a person will form its values of the world.
8.0	Therefore, when we are still children, we should develop a good habit of managing money.
8.0	Take myself as an example, when I was 6 years old, my parents will offer me 40 yuan per day to deal with my 3 meals.
8.0	At that time, I began to plan my all kinds of buget and manage the money with the plan, so that when I was admitted to the university, I can succeed in managing much more money than 40 yuan while many students around me always use up their living fare at the beginning of a new month.
4.0	Morever, if we start to learn how to manage money when we are kids, it is more safe because there are less money in our hands as a kid.
10.0	On the contrary, if we have grown up and still don't know how to deal with money, nobody knows how much money will be waste .
4.0	Finally, knowing how to deal with money is also a necessary qualification of person.
9.0	Not everyone can make so much money as the Bill Gate or Steven Jobs.
9.0	Therefore, it is an important skill for us to make a living.
2.0	All in all, in my opinion, we should know how to deal
3.0	As the population of human growth each year, more and more couples having problem about how to educate their chidren.
11.0	Some parents believe that kids should be well behaved without making mistakes on everything, while others hold the perspective that children are able to gain experience from their mistakes.
11.0	In my opinion, children are ought to make mistakes.
4.0	First of all, mistakes can not be avoid.
8.0	As all we know, everyone will do something wrong nearly everyday, even adults sometimes make mistake by accidents.
8.0	Therefore, punishing children who make mistakes seems not fair.
8.0	For instance, when I was four years old, my mather asked me to hold a bowl of rice for her; however, I broke the bowl because I did not expect the bowl to be so heavy.
8.0	My mother did not blame me for that, she said I did not do it on purpose.
8.0	After that, I remembered that a bowl of rice weight like a huge rock, so I use my whole strength to hold it ever since.
8.0	For the above reasons, parents should forgive their kids when they make mistakes.
4.0	Secondly, when children learn lessons form mistakes, they will have a deeper impression because they tried.
10.0	In schools, teachers usually let students to do practical work after teachers teach them the theory.
4.0	It is the same when the young make mistakes.
8.0	Even if a child do not believe parents' words about what they should not do, they would quickly understand if they tried and failed.
8.0	My uncle told my cousin not to play with electricity, but my cousin did not listen to him.
8.0	One day, my cousin put his thumb in to the plug, he was shocked by the electric current and sent to the hosipital.
8.0	My uncle told me that my cousin would never get close to the plug after he retrieved.
4.0	Last but not least, parents who allow children to make mistake usually have a harmonious relationship in their family.
8.0	Teenagers are usually curious and rebillious, so they seldom follow their parents' words.
8.0	Teenagers usually do things that their guardian prohibit them from, and when their parents find out, parents would only accuse them for doing it.
8.0	As a result, their relationship get worse and their children still do not listen to them.
8.0	In this case, if their parents allow them to make mistakes, they will turn over when they fail or hurt themselves, and they would follow their parents with out having conflicts with them.
0.0	All in all, permit children to make mistakes is vital in parenting.
0.0	It helps parents to be strongly bonded to their children for not following parents' words seems unwise after children make mistakes.
0.0	Children can also benefit that they can learn lessons from it.
12.0	I think this is a good idea.
8.0	Parents offer the more money for their school-age children,it's use improving their indipendence and management of money if they theach their children to profit money reasonably.
8.0	On the controry,children may want to more money and try to get it by the unormol way,even sometimes they will argue with parents,or stole money from parents or somewhere else.
8.0	So just parents have a good education and a tempered attitude,it will be ok.
11.0	Firstly,I will express my opnion that I don't agree with this statement.
12.0	I think watching a movie and reading a book are both good ways to release press.
11.0	Which way you choose just depends what you need.
5.0	You know different poeple have different ways to relax themselves.
8.0	If you have just done so much work,and feel very exhausted,you may just want to sit in the sofe and watch a movie you like or listen to some relaxing music.
8.0	If you have much press and want to relieve yourself,maybe a more fierce way suits you bettter.
8.0	You can run,jog dance and son on.
8.0	Just  do much exercise,and you willl feel happy at the same time you feel tired.
8.0	Now I will give you some examples about how I relax myself.
8.0	Memories come crowding in,when I recall that period of time.
8.0	It had been a long,dark and hard time before I took the final exam.
8.0	I worked reallly hard but I still failed so many times.
8.0	I felt depressed and upset sometimes.
8.0	So as a consequence,I realized that I needed to seek for a way to relax myself.
8.0	So on the one hand, I listened to Taylor Swift's songs which really gave me much comfort before I went to bed.
8.0	Accompanied by the music,I felt the beauty of the world.
8.0	It seemed that at that moment,the world became silent and I could hear my inner heart.
8.0	That's cool.
5.0	Besides this,I also tried another way.
8.0	For instance,I did physical exercise,such as jogging,running,dancing.
8.0	It helped a lot.
8.0	When I was sweating,I felt relaxed.
8.0	Doing physical exercise made me feel much better.
8.0	So from my own experience,I can draw a conclusion that both ways can help us relax.
8.0	What you need to do is yo find a way that suits you best.
3.0	Recently, there is a heated discussion regarding that nowadays, grandparents cannot provide useful proposal for their grandchildren.
3.0	Attitudes toward this problem vary from individual to individual.
11.0	In my opinion, I tend to agree that our grandparents still are useful and helpful advice giver in some cases.
12.0	Reasons and examples are listed below.
4.0	First of all, even though our grandparents are unable to understand every things, which may be totally different from that in past, some tranditions and constoms are unchanged like  tranditional festivals.
8.0	Thus, children possibly know or can recognize more electronic devices such as AI robort and iphone cell phone than their grandparents do, but they can't know all what we need to pay attention of all festivals.
8.0	For example, my grandfather are obssessed with investigating the tranditonal festivals of ancient China, so when I was about 6 years old, he asked me some mythes about the 'nian' in spring festival; At that time, I didn't know anything around 'nian' so that I could not answer any mythes to my grandfather.
8.0	After while, he told me the answer and then recommend some books for me to read.
8.0	I thought these were very useful.
4.0	Moreover, our grandparents, actually, can give us some useful advice about how to get along with our friends, because they have experienced ,any different matters in their life, making them have enough experience to tell us how deal with some problems between friends.
10.0	For example, after I fought with my best friend in playing basketball, my grandmother told that I should apologize to my friend, if not ,I would lose my best friend.
4.0	Admittedly, our grandparents possibly cannot know every thing nowadays, and even cannot give useful advice to all problems, but they still are able to learn something new as we do; thus, sometimes after learning these new things, they can give us useful advice.
10.0	For example, my grandpa are buried himself in how to fix the computer, and he also give me some important information about my computer experiment.
7.0	I have to reaffirm my view that our grandparents ,actully, can give us some u
12.0	Nowadays, as the stress of competition becomes severer and severer, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people: whether it is necessary for us to know what is happening around the world, even though these events are none of our business.
11.0	In my opinion, I hold the view that we should know what is going on in our stage.
5.0	Firstly, obtaining news can get creative ideas from any news.
8.0	Based on the fact that we are in a changable  imformation world, if we cannot get new ideas, we  are unable to think about issues in new perspect.
8.0	In this situation, when in an interview of a company, the company will not employ the people who cannot put forward fresh ideas to help the company advance.
8.0	In a project of a professor, the tutor don't want to give a pass to some one who don't have the capability to think creatively.
8.0	For example, last time, when I participate in a college project,  the professor had a discussion with me about the SiO2 materials.
8.0	I put forward my opinion that we can link the SiO2 materials to luminous material according to an unreluctant news that one college students creat a luminious glass.
8.0	As  a reward, I got may essay printed in our campus newspaper.
8.0	My own experience told me that we can get many creative ideas from the unrelated news that is at first glance.
5.0	Secondly, knowing what is happening around the world can prevent our selves from out of lines.
8.0	This is because of the fact that many things are none of our business, but they can make a difference in our daily life without our awareness of it.
8.0	May be we notice that the celebrators' perspect towards the future industries changed today, we can use it in ten years.
8.0	Who knows the future?
8.0	Sometimes, if we don't notice the news, we may out of lines.
8.0	For instance, I have an uncle, who failed in investing to electronic commercial industries.
8.0	Many years ago, he wanted to invested this kind of advanced industry.
8.0	However, he devoted to another industry which was popular in that stage.
8.0	So he fails to follow the step of  the age.
2.0	To sum up, I think it is essential to keep gaining what events are happening around the world.
3.0	Despite the rapid development of society, education is no more than a commonplace.
3.0	Recently, an interesting question has aroused heated discussion: Should teachers expose their social views to students during the process of teaching?
3.0	Some people think teachers' social and political views is also a kind of instruction.
11.0	Others claim that teachers would better only impass knowledge and not influence students' political views.
11.0	From my perspective, I agree with the statement that teachers should make their social or political views known to students.
11.0	My reasons are as follows.
5.0	To begin with, expostion of teachers' political views is kind of instruction to student, which leads to students' forming political conceptions.
8.0	It is a common phenomenon in my city that students are busy with their study tasks whole days with intensed nerves thus ignoring the knowledge of policy which is significent after graduating from school.
8.0	On the contrary, if the teachers expose the political views on specific things in the society, students will form political conceptions.
8.0	With the political knowledge, these students can paticipate actively in the conditions like voting for the leads of the city and affecting other important decesions which influence the future of the city, which is beneficial to both the development of the city and individuals.
5.0	On top of that, teachers' social views can prevent students from affecting by harmful views.
8.0	Becasue of the immature mental condition, adolecents are not able to identify the harmful views in the society.
8.0	They are likey to be influenced by the wrong views without protection and instruction.
8.0	However, teachers social views can play the role of correcting wrong views.
8.0	Knowing the political views of teachers, students are prone to compare different thoughts of policy thus finding the harmness of the wrong views.
8.0	For example, when I was in middle school, my math teachers liked to show her political thoughts of peace in classes, which prevent the thoughts of violence to influence students because students' comparing different thoughts.
0.0	Admittedly, there are some disadvantage of showing political views.
0.0	Because when teachers' political views are different from views from parents or the mainstream of society, the students will become confused, which is not good for personal development.
0.0	However, it also has some advantages like aftering reviewing different kinds of views, students are more likely to have they own conception of policy and society.
0.0	To put it into a nutshell, I agree that teachers should show their political or social views in the classroom.
8.0	I agree with the statement that it's better to relax by watching a movie or resding a book than relax by doing physical exwecise.
8.0	There are three reasons for it.
8.0	The first thing why you need relax need to be confirmed.
8.0	Are you just tried of doing something for example a long trip？
8.0	So just need to relax your body.
8.0	Or you have spend a lot of attention on somethings that need use brain just like preparing for a series of exam.
8.0	You need to relax you mind in this case.
6.0	In any kind case of these ,doing physical exercise is not the right way to change you mind.
9.0	Watching a movie that softly slowly,can reduce the worry of you .
9.0	And many movies have great pictures ,maybe you can see many rarely sight just like arura.
7.0	You can addicted
3.0	With the fast development and pace of the society, workers begin think about the job.
11.0	Someone wants a well paid job but heavily workload, someone wants a job which has modest salary but less workload.
12.0	For me, I prefer take a workload job that I need to meet much of problems.
11.0	Because different tasks will increase my enthusiam ,and I can gain more experiences from the task than those work with doing the same work.
5.0	First, different assignment can promote the efficiency of their work.
8.0	People will feel boring if they do a similar thing everyday, the change of work will instimulate their motion.
8.0	For example, I have a friend named Tony.
8.0	After he graduated from the school, he choose a easy job which design a chart for his customer, but after several days, he feel the job was totally boring, so he did the job  without hardness.
8.0	But everything changed after he got a task, he needed to redesign a logo for their company, he did it quickly in 3 days.
5.0	Secondly, employees can learn new knowledge from the task with different type.
8.0	Because different type of works mean different field, worker could learn other's field through the tasks.
8.0	To illustrate, my best friend williams major in chemistry in the school, but he needs learn advanced math or phyiscs when he works, because a chemisit need to take a formula to produce a new substance.
8.0	So, after he quit the job and take a new job to be a teacher, he teach so well in scientis.
0.0	Finally, although someone say that doing similiar jobs can save a lot of time, people can use these time to do what they want to do, such as playing with friend or watching a movie.
0.0	I think it is good idea, but I think improing of ability is the most important part in our age.
0.0	People can incease the abilities by doing different task.
7.0	that ,a
3.0	Recently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate during the students:whether the teachers should be paid at least as much as doctors, laywers or business leaders are paid.
3.0	Opinions vary from person to person.
11.0	Some hold the opinion that the teachers should not be paid that high salary.
11.0	However contrary to this point is my perspective that the teachers should be paid in a salary as high as doctors, lawyers or business leaders.
11.0	My point can be elabrated as follows.
5.0	First, as we all know, the doctors, lawyers and business leaders are paid a high salary for these people are rare.
8.0	You need to be talented enough and spend a lot of time studying and practicing before you become a real doctor.
8.0	The teacher is also like this.
8.0	If you want to become a good teacher, you need to get a good grade in your final test of high school and go to a good university.
8.0	And if you want to teach students in a university, you even need to get a doctor degrees.
8.0	After graduted, you cannot become a teacher at once.
8.0	You have to face many tests before you enter a school.
8.0	You need to spend nearly the whole first year just listen how other teachers teach.
8.0	Then you can become a real techer.
8.0	For example, my father is a professor in the THree Gordes University.
8.0	He graduated from the WHU when he is only 19 years old.
8.0	After he became a doctor of physics, he also spent half a year to prepare for the class and listen to other professor's lessons.
5.0	Second, the teacher are important to the whole society.
8.0	As we all know, the students nearly spend 12 hours in the school.
8.0	So in some ways, the children even spend more time with their teachers than their parents.
8.0	And also, we all know that the teacher no only teach the students about the knowledge, they can also become the leader to the students and help the students become a kind and selfless person.
8.0	Contrary to the view, if the teacher is not paid in a high salary, there will be less people with good quality who want to become a teacher.
8.0	And fianlly, it will influence the children's quality and then influence the whole society.
2.0	Owing to the point i have mentioned above, the teachers should be paid in a high salary.
3.0	The grade is the essential composition in the school-age children's life.
3.0	There are no parents who don't like the children with high grades in  exams.
3.0	The high mark of exams can encourage children to work hard and give them more confidence.
3.0	Some parents give children money in order to give them motivation to work harder and keep the excellent performences.
12.0	In my opinion, this kind of action has different effection to children with various charactor.
6.0	According to the psychological studys, the positive reinfordences can make the subjector do better such as the money here.
8.0	For the children who have less interest in study, the money can contribute them study.
8.0	If the child gets great mark ,this reinforce should be kept.
8.0	Because it have been the important thing that support him,which maybe bad for the children.
8.0	It would be worse if the children couldn't use money in appropriate ways and even waste money.
8.0	Whereas, for the children who are willing to study and can find pleasure from study, giving money isn't good method because it will change the children's attitude to study.
8.0	Their motivation of studying will become the exterior motivation rather than the interior one.
0.0	Therefore, offering children money has different effects on different children.
0.0	But all students need the positive encouragement from their parents.
0.0	The parents should teach the correct way to use money to children.
10.0	They can also give books or toys that is good for the children's growth,which is better to replace the money.
3.0	With the development of the world, people are begining to enjoy their lives.
11.0	Happiness is an important part of lives.
11.0	As long as we feel happy, we can countinue our future.
10.0	When it come to the statement that people are less happy or less satisfied with their lives than people were in the past, I strongly disagree.
6.0	Firstly, now people's living standards improve a lot than one in the past.
8.0	People once did not have enough money to live in the world.
8.0	They needed to work for a long time everyday to save a little money which just satisify them having food or clothes.
8.0	They even did not have time to relax themselves because man in a family should save money to feed the whole family.
8.0	They can not get happy.
8.0	However, now they can calm down and spend some time to enjoy their life.
8.0	Women can go shopping or drink coffee with their friends.
8.0	People try to find more way to release their pressure.
8.0	For instance, people will take their families to travel another places in order to having fun.
8.0	So people have money to own happy life.
10.0	Secondly, the advantage of the technonlogy in the w
3.0	"As a saying goes"" different strokes for different folks""."
3.0	Some people may consider it is better for children to choose jobs that are similar to their parents' jobs than to choose jobs that are very different from their parents'.
12.0	However, I hold the oppose standpoint.
11.0	Because I have several reasons to hold back my opinion.
5.0	First, children will have more freedom.
8.0	If children select the job which is similar to their parents, most of their parents will involve much with their working.
8.0	For example, my mother was a teacher, and I chose to be a teacher.
8.0	One day, when I invited my students to come to my home, my mother was incited by my students' closer relationship to me.
8.0	She thought it meant that the students were not respecting me.
8.0	So my mother shocked to my students and taught them how to talk to thier teacher.
8.0	My students were so afraid that I felt they were not willing to have a close relationship with me.
8.0	However, I think it was a really normal thing.
8.0	So after that I talked to my students and communicates with my mother, it was so difficult and trivial !
8.0	Since my mother was a strict teacher, so she did not want to be close with her students and wanted to remain authority.
8.0	So she would impose her teaching style to me, and even she did not want me to be friends with my students.
8.0	So I think if the children's jobs are different to their parents, their parents will not constrict their children's working stuff.
5.0	In addition, children can be more independent.
8.0	When I strated to become a teacher, I relied everything to my mother.
8.0	Like I cannot complete my students homework, so I will assist to my mother to finish.
8.0	If I have some strifes to other teacher, myt mother would help me to solve the problem.
8.0	Then I felt I cannot live without my mother.
8.0	Therefore, have a different job is really important.
2.0	Granted, choosing jobs that are similar to their parents' jobs is easier to success.
10.0	However,
3.0	It is a frequent practice for numerous parents to offer their school-age children money to praise them for high grade.
3.0	Obviously,this phenomenon has brought enomious controversy.
11.0	As far as im concerned,i sustain parents to do so.
5.0	Firstly,children,especially school-age student,are too immature to realize how imporatant the study is for their future development.
8.0	Its parents duty to assist them in this monetary way,which is a simulation of future gaining if they study hard right now.
8.0	There are few effective way for parents to encourage their kids to study ecpect money.
8.0	Since i was a child,sometimes i wish to obtain some actuak cash reward while my parents insisted on mental motivation.
8.0	Thus,this waycan be helpful for children to learn the consequence if they do not waok hard in more efficient way, when their siblings can gain pocket money after achieving higher scores in school.
5.0	Moreover many universities are using scholarship to encourage students,which is a similar way,and it turns out to be sustainable with positive effects.
8.0	when parents are using realy money to motivate their children,they are under huge pressure of misleading.
8.0	Pearsonally,there is nothing to worry about,because curious children who are eager to gain the reward and not be disappoingted.
8.0	At the same time,thisprocess is a simple resemble of the real sociaty,where people with higher scores or more intelligence with get better jobsand cosiderable salary.
8.0	it is better letting children to konow this.
1.0	Finally ,theworryabout the unsustainability of this incentive mothod is unnecessary.
1.0	After children have realized the benefit they can obtain from studing hard,theexternal motivation will be gradually transferred into internal maotivation,and this wont happen backwards.
7.0	In other words,thehypothesis of the money incentive creating long time positive effect will come true in some children cases
3.0	There is an increasing concern on whether the ability of arrangement ,or in other words, leadership is endowed with or not.
3.0	People form diverse backegroud hold mixed views on it.
11.0	As far as i am concerned,  desipte that those may have advantages of being a leader if they have talent in this aspect, it is possible for those without the talent to be  excellent leaders.
4.0	First of all, it is not a matter of being a leader but a good leader who has the ability to convince the group members and creat sense of belonging to the members if you say a person has leadership, which requires your perseverence.
8.0	Imagining you are working in a company, you must have a leader.
8.0	He may be an experienced manager who you worship very much.
8.0	However, there must be some new learders who may leave a negative impression on you at the begining.
8.0	But this is how the company works, the seniors leaders teach the fresh leaders how to guide the team.
8.0	During this process, a fresh leader can turn into a sophisticated manager,too.
8.0	I would like to illustrate it by giving an example of my collegues, who become my leader two weeks ago.
8.0	She entered to the company one year ago,and we just didi the same thing.
8.0	Thanks to the cultivation of our leaders, i witnessed how she learnt to bear responsibilities and how to became the core of our team from a freshman in the career.
8.0	Thus, leadership can be cultivated if you want to and you insist to it.
4.0	Adittionally, even for those who are born with mastering leadership, they have learned this from their parents or teachers.
8.0	If you are talented in this aspect, your teacher may let you become the monitor of the class, and your parents may let you arrange a family tour, which enrich your experiences of how to be a good leader.
8.0	This can be proved on myself.
8.0	I am regarded as a leader when i am in elementary school.
8.0	My teacher give me more chances to practice myself.
8.0	Some times i did something wrong, the teacher would teache me patiently.
8.0	Noting having provided this, no matter how talented you are, you may be a unacceptable leader in your class or in your group.
4.0	Admittedly, a person who masters leadership naturally can be a good leader easier, but he still needs to learn from some experiences to be an outstanding leader.
10.0	And there is no doubt that everyone can learn to be a leader only if he wants to be.
1.0	To conclude, not everyone is so fortunate to have leadership naturally, but everyone has the chance to learn how to be a leader.
1.0	Only if you can persist and learn from the daily experiences, you can be a leader.
11.0	I agree that people today are more willing to help the struggling strangers.
12.0	Help others always be seen as a wonderful thing.
12.0	I can see some examples just in my daily life.
11.0	I think this might have four main reasons.
11.0	First reason, in my opinion, is the progress of our income.
12.0	Most people have the kindness to help others, but just a few have enough money in the former.
10.0	Becides, less people pretend to have trouble to cheat money, couse a vituous cycle.
6.0	Second, I think progressing of the rule of law might be another reason.
8.0	We can't know the character of the strangers, we will usually wonder if they cheat us.
8.0	With the law I think the third reason might be the development of technology.
8.0	Most people will know if some one is struggling deal to the internet development.
8.0	It can make trouble on one side and support on the other become true.
2.0	Last reason, I think might be the development of the education.
3.0	In the modern society, life is not very simple.
11.0	These are a lot of things aroud us, especially the younf people.
11.0	Some people think that young people suppose to have a ability to plan their own thing, but some people cliam that the ability that young people need not have to organize.
11.0	Personally, I believe that it is neccessary for young people to have the ability to organzie their own, because they will be more clear to know their goal.
5.0	Firstly, young people can save more time if they know how to plan or organize their time.
8.0	The person who gets succeed, they must be have a certain list when they need to do some certain things, because this way will be not watse thier time.
8.0	Also, they can use rest of time to do some things that they like.
8.0	Conversely, if the young people have not that ability to control their time, their time could not be very flexible than people who have that ability.
8.0	For example, people who work the art assignment, and the due day is sunday afternoon.
8.0	They  can make a list before, when they want to finish that assignment, and afther that, when they hand in before sunday afternoon, they can do some other things that can make them relax or learn more knowledge.
8.0	Therefore, they are not only finished the assignment earily in the week, but also they can have more extra time.
8.0	This is because they have a plan.
5.0	Secondly, it is a best way for young people to have a ability to make a list, preparing eventhing before they want to do, because this way can let them make more friends.
8.0	For instance, people who are in the young people's meeting, so there are a lot of young people in there, and they are the same age.
8.0	However, if  one of the young people have some capability that others don't have, he or she will be very different from other poeple.
8.0	So that more and more young people want to make friend with him or her, because everyone wants to make frined with excellent  and outstanding people.
2.0	In conclusion, from my point of view, I believe that it is significant that young people tp have a ability to organzie themselevs, because they can have addition time to do other things that they like and making more friends.
3.0	Surely, entertainers and athletes are more famous in youngsters than in older people.
12.0	While walking in the street, you can often hear some youngstes talking about the insterests of the entertainers they like and they may also pay attention to this insterests.
12.0	But the older people won't do this because the entertainers are less attractive to them and they can be less influenced.
5.0	First, sometimes youngsters cannot see something clearly.
8.0	When they are under this condition, they may just follow the entertainers they like.
8.0	For an instance, two stars are arguing for what should be done in a movie.
8.0	Then the fans of these two stars will also argue to protect their idols, this phenomenon are very common.
8.0	The fans of a star will just believe their idiots because they like it.
8.0	Even if the fans cannot understand things clearly, the will fllow their idols without duobt.
8.0	But the older people won't do this because they have experienced enough so they don't want to join in this arguement, and the stars cannot have great influence in the older people.
5.0	Second, youngsters' methods of entertaining are totally different from the oldre people since they may spend much od their time on their idols.
8.0	And from time to time, they may think their idols' ways to deal with things are right because they admit their idols form bottom of their hearts.
8.0	Take woman fans for an example, they may talk what make-ups are used by their idols and how the idols make his or her skin looks skinny and beautiful.
8.0	Then they will take the same measures as their idols.
8.0	So the result is that when the idols explains their opinions they will just stand the same ide with their idols.
8.0	Nevertheless, the older people won't spend much time in appreciating others, they may just go to work and back to home or do some sports.
8.0	Then the entertainer cannot effect them.
1.0	Last, there are differences between youngsters and older people so the opinions cannot effect them strongly, since most etertainers and athletes are youngsters instead of older people.
1.0	And the older people will just apperciate the albums or the races of their idols when the idols were young and they will spemd less time paying attention to the stars, less than following their opinions.
3.0	The issue of the opinions of celebrities is a highly debatable one.
11.0	Some people hold the view that these opinions are more important to younger people while others think otherwise.
12.0	Though some people contend the improtance is nearly the same between people of different age, I strongly believe that younger people would value the opinions of celebrities more than older people.
5.0	Firstly, the thinking format of yonger people and older people are different.
8.0	Younger people haven's formed a firm thinking format and would be more likely to absorb new ideas.
8.0	On the contrary, older people, because they have already experience plenty of things, they have already formed a thiking format and would be strongly convinced of it.
8.0	On the basis of these firm thinking format, absorbing new opinions would be difficult.
5.0	Moreover, younger people have a better access to those celbrities, which is of benefit for them to attach importance to the opinions of celebirties.
8.0	People like famous entertainers or athletes are fashionable persion, and they gain more popularity with younger people.
8.0	On the other hand, older people know little about these fashionable person.
8.0	Take my grandfather and my cousin for examples, my cousin knows athletes like Messi and Kaka, but my grandfather even don't know what these people do.
8.0	Under the circumstances that younger people have a better access to celebrities, it's obvious that their opinion are much more important than younger people.
10.0	Finally, even though some po
3.0	Recently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people: whether it is better for classmates or colleagues to communicate face to face than through emails in order to do a project?
11.0	Opinions vary from person to person, some people claim that sending emails to do a project is better.
11.0	However, I would stand on their opposite side and I believe communicateing in person is better.
12.0	My viewpoints can be elabprated as follows.
5.0	Firstly, communicating in person can get more accurately informations and details.
8.0	while people are face to face, they can have an oppotunity to exchange their thinking accuratelly.
8.0	People can really see the expression and hear the mood of each other, and then they can realize and analyze the point  accuratelly.
8.0	If people communicate by sending emails, they could just see the words on the screen.
8.0	They would be more possible to have a wrong understanding in the information.
8.0	This would delay the process of project.
8.0	For example, when I was in high school and we had a contest of science.
8.0	Our group decided to measure the speed of gravity, so we discussed the details of experiment after school.
8.0	All the members gave their own suggestion and we made the best plan quickly.
8.0	Finally, we got the first prize.
8.0	However, other group choose the way that communicated the experiment by sending emails did not got prize because they met errors in emails.
5.0	Secondly, discussing the project face to face is more efficient than through emails, and it can save the time.
8.0	In today's busy life, people are always very busy and often foget to check the emails.
8.0	So if people want to commucate the project through emails, they would face the risk of missing the emails.
8.0	If people discuss the project in person, they would supervise each other and get the result quickly, which can save much time.
8.0	For example, my sister was going to take part in the design contest, and her group sended her emails to discuss the details of contests.
8.0	However, my sister only checked her emails once a month.
8.0	In the end, her group failed because of their group handed in their work too late.
10.0	All in all, I think dd
3.0	Nowadays the economic crisis has been a topic for many people and it causes a topic that in order to reduce the expenditures,which kind should be reduced: police, library or public transportation.
3.0	This topic has divided people into three different camps with opposite opinions, and some would like to hold the opinion to reduce the expenditure of library or transortation.
12.0	However, when it comes to me, I prefer reducing the expenditures of police, and there are some reasosn and examples that can illustrate my opinions.
5.0	First and foremost, with the economic crisis, people will just put more energy in work in order to maek more money, then less criminals will be there.
9.0	To be more specific, since with the economic crisis, people will have less money as payment but they still have to pay for their food or gas fee, so they will just spend more time to find more jobs or just work harder, then people just have less energy to rob or do bad things, then in this way less police will be needed so the police can just be reduced.
9.0	In opposition, if there is still many police, the government have to pay for the salary of the police, and the police will not be busy but be free for most of their time since there are not many accidents waiting for them to deal, then in this way this kind of expenditures can be a waste.
5.0	In the second place, economic crisis makes it possible for the criminals to know that they don't have much chance.
9.0	sicne the biggest problem the police has to deal with is caused by thieves or robbers, but since it's economic crisis, the thieves or robbers know that there are not many chances since people will improve their ability to prevent robbing in order to decrease their living expenditures, then in this situation, thieves or robbers will just turn to find a job since in this way they can earn more, so the police will be less needed.
9.0	On the other hand, if the government spend the money on library, then people will have a better to study and their education degree will be improved, then the economic crisis may be solved more quickly since people are able to help the country get out of trouble by the knowledge they have acquired.
0.0	Granted, it may be reasonale and attractive that some people claim that the government should decrease the expenditure of library or public transportation, since with the economic crisis, people will be more likely to stay at home in order to save money, so the library or public transportation are not necessary.
0.0	However, it can not hold water, since people will just be more inspired to make money when ecnomic crisis comes, so people will need the library to hold a group meeting and they will take the public transportation more in order to find a chance to invest or find a job.
0.0	So I am still convinced by my standpoint that the government should decrease the expenditures of police.
11.0	I am not agree with this statement that young people in nowadays have no impact on the improtant decisions that could determine the future of society .
12.0	Although, there is no denying that today's teenager do have a lot to learn to practice to experiment.
12.0	However, the young generation plays a very significant role the urban society.
12.0	Here are my following reasons.
5.0	First, everyone of the successors were go through a time when they were just a teenager.
8.0	Some of them become famous when they were young and have a lot influence on the society.
8.0	"For instance, a movie star or famous young singer who have a lot of impact on the whole world, they have millions of fans, they have fans to follow, what they do and say can affect many of there fans, like when a famous young singer say:""We should protect the world form the global wariming.''"
8.0	I think many of his fans would follow his idea and do something for it ,transport an twiiter or having a speech on public train station, nomatter how tiny they did, when there is a group, a population fundimental , it became strong.
5.0	Moreover,for a second reason, the teenagers in nowadays have new idea and new thought of almost everything.
9.0	They are much more creation compare to elder people,Take my friend Lisa as an example, her parents are both business man, however, her famliy had a financial problem last year, her parents couldn't afford the debt they have and they have no idea how to make more money in the resources they have,  Lisa decide to help her parents about it.
9.0	She suggests her parents to put all there money and resources into online business, one that her parents never heard it before, and in a miracle of time, this year they made a lot of money and finally paid all their debts.
2.0	So basicall,the young people in nowaday will have more influence and more useful to this society than the old ones, more than we'll never know.
10.0	And the decision determing the future of society is holding in our hands.
3.0	With the severe competition in the society, the public pays more attention to the students' behavior in the curriculum and their abilities.
12.0	So some people hold the view that students should work alone on their projects in order to cultivate their independent spirit and problem-sovling skills.
12.0	However, I contend that the students should work together, the reasons are followed.
6.0	In terms of the studying consequence, working together is contribute to a better result.
8.0	Firstlly, studying in a group means you have more acccess to find out the solution, which is starkly efficient and advantangerous.
8.0	Imagining you are encountering an obstacle in your marketing research paper, if you are working on your own, maybe you will be stuck in this problem for several hours and still have no idea.
8.0	However, if you are working with your partners, when facing the problem, you could have a quick brainstorm, which is conducive to the sparkling perspectives.
8.0	Secondly, studying with others provides you more opportunities to check out the ignorance in your projects.
8.0	Everyone will have different thinking patterns, and this is beneficial to the checking part.
8.0	When the project is finished, you will check the content back and forth.
8.0	However, if you are accomplish this task alone, you are more likely to think in only one pattern, and this way is time-consumig and problematic.
8.0	If you are working in a group, you could assign the project into several part, then everyone take charge of their own part, it
3.0	Nowadays, an interesting discussion has arisen among the public: which career should people choose?
12.0	Following an ambitious dream or focus on achieving realistic goals.
12.0	From my perspective, I choose the latter one undeniably.
12.0	Here are the reasons I will explain.
5.0	Firstly, realistic goal is practical that people can make a detailed arrange.
8.0	As is known to all, everything starts from scratch.
8.0	To those people who want to chase their dreams, they have to make sufficient preparation.
8.0	A realistic goal is often accompanied with former experience and matural methods, whereas to chase an ambitious goal, people often have to deal with lots of unrealistic problem, which is hard for people to make a detailed arrangement.
8.0	For exemple, my uncle, a successful businessman, always focuses on a practical business.
8.0	He never tries to achieve any ambitious business, which is hard to make a percise plan.
5.0	Secondly, it is easier for people to abtain success if they choose realistic goals.
8.0	As I mentioned above, the realistic goals are easier to arrange.
8.0	It is also easier for people to abtain success, because the work for these goal is not challenging and people can follow the procedure patiently.
8.0	For exemple, many employees who have ambitious dreams are willing to challenge themselves to do marvellous projects.
8.0	When they are actually engaged in these projects, many of them are confused about the procedures and the direction of their progress.
8.0	So to make sure that one could finish the task and achieve the goal, it is better for him to choose a realistic goal.
10.0	admittedly, an ambitious dream seems appealing to people, however seldom people have made those dreams come true, at the same time, the feeling of failure will distroy the spirit of them which may result in more serious problems.
1.0	Taking everything in a nutshell, making a realistic goal is essential for people not only because they could make a detailed arrangement but aslo for a easier way to achieve success.
1.0	And making a realistic goal could make sure one would not make more serious mistakes.
3.0	In this day and age, some parents tend to praise their children's grades by using money since they will work harder in order to get that money.
11.0	However, from my own point of view, I do not regard this as an understandable behavior.
11.0	My opinion will be amplified by the following reasons.
4.0	First and foremost, money-praising method may be harmful to students.
8.0	This ia mainly because parents cannot control the flow of money, leading to students spending on smoking or even drugs.
8.0	This is extremely harmful not only to the student himself but also to the whole family.
8.0	A salient example of this can be seen in my friend's experience.
8.0	His academic performances were extremely perfect so in order to praise him, his parents gave him a large amount of money.
8.0	He studied in Harvard and during the summer session, he chose to study five courses only in two months.
8.0	So under mounting pressure, he had to rely on drugs.
8.0	But taking drugs spent him somuch money that he could not even afford the tuition in Harvard and now he dropped out of the classes and worked outside.
8.0	As the instance reveals, using money to praise children can lead to terrible consequences.
4.0	In addition, students may not work so hard in the future if their salary is not so satisfying.
8.0	This is largely due to the fact that students during their junior and senior high schools may depend heavily on their parents' money so if they could not land a great job that meets thier requirements, they will not pay much attention to it.
8.0	For example, one of my friends had abundant money when she was still a child since her parents would reward her by money.
8.0	But after she grew up, her abilities could not fit with her education, so many companies refused her.
8.0	She had to work in a small corperation where she could not get satisfying salaries.
8.0	As a consequence, sometimes she could not even meet her own needs, not to mention the heavy house rents in China.
8.0	Therefore, it is not a good idea to provide money for students if they get high marks.
4.0	It is true, to some extent, that it is a motivation for students if they get rewarded.
8.0	However, parents can offer them other choices to be rewarded, such as travelling.
8.0	My sister likes to travel, and every time she goes to a new place, she will gain.
8.0	Hence, she now is hired by a multinational corperations where she designs the front cover of the magazines.
1.0	In conclusion, students should not be rewarded by money, not only because it is harmful to them, but also due to the fact that it may influnence their future work.
1.0	If parents really want to reward them, they can take their kids to travel to enjoy the beautiful scenes and broader their horizons.
12.0	Most people would say that students should not take part time jobs while they are studing in the universuty.
11.0	I agree that in some cases, students should not take part time jobs before they get in collage.
9.0	After all, my brother was didn't take part time jobs before he get in the collage, but he still did a good job on collage.
9.0	However, in my opinion, students should get some part time job before their get in collage.
4.0	First of all, part time job can helps students to get some work experience because they need to have a privious experience about job, this can helps students find a better job.
8.0	For instance, my aunt who is living in America, she'a got doctor's degree last year but she still can't find a good job.
8.0	She've been looking for many companies and attended their interview.
8.0	She was refused reason is didn't have enough work experience.
8.0	Actually, when my aunt was graduated from senior school she always perpared for her university  materials.
8.0	Her mom told her she should be attend some part time job to get some work experience but my aunt didn't do that.
8.0	Thus cause she can't find a good job.
4.0	Secondly, to do some part time jobs can give students more choice.
8.0	Maybe some students didn't good at study but he or she though part timt jobs fins that he or she have some talent on other subject, such as finance, fishion design and painting.
8.0	Thus they don't neet to worry about they can't find a good job when their graduated.
8.0	For instance,  I saw a news yeaterday which is mainly about a man didn't have university diploma but he still get a good job in Wall Street.
8.0	Because the man was do some part time jobs before he get in university.
8.0	He was work in a coffee shop and he responsible for accounts.
8.0	Because he have a talent on finance thus he also helped his boss to manage money matters.
8.0	His boss earn lots of money because his help.
8.0	After that the man decided to major in finance so even he had a bad grade he also can find an ideal job.
8.0	He have an extra choice.
4.0	Lastly, to do some part time jobs can help student skill their communication ability because they need to community with other people and need to be naturally.
8.0	Thus this is a good oppotunity to omprove they diffus skills.
8.0	Supposing you are a senior students and you are prepar to go to university, but you can't communicate with other people.
8.0	So you decided to do some part time jobs to improve your communicate skills.
8.0	For a long time yon communicate with others and your communicate ability also been improved.
2.0	To sum up these, there is an argument that students should not be allow do some part time jobs before their get in university,getting work experience, providing more choice coupled with improving social skill, make a strong case that students should attend some part time jobs before their get in university.
3.0	Throughout the history, everything has two sides.
11.0	A same thing, could both be helpful and harmful.
11.0	On the one hand, this offer could make their child more productive and willing to study.
12.0	But on the other hand, the money might make the children have a false value about study and work.
11.0	In my opinion, I belives parents offer their school-age children money for their grade are harmful.
4.0	First of all, we all agree that life is vary difficult these days.
8.0	Parents works for hours to get their pay to raise their child and support the family.
8.0	This is their responsibility to do so.
8.0	For the school-age children, it is also there duties to study and do their homework.
8.0	Parents should not offer their children money just because they did thier jobs.
4.0	Another reason that I think this is not a good idea is that we live in a material wrold, if the children get the extra money, they mostly going to buy things that they don't need.
10.0	Parents should encrouage their children to manage their money properly instead just offering money to their children as an reward.
4.0	Alongside the reasons I mentioned above, I believes that children should kown that it is hard to make money.
10.0	Otherwise, the children will have a false value toward money resulting them wasting money.
1.0	Above all, it's a well-established fact that parents offering school-age children money for their high grade is not a good idea.
1.0	Only if the child gets money througth his own effort, he will kown how to manage them and what money means in real life and only in this way do th kid kown how to save money on his own, instead of just asking his parents for money.
3.0	Parents use money to encourage school-age children to get high grade is not a good idea.
5.0	First, high grade does't mean everything.
8.0	This kind of strategy is equal to tell children that get a good grade enrais make more money.
8.0	That will drive those children to a dangerous thought.
8.0	They will ragard grade as the most important issue in their world.
8.0	And too the money can give them the meaning of life, which is definitely wrong.
8.0	There may be two disadvantages to do so.
8.0	On the one hand, They may ignore that there are so much wonderful things in their life, such as love, friendship, art, curiosity, games, and other skills they should have to learn in their childhood.
8.0	One the other hand, they may get the reward by any means and some of them are unbehaviable, like lies and cheat.
8.0	One cheat may destroy a good child's whole life.
8.0	So this kind of encouragement is too rick to try.
5.0	Second, the grade do means something.
8.0	But the award has not to be money.
8.0	Parents do need to encourage children to focus on the study, and try more harder to get a higher grade.
8.0	But their are multitudinous methods to achieve this goal.
8.0	First, grade itself can be seen as a kind of award.
8.0	Parents should teach children the significance of good grades.
8.0	Second, parents can use other things, not just money, to rewards children's high grades, like instrments, vidiew games, movie tickets and so on.
10.0	Finaly, I think that is  a bad idea, a
3.0	Have you ever seen that some people go to foreign countries and beome more friendly and optimistic?
11.0	Some people in the society believe that people benefit more from going to their own countey for trip than from foreign countries.
11.0	When it comes to the opinion that peoplewill benefit more from foreign contries than own countries, I strongly agree.
11.0	There are three aspects that help me to illustrate my idea.
5.0	Forst of all, people can deeply understand other countries if they travel to anther countries in person.
8.0	For instance, my English teacher has gone to many foreign countries, like America, Engliand, Franch and so on.
8.0	Also, she is really different from some prople who have never been to another countries.
8.0	That kind of people may always boast their own countries or addmire other cultures without any basis.
8.0	Instead, if students ask my teacher about foreign countries, she will anwser the students according to the real situation about that country.
8.0	Because she has been to these countries in person, she can realize what these counries really are.
5.0	Second, some people believe that travel in their own country will feel more familiarand have less trouble, like language and jet lag.
8.0	However, I think there are more benefit if people go to foreign counries, like improving the interpersonal ability.
8.0	For example, my brother was a really shy person and he prefer to stay at home rather than hang out with friend even on holiday.
8.0	But after he travel to other counries, he became a kind and friendly person.
8.0	I asked him how to do that.
7.0	He anwsered me that if people went to another counries, people must t
12.0	First of all,i think today people may not willing to help the struggling strangers.
12.0	the reason are three    First,now people are too busy to waste time on others because once they spend time on others they may come late for work,this will bring bad influence for the.
12.0	And the people that they helped could not give them benefit,it says get more kicks than halfpence   Second,today's society is an information age.
12.0	many information will send to people's hand,it means people are becoming busy and busy,they may not willing to abandon their time to help others.
8.0	For example,while you are asked to send a file to another company,on the way to the company.
8.0	"You see an old man tumble on the road,at the same time,the boss call you and ask:""why haven't the documents been sent yet?"
8.0	"where is it?"""
8.0	Then what do you need to do?
6.0	Third,more and more people think help the struggling strangers would take troubles for them.
8.0	course of the recent topic said about this, Should a fallen person help or not?
8.0	about why has this topic ,It is about a story,after a man help a fallen person,the fallen person told others is the man who help he makes he fallen down.
8.0	fainlly the helper lose money course of this.
8.0	after that ,many people think it is better to save trouble,so i think it may have less people w
12.0	In my opinion, parents should let children make mistakes and learn from their mistakes.
8.0	Learning from ones own mistakes will make deeper impression.
8.0	For example, if a child was hurt by a sharp knife, they would realize that the knife is really dangerous and keep these painful memory forever.
8.0	"When they see these kind of dangerous things again, they will know ""I should be far away from this""."
8.0	In another hand, if parents just warn their kids repeatedly, it may aroues kid's curiosity and then cause terrible result.
8.0	The experience from mistake are valueble.
8.0	Children can learn a lot from their mistakes.
8.0	Only they go through these process by themself, they know how to deal with the similiar problems next time, and these are their parents can not teach them, because everyone's experience is different, nobody can predict what will happen on another person.
8.0	Parents always tell their kids do not fight with others, but almost none of them really understand what is their kid facing, this can not solve the problem.
8.0	Maybe after the kids have fight with others, they will know fighting is not the best way to fix the problem with friends, then they would not do it again.
3.0	With the development of communication and transpotation technology, the sense of distance could be decline because of convenient social software and public traspotation.
3.0	Thus it's common for people to get approach to some area or meet people that we can't in the past.
11.0	As a result, people today have various chances to know and hlep stuggling strangers, and I totally agree that they are more willing to do that.
5.0	Firslty, newly developed technology porives us opportunities to know about others who living in different circumstances like us and their difficuties.
8.0	Take one of my uncle as an example to illustrate, he knew about some homeless chidren lived in a poor  area are in need of teacher for basic education from a repoter on the website.
8.0	Then he decided to going to that vallige and become one of teachers there for three years.
8.0	If there's not such media to report that thing.
8.0	how could my uncle give a help hand to those poor but hard working kids?
5.0	Futhermore, since people nowadays have recieved higher education than those who in the past, thet could easier make their living or afford families.
8.0	As a result, there' s lot of spare time and money could be put into helping others.
8.0	That means, when sharing resouces with people who work hard, not only their own lives won't be influenced, but they could bulid tight friendship with those people.
8.0	Then, they may get feed back after those man success on the base of their helps.
0.0	It is universally acknowledged that people in mordern society tend to concentrate more on themsleves than people around.
0.0	However, it dosen't mean people are unwilling to foucus on others.
0.0	Based on the improvement of life quality and thcenology, people have more resouces and method to know and give help to struglling strangers, and they get benefits and sense of acheivement from it.
0.0	Above all, they are more willing, of course, to help  struggling strangers than those who in the past.
12.0	I aggree with the idea that workers are more satisfied when they have may different types of tasks to do during the workday than when they do similar tasks all day long.
11.0	This is based on my personal experience.
5.0	Admittedly, doing similar tasks all day long is easy for the workers and efficient for the employers.
8.0	A person doing one task learns and masters this job more easily and they can be quicker because they get more practice on one certain thing.
8.0	For a few pople, this may sound good because it is easy, it requires less thinking.
8.0	But are you still pleased with the job after doing the same work for a week, a month, or a year?
8.0	People will always get bored when doing one task repeatedly.
8.0	Although this is a quick and easy choice, it is not necessarily satisfying for the workers.
5.0	However, what if the workers are given different types of tasks to do during the workday?
8.0	I think it is even more efficient.
8.0	When I first entered high school, I piled all the reviewing job before the tests, in this way I hoped to concentrate on just one subject before the test.
8.0	However, I found it inefficient, because when I study for one topic without stop for a long time, my memory is used up and I cannot think.
8.0	With such a full mind I always get bad sleep before the test day and I cannot do my best during tests, due to lack of aleep and too much thoughts jammed into my mind.
8.0	After doing this for several times, I tried to spread the reviewing job into several days, and when I felt tired I can do some homework from other subjects to change my attention, and when I go back to reviewing I can learn more than before.
8.0	During the test, the brain is working better and the result is better than before.
8.0	I am still using this technique on my schoolwork and daily life, it is the best and most pleasant way for me.
0.0	Moreover, doing different types of tasks during the work day is challenging and creates a feeling of satisfaction.
0.0	For a worker, doing different tasks are more difficult than doing just one, because they don't get that much practice and therefore not that much experience.
0.0	They need to think: what should I do now?
0.0	What should I do next?
0.0	What can I do to become faster or better?
0.0	These are the challenges.
0.0	With those challenges the person will act more possitively, a better job will be done, and most importantly, finishing a challenge will bring a happy mood, so the workers will be more satisfied.
0.0	This is the same feeling as the pleasure of finishing a difficult math problem.
11.0	Nowadays many people chooes  traveling as their holiday plan because having a travel can relax themselves and make them more positive in their life and work.
11.0	some people choose a group travel with a tour guide while others choose to travel by themselves.
12.0	from my perspective, i disagree the best wway to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.
5.0	First , traveling alone or only with some friends is more freedom than in a group.
8.0	You can have your own plan.
8.0	Wake up on the noon and have a rest after midnight.
8.0	But if you in a group with a tour guide, the guide will set the plan already  and you will be sent to one and other famous place like a doll.
8.0	that almost limit your place of travel and make the travel like a trap.
5.0	second, you will be sent to some shopping mall and have to buy something when you are traveling in a group.
8.0	Nowadays some guides receives money from the shopping mall and they will only led you buy something in that mall.
8.0	You can't even meet something you really wants to buy.
8.0	I used to traveled in a group, and the guide sent me to some small and dirty mall and asked me to buy something they called ''qiegao''.
8.0	I never thought i would buy it but the guide told me i must.
10.0	At last, admittely have a travel in a group
11.0	For me, I don't think it's a good way to educate their child like this.
11.0	And i want to explain my opinion for the following aspects.
4.0	First of all,it's a student's responsbility to study hard and get good grades as they should know that it's their own things but not someone pushing them on the back and yelling at them,'Hey!
9.0	You should go to study!'
9.0	Once they realize it's for themselves and their brighter future,they would not need money to push them forward.
4.0	Secondly,although some schools have established some systems that you can get scholarship if you were the top ten or whatelse in the school,i still disaaprove this method in home education.
8.0	If it really works, what would the child think?
8.0	When he grows up, he realizes the truth of study is just to get money bonus?
8.0	I think it really misinterpret the essence of study.
8.0	Why should we study?
8.0	We want to chase for the truth, we want to discover something that haven't been found,something interesting that's worthwhile for us to dig it out,something that could help us develope ourselves.
8.0	So why do we need this childish things to encourage us?
8.0	As long as you realize the reason you learn?
4.0	All the things i discuss above are from the small sights,what if we look higher and further?
9.0	The country needs someone who can attribute themselves to the motherland that brought them up but not those people who could do anything if they could get money.
9.0	We could also find some high-tech talent doing bad things for the whole society or even the whole world nowadays,so it's also a problem.
0.0	What we should do is to help the kids develope a correct cogition towards the reason we study but not just giving them money as an encouragement.
0.0	Kids at school age can easily affected by their parents' behavior and even before you didn't realize the problem.
0.0	So teach your child more wisely and that may work out better.
12.0	Nowadays, a considerable of people, holding the idea that students should be awarded for their well performance in the school, claim that these will encourage them to study better.
11.0	Will, I agree with their opinion.
12.0	From my perspective, offering school-age children money for each high grade the get in school can encourage them to work hard.
12.0	Listed in the following contents, some reasons will demonstrate my opinion.
5.0	The main reason why I agree with the above statement is that money for high grades is an acception to students for their hard-working in their one-year or half-year study.
8.0	Being offered extra money by our parents means that they accpet that we have worked hard at school and they are happy about these.
8.0	So it will encourage us to try to work harder to satisfy our parents expectation.
8.0	For example, once I got extra money living expenses from my parents as an award for my high grades, I was so excited that my parents satisfied with my performence last semester and so I would try to work hard in the next semester not only to get extra money again, but also to make my parents happy.
8.0	So I gradually became a better students than I was before.
5.0	Another factor to support my opinion is that those students who are offered extra money for high grades can have the ability to eat more delicious foods or have entertainments with friends on their free time so they will be more happy and more powerful to study harder for their next extra money rewards.
8.0	And it is acknowledged that a strong willing and nice spirit can drive students to work hard.
8.0	A recent survey can back up my point.
8.0	The survey made by a university of my local town, after posting thousands of students in the university aged from 18 to 22, found that more than 80 percentages of the interviewees have the stronger willing to study just after a short vocation than those time when they have continued studying for a long weeks.
8.0	And almost all the interviewees admitted that delicious food can give them a nice spirit to study.
8.0	So more money for entertainment can drive students to study better.
2.0	In a nutshell, what we have mentioned above, when taken together, are in favor of the point that offering school-age children money for each high grades they get in school is a good idea.
3.0	Nowadays, people tend to have various ways to relax in a highly developed pace of society.
3.0	Either watching a movie, reading a book, or doing physical exercise are choices of relaxing during leisure time.
11.0	From my perspective, I agree with the statement that it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relaxing by doing physical exercise.
4.0	On top of that, physical exercise will increase the burden and intensity of body, which cannot help people achive the goal of relaxing.
8.0	Generally speaking, most people will not want to add more tensions to body after all day's work or study in order to be relaxing.
8.0	In contrast, watching a movie or reading a book will ease the body physically.
8.0	Doing exercise will even require more energy from body.
8.0	Sitting in a comfortable room, picking a book to read or a movie to watch will be easier than running and sweating.
4.0	Moreover, watching a movie or reading a book not only help to release the body, but also relaxing the mind and the brain.
8.0	Certain types of movies or books help people release better.
8.0	A comedy or love movie require less thinking of the characters or plots, so that people can appreaciate a movie without doing much thinking.
8.0	Likewise, a comic book could amuse people with funny stories, so that people can also relax by reading some funny books.
4.0	Lastly, the financial cost could be a factor when considering wether watching a movie, reading a book or doing physical exercise.
8.0	Going to a gym costs more money than sitting in a public library while reading a book or watching a movie on computer at home.
8.0	Some people would think about how much money they have spent on the gym while they were doing physical exerice, so that their mind and brain were still in an intense state.
8.0	From a financial perspective, relax by watching a movie or reading a book is still a better way.
2.0	In conclusion, taking into account all three factors, the advantages of relax by watching a movie or reading a book still outweigh the benefits of relax by doing physical exercise.
11.0	There are some ideas about who should pay for our decisions.
12.0	In the past, many teenagers supports that their dicisions should be depended parents instead of them.
11.0	But nowadays more and more people want to make decisions by themselves.
4.0	Admittedly, decisions made by parents are always providing us with a way with few mistakes.
8.0	It is because that our parents have much social experience and skills.
8.0	The more parents go through, the more correct direction they can give.
8.0	However, the correct directions is not what young people really want.
4.0	The higher education gives young people more thinkings about their determination.
8.0	In the past, people often had low education and went to outside for working at age of 16-20.
8.0	Most people could not make their own decisions with low education and experience.
8.0	So their decisions were made by their parents with more experience.
8.0	But now, the society offers teenagers a lot of opportunities of high education.
8.0	More and more people have a chance to get permission to university.
8.0	Equipped with the knowledge what they earn from universities, teenagers can make easy to decide their direction.
4.0	Furthermore, parents become more liberal about dicisions of young people.
8.0	In the past, young people are always under the pressure of parents.
8.0	Parents ask teenagers so much limitations that young people become less and less courageous to make their own decisions.
8.0	But now, parents are faces with more advanced information and become more liberal than before.
8.0	Parents would not manage young pople too seriously.
8.0	In addition, young people have more freedom to do what they want to do and make their own dicision.
1.0	As far as I am concerned, the dicisions of young people were made by their parents  in the past.
1.0	But with development of education and change of parents, nowadays young people begin to make decisions by themselves.
3.0	In modern fast-developing society, people are burdened with so much pressure that they are looking forward to having more than seven days during a week for them to have a rest.
3.0	Given conditions that people only need to work three days a week for long hours or five days a week for shorter hours, which one would you prefer?
11.0	I'll definitely choose the latter because, from my perspective, it is more healthier and could keep me constantly motivated.
5.0	To begin with, working for five days a week for shorter hours help people a whole week's schedule and live a healthy life.
8.0	As is known to all that spending so much time sitting in the office while we are working does harm to our physical health: it can cause damage to our shoulder and wreist.
8.0	Take myself for example.
8.0	I got a part-time job in a restaurant last summer and my work was to serve the customers.
8.0	I worked eight hours a day from morning to evening and there was no time left for me to rest.
8.0	After a month, I could clearly feel much pain with my back and wreist.
8.0	However, if I worked shorter hours a day, I would have had leisure time during which I could release my phisical pressure and even do exercise to keep fit.
8.0	Therefore, I prefer to work more days for shorter hours.
5.0	Second, constant working can make people energetic and motivated since there is always a goal to be accomplished the next day.
8.0	If only work three days a week, people are easily to loosen their nerves during the intervals.
8.0	Consequently, when they return to work after a gap time like one day or two days, their working efficiency will decline thus decreasing the effect.
8.0	For instance, comparing work to our students' study, studing everyday is of much importance because what matters the most is that students need to devote themselves into a study atmosphere, which helps a lot because it is more efficient.
10.0	In a nut shell, I choose to work
3.0	In my perspective，this measure is a good way to encourage the children to work hard.
3.0	The reasons are as follows.
3.0	The enviroment where our childs have changed a lot.
3.0	It means that the way of education and encouragement should be updated.
3.0	The truth is  that we can`t just use some candies or toys to stimulate the children like we usually did at the old time.
12.0	At present,our children prefer more useful award,like money.
6.0	Some people may argue that it`s too early to combined the grade with money and give the school-age children too much money may have a bad influence on their mind.
8.0	But I believe that our children are not sensible and weak as some adults think.
8.0	Most of them have stonger mind now.
8.0	They have the power to avoid the temptation of wealth.
7.0	Although we have to admit that the money given to them may cause some bad
12.0	I disagree it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than by doing gym.
11.0	There are two reasons to express my view.
4.0	first, if we do some physical exercise, we can go gym with some friends.
8.0	During exercise, we can talk with our friends, i think it is a good way to relax ourselves.
8.0	When we do somr physical exercise, we pay our all attention to exercising, then we do not have time to think about other things, we can enjor our physical exercise.
8.0	Also after doing physical exercise, we will fell very tired, if we take a shower and go to sleep, i believe we can take a perfect sleeping.
8.0	We all know, if people have a great sleep, they will feel more relax and more happy.
4.0	Second, if we go to the gym to do physical exercise, we can listen to mucic and also can watch a movie when we are doing exercise.
8.0	Doing more physical exercise is good for our healthy, if we keep doing, we will get more healthy.
8.0	Than, if we get more and more healthy, we will keep more happy.
8.0	If people always have a great time, they will not easy to be nurverse, they will can control themselves and it is more easier to get relaxing.
4.0	Anyway, watching a movie or read a book also can make people relaxing, but doing physical exercise can take people more ways to become relax.
9.0	For example, in the gym, you can choose to run, dance or yoga.
9.0	You can choose the types of physical exercise that you prefer.
0.0	For my personal example, i like go to the gym with my friends, and i feel very well after i done the exercise, i like swim, in the summer, when i swim, i feel very relax.
0.0	Also i tryed to read a book to relax myself, but i can pay attention to read, and it taked more nuverse to me.
0.0	So beause i have some experiens, i think doing physical exercise to relax is better than watch a movie o read a book to.
3.0	I do agree with the given topic that it is a good idea to offer the school age children money for high grade they get in school..
3.0	Even if they have already grown into adult or getting older,they will stll remember this by the experience of gaining award from the fabulous result that they worked.
11.0	I have 3 supporting reasons in order to support me.
4.0	Firstly,at the age of that children have no clear recongnition with the money,they could develop the thought with getting award that if they behave well in their future,whether in schoolife or get occupied,they could win the money they deserve by their hardworking.
10.0	The function of the world is that one with strong ability could get more,and this could give the the basic idea of'doing better,then getting more' in the rest of their life,in a unclear way.
4.0	Secondly,giving the children money for exchange of their good grades could let them know the importance of keep on  hardworking for a long time.
10.0	To those lucky dog who just reach the standard of being award,for the long-term profits,they will keep on achieving high grades for a long time,and it will be benificial after it becomes the habits of the children and they can develop their presistance of doing things constantly.
4.0	Finally,offering children money for their high grade could raise the ambition of them.
9.0	For an obviously example,if a boy gets 10 dollars for the award of get 85 percent in a subject,besides having the thoughts of keep on hard working,he will imagine and think if he could get more money when he gets 90 percent or even higher,and he will be movitated to do the works and his study by himself.
9.0	He will be a perfectlism on his study and being ambitious.
1.0	In comclusion, I think the type of method that give the school-age children money for each high grade in school,have a lot of benefit for the children's ability in many different aspects,even managing the money.
1.0	So I really do support this idea.
3.0	With the development of the science and technology, paretns pay more attention to kids' educational ability than before.
3.0	In this part, there is no doubt that teacher play the most vital role of this activity.
11.0	Some people assert teachers should be paid as much as or more than doctors, lawyers or business leaders.
11.0	As far as I think, I totally agree with it.
11.0	And my reason will be given below.
5.0	First, Our furture living standard depended on our kids' ability and knowledge, and cultivating chlidern are teahcer's duties.
8.0	everyone will be old, and everyone will retire one day.
8.0	If we want to using these better products or traffic in the furture, whether our childern are skillful and creative enough are very important.
8.0	Maybe couldn't have so much fancy ideas when we are 60 years old.
8.0	But these young people could have these.
8.0	If our teachers are very wise and professional, they could theach our kids so well, and we can enjoy the better life when we are old.
8.0	When our parents they were young people, they couldn't use the Wechat or Iphone, but these talented descendant create these, improve their living quality.
5.0	Second, we should be educated well in the teacher, it is the insurance of a good furture.
9.0	if we don; Although these doctors, lawyers or business leaders are very nescessary for our daily life, but most of them had been educated many basic or professional knowledge by teachers in the school.
9.0	So, these teachers are irreplaceable and unique, they are the gardeners of social elites.
1.0	Put in the nutshell, our furture are depended on these kids, whether childern are skillful enough depended on these teachers.
1.0	So teachers should be attatch more importance and paid more.
7.0	Playing computer game is regarded as a effective learning method, because audio-visual information can attract students'attention and foster their interest in learning easily.
7.0	Despite the benefits of playing computer, it is conceivable that children cannot reap benefits of their habit,parents and children should think twice before encouraging chulidren to play computer games
4.0	The first point is that play computer game interferes with children's participation in activities which are beuseful to their develepment.
9.0	it is diffcult children to carry out those interactine activities which promote brain development, such as reading, singing, and communication.
9.0	parent may also fear that students who paly computer game frequently may not be able to concentrate on learning taskd ,a problem which can cause declining scores.
4.0	Another problem is that children are less likely to participate in the physical activity ,if they spend long hours to playing computer games.
10.0	this is one reason why children become obesity over weight children may have negative self-image, which can undremine their confidence and have adverse impact on thier wellbeing.
4.0	Another criticism of televion viewing is that computer games may contain unwanted content,which cam cause forms of misbehaviour among children.
9.0	It is possible that those children who are exposed to computer games might experience aggresive and heroic fantasies.
9.0	for these reasons  children who commit the aggresive act do not experience any unpleasant feeling   T summarise, parents and teachers should impose restriction on children's playing computer games, rather than encouraging this habit.
3.0	Nowadays, in the workplace, more and more people are given more than one specific job by thier boss in a typical working day.
11.0	In my opinion, it's a good tendency, which can make the employees content and satisfied.
4.0	Occupying various types of tasks during the workday is a kind of recognition and appreciation of your work attitude and ability.
8.0	"There is an old saying in China, ""the competent man is responsible for more work.."""
8.0	If your leader believe in you, he will assign more tasks for you, which can also promote people's happiness in work.
8.0	However, if an employee has poor work performance, he must do his own work first.
4.0	In addition, doing different tasks can improve people's skills in distinct fields and dig out employees' potential and talents.
8.0	It's beneficial to get engage in different task where people can get knowledge.
8.0	Also it can increase people's sense of achievement when we are succeeding in doing something.
8.0	On the contrary, If an employee only focuses on his own field and task, his whole day work my be monotous.
8.0	He is always in his comfortable zone and deal with familiar issues.
8.0	There is limited space for self- improvement and he may stay at where he once started.
8.0	while those who challenge different tasks become more experienced and knowledgeable.
4.0	Furthermore, employees ger more satisfied when multitaking in a day's work because they contack with different people and whole new life.
8.0	In the workplace, we need to communicate and cooperate with people from whom we can learn different expertise and learn from their qualities.
8.0	It can exercise our teamwork spirit and cooperation spirit.
8.0	Thess awearness is quite significant for our career.
8.0	This also important for companies to creat a better atmosphere.
8.0	While Working in a small group and concentrate on own work is hard to cultivate teamwork spirit.
2.0	To conclude, I claim that doing different things can improve emp
12.0	These days, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debated among people: whether teachers should be paid as the same level as doctors lawyers and the business leaders.
11.0	From my perspective, it is necessary for teachers to get the same level payment since teachers can play a significant role in our morden life, My point will be elaborated as follows.
5.0	Firstly, it is fair for teachers to get the same same money as others and this policy is conductive to building a harmonious society.
8.0	On of an impportant principles of our morden society is that people who make the same effect to the society should be paid the same money.
8.0	Receiving  the same level of money, teachers will feel satisfied about their current job and devote themselves to working hard, which is the base of a harmonious environment.
8.0	On the contrary, if teachers get less monty than people in other jobs, they may think unfire and feel unsatisfied about the government.
8.0	As a result, teachers may quit their jobs or even commit a cirme like robbary.
8.0	For example, the payment of my high school teachers is low in the past, and fifty percent of the teachers quit their job to attent businsee companies.
8.0	However after the improvement of the money, mant teachers enjoy the current job and
5.0	Secondly, receiving same payments is benefitical to improving education level.
8.0	Euqipping with a relatively high level payment, they would keep a high spirits every day, resulting in teaching more energeticly.
8.0	Satisfying with the current situation, they would find scientific methods to improving their education in case of losing the job.
8.0	On the contrary, they may pay attention to personal stuffs instead of  the teaching and show slack-workding.
8.0	A research conducted by Harvard University is the case in point, in which professors divide two handred teachers into two groups.
8.0	On get the same money with doctors, lawyers and business leaders, while the other only get a relatively little money.
8.0	It turns out that ninety percent of the high level payment group shows energetic teaching performance, well-prepared slades, and high marks in final grades, while only twenty percent of the latter group shows the same results.
2.0	All in all, considering the advantages is markable, paying the teachers with the same level money is necessary.
11.0	In my opinion, i agree this point.
8.0	When a person makes mistakes and rethinks, he or she will remember this lesson and will not forget it.
8.0	There is a story like this:A lady visiting a teacher's house and she saw that a teacher under a 3 years old was clumsily inserting a key into the lock.
8.0	"The child wanted to open the bedroom door ,but due to height and coordination 6 is not enough,how can not open , the lady quickly walked to want to help him a while, but the teacher stopped that and said:""Don't disturb him, let him make some mistakes, pondering i can always open the door for a while, so he will never forget how to open the door."""
5.0	"For instance, Edison, the great inventor , had undergone countless failures before inventing the electric light, and he could make countless mistakes that eventually led him to understand the value and role of ""tungsten"" and thus invented the electric light."
5.0	Have parents ever thought that when childern make a misrake at first, they will try to correct it if they know they have done someyhing.
10.0	If parents simply  criticiza and blame your children blindly, they will only make them lose their confidence and you will find yourself a bad boy i nyour heart and think that they will never be changed.
3.0	"As Adam Smith once wrote in his famous masterpiece ""A nation gets its well-being as long as it distrubutes works to its people""."
11.0	It is to say that once people devote to and only to the work they are skilled in can the economy reach an efficient phase.
11.0	But that is only a perspective from the economist's view and it also has some flaws in it.
12.0	As far as I am concerned, I think it is not sensible to push people to do similar task all day long.
10.0	The reasons are the following.
5.0	First of all, people aren't so efficient even when they are doing the jobs that they are good at.
8.0	According to the recent research on the psychology, human's brain will get tired after performing the same task for a long time.
8.0	For each task repectively, it requires different parts of the brain to engage in the process.
8.0	Doing a similar job for too long means nothing but parts of the brain keep working while parts of the brain keep idling, which makes it more propone for the worker to be exhausted and inefficient consequently.
5.0	In addition, manipulating manifold tasks can also help the worker to learn the advantages they have and makes them less likely to get unemployed.
8.0	The workers in CTI, an electronic device manufacturer, always stand in the stream line, doing the same job like screwing the surface of computer.
8.0	So all the thing they know is to work like a robot.
8.0	Since the factory robot has already came into being and commercialized, in the future their jods will certainly be replaced by the robots because the robots are cheaper than human labor.
8.0	On the country, if their have the experinces of different tasks, their can form a better understanding of the production and get oppotunity to let the robots be their workers instead of being unemployed.
1.0	In conclusion, making the workers to do different works can make them more efficient and know their abilities in different tasks.
1.0	Consequently, they can gain more and seize more oppotunity and be more satisfied as a result.
3.0	With the technology;s progress, more and more advanced devices are spreading into children's normal life.
11.0	Some say they will make negative influence in the children's creativity, beacause some of them are so convenience for children to use without thinking.
11.0	Such as telephone, young people just need to slide theirfingers on the screen, then they will get everthing they want.
10.0	However, I have some different idaes against their points.
12.0	I think technique can really inspire children's imaginations.
5.0	In the first place, technique brings information, which also means they bring the knowledge and makes children to think more of the world.
8.0	As we know, people only can think about something when they get enough information, but children in the past could hardly get any information from outside of the world, then they could reasonablly think less than presenting children.
8.0	For example, nowadays children can know a lot of foregin comic heros by some movies such as spider man, bat man or super man, which were rarely known for the children in the past.
8.0	Therefore, many children can totally creat some heros by their own, because they can combine the straits from many heros that previous children had never seen before.
5.0	Beside, technique can immediately record the inspiration from the children, which could not achieve before.
8.0	Imagining a child had a though in the past, he just could drew it in the paper or made some drafts, but that could be hardly recall later.
8.0	Compared to that period, now children have advanced computers, which means they can record them as soon as they have a thought, and that idea will be protected completely in the computer instead of in some weak papers.
8.0	In addition, researchs from Harverd have revealed that there is a increaing numbers of creations that from the teenagers in recent years, which is double number than the quantities than in the past.
10.0	In conclu
8.0	Nowadays,I can definitely see more and more people are willing to help the struggling strangers.
8.0	There are a lot of reasons following.
8.0	Firstly,with the development of the world,people have quantities of chances to success.
8.0	However,the stress on the road to success is humorous at the moment.
8.0	every successful people know the sacrifice to make dream come true so that they are happy to help the struggling people.
8.0	Secondly,educations are becoming wider and we learn to help others and harvest happy from it.
8.0	In additions,helping the struggling people sometimes is a way for marketing.
8.0	It can improve the image of a corporation and let people to know the corporation culture.
8.0	Take the Deloitte as an example,Deloitte holds the Deloitte Club which is target to the strugging sophomore and junior students every year.
8.0	This activity help these students know more about what they will face several years later and give them more chance to excercise and show themselves.
10.0	In conclusion,the struggling people can get help from more ways,and they should take these opportunities.
3.0	Recently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate amone people that will people spend less time cooking and preparing foods than they do in the future.
3.0	Different opinions vary from person to person.
11.0	Some holds the belief that things will remain the same.
12.0	However, from my perspective, less time will be taken to cook and prepare food.
5.0	First, the future society will require people to be more efficient.
8.0	As acknowleged by all that our society is advancing at an incredible speed, and the pressure force people to waste no time to accomplish thier work.
8.0	Thus, there will be no enough time for them to cook and prepare food as the old days.
8.0	Take my grandmother for example.
8.0	When she was a young girl, she and her mother used to spent hours to pick up vegetable and clean animals for the whole family to eat.
8.0	However, we young people have got used to take meals as daliy tasks without taking much care of that.
8.0	Such as the instant noodles and fast food, it's seems a waste of time on eating so considerately.
5.0	On the other side, the market will be more abunant for us to buy foods well cooked instead of preparing them ourselves.
8.0	It's hard for our ancestors to predict the morden way to eat as they had to cultivate or caputure their food for a living.
8.0	Controversially, we don't need to know exactly how the foods become acessible, since all we need to do is drive by the supermarket, pick up what we want, and microwave them.
8.0	So I frimly believe that in 20 years, the way for human to get food will continutely advance.
8.0	As for university students of present China, we have already accstomed to have our foods deliveried through the internet.
2.0	To put in the nut shell, the way for human to get foods will definitely continute advance,not only because the society require faster lives, but the market will offer more choises for us to take.
3.0	Many are concerned about the use of time during the free time  and there is  particular concern regarding to the way of relaxing.
3.0	Some people relax by watching a moive or reading a book while other people by doing physical exercise.
12.0	Though some people contend that watching a moive or reading a book would be less healthy than exercise, there is no doubt that film and book are beneficial to your personality.
12.0	Thus, I strongly believe that moives and books would be a better way to relax, because it will help you learn something useful to your career, moreover, reading books help you shape a good personality.
10.0	Firstly,
12.0	As  for me, I really agree this statement, the ablity to relate well to people , which could be tremendous foundament of the success, further, if you hold this kind of social  source in the future, which could play an important role because only the text and acdamic knowledge that gainning from the school cannot be enough steps for the tour of success.
12.0	There are three idea support this, which are strengthening social network, widenning the horizon by going outside, some people could bring the opportunity to you.
4.0	Firstly, social network is an essential part in society determines that whether can get success.
8.0	likewiswe those successful man or experts who have seen a lot of people and have contact with them because they need these people to help to success.
8.0	For instance,  when you fall down your sale goal, if you have an excellent social interrelationship with your staff in company, they will help you solve the problem that you are facing now.
8.0	Obviously, excellent social network directly be a step to success.
4.0	In addition, you have to relate people, which means you will go to wherever they are because they impossiblly stay same place.
8.0	And you also will widen your horizon by this kind of tour.
8.0	For example, once I have a meeting with a friend who live in Beijing, afther visiting his school and his studio, I really be suprise to what I have seen because I never imaged how well are him, further I also like their local culture with curiousity.
8.0	This process is really helpful to success.
4.0	Finally, some people could bring the opportunity to your success if you have good realationship with them.
9.0	When you have already become the ture friend, they must will help you when you in trouble.
9.0	For instance, when I need some investment for a project, but cannot operate with lack of money, if my friends know that, they will help me in the this aspect as soon as possible.
7.0	In conclusion, relating  friend is a good choice to get success, which enrich a lot of part of you
11.0	History plays an important role in our daily life, expiecally throughout the education realm, but whether or not all university students should be required to take history courses no matter what their field of study is is still controversial.
11.0	Some people claim that it is not a good idea since most university students are very busy, they so not have enought time to take the course which they are not interest.
11.0	As far as I am concerned, however, I believe that all the students need to take the history courses.
5.0	To begin with, learning history will open up our mind since it can provide us a lot of intersting knowledges which we are not familiar with.
8.0	Owing to experience busy lifestyle in the high school, most university students lack of professonial history knowledge since they have not enough time to get in touch with this course.
8.0	However, in the university, students have chance to have a better understanding of history.
8.0	As we all know that the significance of history cannot be overlooked.
8.0	It not only help us to supply our background knowledge.
8.0	but also realize the outstanding of country.
8.0	In this way, those students  who are not field in history also have cahnce to know these.
8.0	Therefore, it is a good way to require all the university students to take the history courses.
5.0	On top of that, taking history cources is a good way to expand our social network.
8.0	By going to differnet courses, we will have chance to get in touch with different people, which may provide us necessary help in the future.
8.0	If we just take the course in our major, we facing with same classmate and study with each other everyday.
8.0	However, by taking the history courses, those students who are not major in the history will have a new study environment, they can commincate with those students major in history.
8.0	Moreover, when they facing some professional history problems, they can consult with them.
8.0	And in the future, the social network may also help people to solve some history field peoblems in the future career.
2.0	Judging from these evidences, we may safely arrive at the conclusion that it is beneficial for all the university students to be required to take the history courses no matter waht their field of study is.
12.0	It is said that parents should give their children chances to do things they want.
12.0	Actually it is during the process that children can learn things ,especially by mistakes.
12.0	While in some people's opinion, avoiding making mistakes makes a difference.
12.0	The both ideas have their reasons.
7.0	In fact, I concede that it is beneficial to let children avoid making mistakes in
3.0	Some people in society think about that young people must have the abolities to plan and organize.
11.0	I definitely agree with this statement.
11.0	The modern life  is becoming more and more complex, so young people need to do something to adapt to the harder life.
11.0	There are some  reasons why I feel this way: with the abilities to plan and organize, young peopple can control their time better and do more things effectively.
5.0	If  young people have the capacity to make a plan, they will get a perfect time arrangement and control their time better.
8.0	As we all know, the social pressure is getting heavier and heavier, young people need to spend more time on sdutying and working.
8.0	So a rasonable schedule is very important to young people.
8.0	It can help them arrange their work, study and play reasonably.
5.0	When young people have a schedule, they can do more things effectively.
9.0	For example, I did not like planning before so I could not review all the exams before the final exam.
9.0	However, since I learnt to plan and organize my time, I had more time to review more knowledge and I got a better mark.
11.0	I disagree with the statement that it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.
11.0	For people who likes exercise, of course exercising is better.
11.0	They enjoy the feeling of sweating and the feeling of achievability after the exercise.
8.0	We often say that exerices are good for your body,it is heathy.
8.0	It is true of course,that is how exercise is good for relaxing.
8.0	If you are mentally tired,I would suggest that doing exercise is a good way of relaxing.
8.0	Think about it,when you are mentally tired,you don't want to think about anyting,all you need is to forget everyting and do something else.
8.0	At this point, reading or watching a movie maybe is not a good choice.
8.0	You have to think through the plots when you are reading or watching a movie,this does not cure the mentally tiring.
8.0	When you are doing some exercise, you can forget all about all the work you need to do and just enjoy the moment.
6.0	I also agree that it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book is better than relax by doing exercise.
8.0	Especially when you are physically tired.
8.0	At the end of the day when you go hiking or mountain climbing,you need to rest your body.
8.0	At the end of the day, your body may feel sore and pain,so just sit in a couch, read a book or watch a movie for relax.
8.0	When you are reading or watching a movie,you can out yourself into the wonderful and magical world of the story.
8.0	Imagine that you are inside the story,how fascinating it would be.
0.0	As for myself,I perfer reading a book than exericse.
0.0	I am not a really exericsing person,but I have a lots of friends who loves exercise,they like swimming or horse riding,so I can understand a little of the feeling.
0.0	I perfer lying on my couch and having my private time alone.
0.0	But exercising is also a very good way of relaxing, maybe I will try it later.
11.0	Firstly,I suppose to agree that parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.
12.0	In our childhood,our parents will teach us how to walk,and let us to walk and then to run by ourselves,looking us behind.
12.0	When we are trapped by something,like stones,they woud say this is stones' fault.
11.0	Though parents' mind is to comfort us,but we often get the wrong massage.
11.0	As we are in this environment for a long time,we will extremely think we are right,others have errors.
11.0	Haven't have the right opinion in our daily life.
4.0	Next,if we are wrong,we should know what is right and hoe to be right,not let us have fause but not to change it.
8.0	To be a parent,it is a due to tell his kid that he is wrong,and how to deal with this situation.
8.0	Let them know this, also can help them to communicate with others in a good manners.
8.0	So others will look upon of them for this reason.
4.0	"As a saying goes""Not eveything is perfect."""
8.0	When a kid like a kid,do the things in a nauty way,they always have problems.
8.0	Which child have not do anything wrong?
8.0	Many adults will have hard things to solve,why can't child do things wrong？
4.0	Whatsmore,if a child could learn from what he has done,it's better than has a person to teach him.
8.0	It's his personal experience of his own.
8.0	No one but him could know moreabout it.
8.0	The best teacher is event itself.
4.0	So,to let child to be a child,and allow them to make mistakes,could let them know which is right and which is wrong.
10.0	It could help them to be a good person in the future,and benifit to this social.
2.0	Letting children make mistakes is better.
3.0	With the developement of tecnologies,people tend to go out for a movie or stay at home for reading to get relaxed.
3.0	From my perspective,I prefer to go to gyms.
12.0	Not only can we relax our mind,but  also can help us to relief some stress.
6.0	Admittedly,seeing a film such as a comedy or read a meaningful book is a decent way to relax yourselves,during this process we are able to gain the entertainment ,but it,s easy to be tired since you are continusly keeping thinking.
9.0	I guess you cannot really feel  refreshed.
9.0	Obviously doing exercise can really allow us to cheer up,in the duration you just focus on the movement and your mind is blank.
7.0	There are a variety of stresses around us,by doing exercise we can
12.0	I disagree with the viewpiont that students learn much more effectively in teamwork than work alone.
12.0	Here are my reasons.
4.0	First of all, teamwork will mentally release the pressure and lead to the result of distracted attention.
9.0	Students may think that when any problems occur, there are always team members to help them.
9.0	However, if they are assigned to work alone, they have to rely on themselves all the time, which urges them to think much more.
4.0	In additon, as we all know, teamwork provides the opportunity of getting away from individual duty.
8.0	In a Chinese story about monks, less than two monks would have water to drink, but three monks wouldn't.
8.0	Why?
8.0	Because no one wants to do more work than others.
8.0	If unfortunately the members are lazy students, they can not have the activity to finish the teamwork.
4.0	Last, working together means breaking tasks.
9.0	In theory, every team worker only shoulders parts of the whole obligation and need no to care about the other tasks.
9.0	Obviously, they can not learn as much as students who solve all the problems alone.
1.0	All in all, I do think that working alone on projects gives the best opportunity for students to learn complementary knowledge.
1.0	To be honest, this may be harder and slower in effects which can be saw from the surface, but students will learn real konwledge once they finish the tasks alone.
12.0	I believe that the topic is controversial ,we should consider this topic dialectically.
8.0	In one hand,we have to consider why some parents offer thier school-aged children money for each hign grade they get in school.
12.0	Of course,both parents and children regard it as bonus.
12.0	In some extents,it is a truly effective way to increase children` grade and encourage them to study harder.
8.0	We have to understand these kind of origin goal.
8.0	Parents always want thier children be better,from primary school to university or college,beacause they believe start would decide the end,good jobs only depend on high diploma ,so parents can`t help to push their children harder and children have to get higer grades in school.
8.0	tTo parents,they are correct ,they are totally responsible for thier children.
8.0	That is the right and reponsibility our parents deserved.
8.0	In that situation,offering money may not be a bad choice.
2.0	In another hand,we should also consider for our children.
8.0	Parents are even willing to offering money for high grade,wo can imagine how much pressure our child have to face.
8.0	According to my experience,children have to finish thier homework  to almost 12 pm,even later,and have to get up 6 am.
8.0	I
12.0	Many are concered about how to apply a correct teaching modes among teachers and there is a particular concern that whether teachers ask students to finish assignments together or just one student accomplish by himself.
12.0	From my standpoint, I consider that colarborative group could benifit students better becasue of several reasons.
4.0	First of all, the student in your team could help you to figure out the problem which is hard to you.
8.0	For instance, I major in Computer Science and once teacher asked us, formed a 4 student group, to bulid a program by language C. I am good at write language codes, however I nearly can't build up the framework, which is the basic step for a program.
8.0	If I were along, this homework would be impossible for me to accomplish.
8.0	But a friend of mine taought me how to work out this problem and he entirely instructed me how to apply by hands to hands.
8.0	Because of the group work, I really benifited a lot and that made sence.
4.0	On the other hand, group work means more effective because each student of the group can finish one part of the assignment , then combines all parts together.
8.0	Imaige one person finish a work cost 8 hours per day and last about fortenight.
8.0	What about another person join in the work.
8.0	These two guys, also work 8 hours per day, only need one week to finish the assignment.
8.0	In additional, one add to one sometimes even equal to 3 and 4, that is the function of colarborative work.
4.0	In conversely, people who work alone may lose their passion, they feel more and more bored and have no aspiration to work out a diffcult problem.
9.0	Accordingly to a recent study, If someone else has a competition to you, you will feel more confident and all things you want to do is beat him.
9.0	Therefore in a group projects, some students are better than you, you aspire to beat them  and work hard to gain more knowledge.
1.0	In conclusion, the group mode for student is a better mode in education for three mainpoints.
1.0	More effective, More passions and More gains.
3.0	Now a day.
3.0	Students also have different opinions than teacher.
3.0	If  i in a class, the tearcher says something that different than me, i would like to choose untile the class over, and all my calssmates gone, and than talk to he about my opinions.
3.0	There are some reasons why i choose to do in this way.
3.0	It can keep class all inthe rails.
3.0	I also can keep tearchers's diginity in front of classmates.
11.0	And i also can think my opinions more clearly and persuasive.
4.0	To beginnig with.
8.0	I choose talk to teacher after class, because i can keep the class in the rails.
8.0	If i talk  to him in the class, i might interupt class countinue.
8.0	And in this way, all the classmates in this class will affected by me.
8.0	If i talk to him after class, the classmates in the class can normal proceesd.
8.0	And i can haver more time,deeply talk to him how i feel.
4.0	In addition.
8.0	I can keep teachers's diginity i front of classmates.
8.0	For intance.
8.0	There is a student figure out teacher's mistakes in the class, all the classmates laught at the teacher.
8.0	Teacher also lose his face and  feel very akward.
8.0	In the end, the problem be solved, but the tearcher lose his diginity.
4.0	At the end.
8.0	If i talk to my teacher after class, i can consider the problem deeper.
8.0	If i talk yo hime in the class, it just my little opinions, it may not has too much evidences to support my i idea.
8.0	But, if i talk to him after class,  i was deliberate , i can find more ideas to support me .
8.0	And also, i can hav e more time discuss this with my teacher.
0.0	To put in a netshell.
0.0	If i have different opinions than my teacher , i wpuld like to discuss with hime after class.
0.0	It can keep calss
12.0	For this prompt, it discussed the parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.
11.0	I agree with this topic because it is important for the children to learn how to do the things correctly.
4.0	To begin with, the children always make mistakes.
8.0	The parents cannot stop them to make mistakes.
8.0	When the children make mistakes, some parents will to help their children to solve the problems, but some of them will not do this.
8.0	I command  the second way to let the children themselves to sovle the mistakes.
8.0	For example, if the children did the homework at a wrong way.
8.0	They can get the correvt answer by thinking of the correct way.
8.0	If the parents to help the children to do the homework, then the children cannot do solve the problem correctly forever.
8.0	So, the parents should let the children deal with the problem by themselves.
4.0	Secondly, correcting the mistakes can help the children to develop their intalligence.
9.0	For instance, when they make some mistakes and nobody to help them, they will think about the resolution to solve the mistakes.
9.0	If they do so, they might be not doing the same question in a same wrong way.
4.0	However, if the children make a big mistake, the parents should not let them to solve by themselves.
8.0	This is because the children are too young to deal with some big questions.
8.0	For example, the children broke a bowl.
8.0	For this situation, the parents should help the children pick up the pieces of the bowl and tell them how to deal with the similar problem in the future.
8.0	It can help the children to develop their abilities.
1.0	In conclusion, I think the parents should let the children to deal with the mistakes by themselves.
1.0	It not only can learn from the mistakes, but also could improve the children's abilities.
3.0	As we all know, people soon get bored if they keep doing the same tasks for a long time.
3.0	When face with various missions, it is easier for people to obtain a great sense of fulfillment after accomplishing everything.
3.0	As far as I am concerned, i strongly recommend workers to do a variety of tasks everyday instead of the similar tasks all day lond.
12.0	My reasons are as followed.
5.0	To begin with,  different tasks enable employees to refresh themselves and thus ensure the work efficiency.
8.0	Adult as we are, it is easy for us to get tired of the same repetitive work everyday.
8.0	Taking school teacher as an example, it is said that most teachers will become tired of their job in the hope of quitting it.
8.0	However, these teachers are as energetic when they started to teach as it is their ideal job.
8.0	I believe it is years of same teaching content that brings the tiredness of most teachers.
8.0	On the contrary, if workers need to cope with various of things in their work, they will find it more interesting and be more willing to get involved in their work.
5.0	Secondly,  shorter and easily finished tasks can give works a sense of accomplishement.
8.0	For instance, I will feel happier and more satisfied with myself at night if only i do lots of things in the daytime.
8.0	Time is limited, every moring, i will spend some time making a to do list so that i will be aware of my tasks.
8.0	If there are something which is not time-consuiming and easy to finish, it will be my top priority.
8.0	In other words, i contend that workers gain joy from accmoplishing their jobs.
8.0	If this job will take them a whole day, they will mostly be reluctant to do it.
0.0	Last but not least, working on one mission for all day long will reduce worker's positivity.
0.0	It is said by some scientits after several experiments.
0.0	therefore, we should avoid giving workers the same taskes .
0.0	In this way, not not the workers can become more excited and easy in doing their work, the bosses will also gain benefits since they may receive less complaints and have a higher work efficiency.
11.0	Many are concerned about how the celebrities have influence on the different age of people,there is particular about whether the celebrities are more important to younger or the oledr people.
12.0	I agree with that celebrties like famous entertainers and athletes is more essensial for the younger genaration.
11.0	And there are several reasons below.
6.0	Firstly,the celebrities can inspire the younger to be more competitve.
8.0	In today's society there are many young generation working in different workship and also the younger are more active than the older people.
8.0	They will learn more from the famous figures that how to persist and never give up during the compation.
8.0	It will also be useful for the younger to compete with other peers and will help them learn to grow.
7.0	Secondly,the influences that famous figures bring to the young can help them how to respect their
11.0	In contemporary society,the issue that whether it is better to relax by movies and books than physical exercise has given rise to much debate.
12.0	Some insist the idea that movies and books must be our first choice in our spare time.
11.0	I concede their opinion,however, from my perspective ,paticipating some physical exercise is a more sensible choice while considering the aspects of personal health and social communication.
5.0	The first reason is that it is a necessity to maintain our health condition all through our life.
8.0	It Iis widely acknowledged that most people are living a sedenary lifestyle while under massive pressure from working and studying requirement.
8.0	Therefore,physical exercise has become the most efficient way to help us relieve the stress and keep the organic function of our body.
8.0	What we need is certain amount of motion,though watching a movie or reading a book is relatively relaxing,we are still in a condition lacking of necessary exercise,which may give rise to obesity and even cardiovascular disease.
5.0	Another factor to support my idea is that we are able to expand our interpersonal circle by doing physical exercises with others.
8.0	Basketball ,soccer,tennis and some other ball games can exemplifiy this standpoint.
8.0	Under this circumstance,you will have easier access to communicate with people who share the same hobbies with you by the cooperation,coordination even competition on the court.
8.0	Standing on my side, I have gotten acquainted with a lot of interesting buddies while involvedin ball games ,which enlarges my social circle and enrichs my extracurricular acticities.
10.0	In a nutshell, the advantages of experiencing
3.0	Working together plays a vital role in finishing project.
3.0	When students work to finish the projects whether work together can help them learn mor effectively than work alone is controversial.
11.0	As for me, I believe that students working together can indeed be more effectively.
4.0	First, when students work together, they can supervise each other and encourage other students to finish the project.
8.0	As we konw, finishing project is always boring, when some students lost their interest, it's necessary for their mates to help concentrate on the project again.
8.0	A typicl illustration is my friend.
8.0	He used to do everything alone without others' help and supervise.
8.0	However, when he was exhausted, he found it hard to control himself, he always palyed games or did other things which can help him be relaxed, which waste most of his time.
8.0	And at the end, he even could not finish the project in time.
8.0	To solve the problem, his teacher asked some of us to do the project with him.
8.0	Finally, we indeed finished the project well.
8.0	According to this, undoubtfully it can help us finish the project.
4.0	Second, with the team work, we can learn more than we do projects on the own.
8.0	When we do things in group, it means we will also learn something except the teacher wants us to konw, such as how to deal with the problems together or how to get on with other teammates.
8.0	For example, I used to be very shy and I always felt uncomfortable when I stay with strangers.
8.0	But mt teacher always asked us students to some work together, which forced me to be outgoing and try to make friends with others.
8.0	To tell the truth, it really helpful.
8.0	Now I am used to cooprating with others, and I indeed thank what I learn from those group works.
8.0	This can well prove my idea.
4.0	On the other hand, though work alone may can develop students' inpendence, it can just give a little benefith to them.
8.0	Ther are many other better and more effective methods to do that, and perhaps this is due to their parents.
8.0	What teachers should    do is to lacture how to live when they come to the society.
8.0	There is no doubt cooprating is vital in everyday life.
2.0	All in all, in my opinion, asking students work together can indeed help them finish it and encourage them to learn more.
3.0	Nowadays some parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade(mark)they get in shcool.
12.0	For many parent think that the chilren are so hard to get a high grade,money may be a good gift for children.
12.0	And also parent have less time company their children when they work,so they also hope the money may be a good choice.
4.0	To be honest,I do not think this is a good idea.
8.0	Here are my reasons.
8.0	First of all,the children in school has few demand for money,their most task are study,get a high grade are their responsibility.
8.0	Parent can usem other method to cheer up them.
8.0	More money  lead their attraction to others,such as tools and computer games.
4.0	Then,parent should care children more then just give money for children' high grade.
9.0	Money for high grade may lead the children thinking that parent just care their mark instead of themslves.
9.0	This is much dangerous in the relationship between parent and children,of course much imact on the devlopment of children's mental.
4.0	Last but not least,parent should care more about children,such as healthy,mentally and so on.
9.0	I think a good student or child cannot be dulged just by thier grade,it means more.
9.0	Parent should cheer children to devlop thier interest not just grade.
2.0	To be honest,I do not think that some parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade(mark)they get in shcool is a good idea.
3.0	As the technology are developing rapidly, The people in the whole world is connected more firmly than any time in the past.
11.0	So as far as I am concerned, it is much more significant to relate well to people than to study hard in school.
4.0	Firstly, the ability to relate well to people will make it easy to cooperate with others.
8.0	Nowaday it is impossible for a single person to complete a complex task.
8.0	So we need the teamwork to finish the assignment and be successful in a future job.
8.0	I will use my experience as an example.
8.0	When I was serving as a worker in a company for a while during the summer vacation, I found everyone in the company was unfriendly and what they focused on everyday was just their work.
8.0	As a result, in the afternoon of my first day in that company, I volunteered to buy some delicious snacks for them.
8.0	I only spent little money but made everyone smile.
8.0	And the next day, we could chat with each other about only only works but also our daily lives.
8.0	In a word, we were getting to be friends rather than strangers working together and as a warm team, we can work much more efficiently than before.
4.0	Secondly, being able to relate well to people is good for our emotional health as well.
8.0	Human beings belong to social animals, and we are easier to be unhealthy emotionally if we are apart from the group.
8.0	For example, when I was studying in primary school.
8.0	one classmate of mine had serious emotional illness because he had never communicated with everyone.
8.0	Consequently, he could pass the middle school extrance exam since he was unable to get any knowledge during his primary school's classes.
8.0	If he could relate well to people, he wouldn't have such a bad enotional illness and he could grew up happily.
4.0	There is no doubt that studying hard in school is absolutely positive for us.
9.0	However, it is not as important as being able to relate well to people.
9.0	Only when we can relate well to others can we cooperate and have healthy emotion, which are valid for our success in a future job.
7.0	To sum up, the ability to relate well to p
11.0	I agree with that point,parents should give some money when their scool-age children get a high grade.
11.0	Beacause the education is more and more important now,and people use many way to encourage chilrdren to have more passionate in study.
11.0	And giving more is also a good choice.
5.0	Firstly,giving money is like a reward,this phenomenon will tell their children:if you work hard, you will get a prize.
8.0	That will change children's opinion to study,they will think the money is the purpose.
8.0	when they get feedback of their hard work,they will think of the study as a happy job instead of a boring and hard duty.
8.0	Getting money is like a goal for them too,they will more pasionate and happier to do this,they will kepp this interest and work harder.
8.0	So giving money to encourage them is necesseary.
5.0	Another reason is that possess some money will let them know some financial knowledge and inspire their ability to control the money.
8.0	Which means that the parents should not only give their children money,but also tell them how to manage it.
8.0	For instance,you have 30 dollars at this month,and you have 3 toys which you want to buy.
8.0	But your money isn't enough to afford them,so parents will tell them,you have to decide:which one is unnecessary,which one is necessary.
8.0	And how to spend the money is also an important problem for their chilrdren:buy something or save it?
8.0	It's all up to the children.
8.0	Chilren will benefit not only from their life now,they also need to know how to plan about their future life.
8.0	And if they choose to save the money at all the time,it will be a big amount for them.
1.0	According to that I mentioned about,giving money to scool-age children as a reward is a good choice.
1.0	It can encourage children and let them have the financial ability.
12.0	I think our parents is very good,they always help me on any thing,we must  said thanks for our parents.
8.0	but i think our parents always help us is not very good,becasue if always do that.
8.0	we not only can't get some help,but also will be bad.
8.0	so i think this is not very good for everyone,i think our parents should believe us,i think young people depended too much on their parents to make decisions for them,i think this is not very good and not very bad.
8.0	i think panent should believe him kid.
8.0	because i think hims kid is grow up .
8.0	they can do something alone, i think do this can help that young people.
8.0	in family they can said his or her opinion, i think do this is very good for them,if parents always help him's kids,that kid will be bad everyday,so i think parent should believe them kid do something,i think this is very good for us.
8.0	and if parent believe us ,i think we will feel very happy,we will said whit some people ,my parents believe me,this feel is very good for me.because i can do something alone,they will think this feel is very good for us,if young people do something alone,they can imporve our lives skills, if  we can live alone,this serion our really grow up,if our parents listed to this,i think they will feel very good,and some poeple will said for me we think you is very good ,we will study to you ,if young people do this,they can teach him friends how to live alone,how to live alone very good ,and if you live alone very well,you can teach so many people how to live alone very good,maybe you can be a teacher.
12.0	Recentely, many parents are trended to offer money to children to encourage children to get good grades.
11.0	As far as I'm cncerned, It's good for parents to offer school-age children money for high grade.
6.0	Firstly, giving money to children can increase children to study harder.
8.0	Studying can be really interesting, when students are given rewords for their hard works.
8.0	We can not doubt that studying sometimes is extremely boring to children.
8.0	Practicing, reading,and doing tests are surely can make children upset and anxiety.
8.0	So to get a goal as money to children is necessary for us.
8.0	We can use money to encourage children to have goals and study hard.
2.0	Secendly, in nowadays society, children should be trained to be sensitive to money.
11.0	I agree with this statement.
12.0	I thinknowadays, young people depeneded less on their parents to make decisions for them; but in the past young people depend too much on their parents to make desions.
4.0	Firstly, nowadays young people have more choices and opptunities about themselves, so they'd like to make these desions by themself.
8.0	As time goes by, the world becomes better and better, as a young child, i can  give an example about this.
8.0	A few days ago, my mom asked me that how can i spend my summer vacation.
8.0	I thought a few mins.
8.0	I answed her that i want to go a trip in my summer vacation.
8.0	In fact, i can choose many plans such as learning swmming  in a pool, reading books in a library or staying with my friends.
8.0	My mom laughed, she told me that in her childhood, she didn't have some long vacations, and in her free time she had no choice to do but do some heavy housework .
8.0	In the past, the society was not very developed, there was no travleing no library and so on.
8.0	They must depend on their parents how they can do, because they are all poor and few choice.
8.0	She said I was much happier than her.
8.0	I think so.
4.0	Secondly, nowadays, young people have many personalities, so we can make desions by ourselves.
8.0	We have our own thoughts and opinions.
8.0	So we should be more independent.
8.0	In tha past, young people just studyed hard to go to a good university and earn money, that time the countries were not as developed as now.
8.0	Now, we can have many hobbies ,it depends on ourselves.
8.0	As long as ilike one thing, i can do it.
8.0	You see, in the past, if i want to go abroad or learn Gutar, it may be imposible.
4.0	In addition, nowadays, young people become meature quickly.
8.0	We can know many things earlier because of the environment sometimes, so we would be more sensitive than the young in the past.
8.0	For example, i knew some skills about how to make friends when i was a child.
8.0	Because i can learn to through the internet ,books or other things to get it.
8.0	But in the past, they haven't these environments.
2.0	Therefore, i think nowadays the young is more independent to make desions than the young in the past.
3.0	Nowadays, the importance of colabaration is gradually more and more highlighted by the public for the growing sophisticated works in our highly developed society.
3.0	From the long-run moonlanding projects building rockets and spaceshuttles to the constuction of a school canteen, the essence of teamworking is irreplacible.
3.0	Hitherto vitrually all the education systems have focused mainly on the magnificance of teamworking, that explains why sometimes teacher assign projects on which students must work together.
3.0	As far as I am concerned, students not only learn more knowledge in a relative efficient way, but also equiped with the quality to deal with the sophisticated works in future career.
4.0	Firstly, the necessary pattern called brainstorming being existed in the teamwork, more ideas can be put on the scene when the group members sitting in a circle coming up with their different thoughts.
10.0	Not only can student gain the chance to gather different thoughts in an acoustic way, realizing where are their thought deadends, but they can have their critical thinking ability emerged by intensively comparing the various ideas, Numous benefits, including the ability to gather ideas and to think critically, are of great importance in increasing their efficient and accuracy in future study during the schooling.
4.0	Moreover, while collaborating with others, every student have to be awared that there will exist frequent agrees and disagrees in the groupworking ubiquitously, thus makes it vital for all the students to know how to stand for themselves as well as how to conpromise with others.
9.0	This ability, after being trained in schools, for example,can be widely applied into social affairs in the future when graduates in their careers face with dilemmas between the work and friendship.
9.0	Certainly students can learn something effectively far more than textbooks by teamworking.
4.0	In contrast, when a student is managing to figure out a problem in solo, chance is that he/she will likely run into deadends and without the help of others, it is difficult for one to find a proper solution out.
10.0	Plus, a student, being effected by the loneliness of workling alone, will convincingly reduce the work efficiency and the knowledge one can learn from working, and with passimistic emotions, a student may learm less effectively.
1.0	Anyway, it is glad to see that a great number of parents and teachers are paying more and more attention on the caracteristic of teamworking of the juveniles.
1.0	And with proper training during the schooling by finishing numerous teamworking projects, a graduate can be qualified enough with flourishing professional skills as well as socializing abilities, and can truly gain advantages in the fierce competitions.
12.0	Nowdays, there still many works in the world needs workers to do the same single things all day long.
12.0	But fortunateluy, more and more machines are used to do this sort of things instead of man.
5.0	When you do one thing all they long, it's easier to get tired and bored.
8.0	And then, our efficient will be slower and slower, and you might think there's still alot of things for you to finish and it seems that you are supposed to several hours more to finish it.
8.0	And maybe the boss won't feel happy and you may be fired tomorrow morning.
8.0	Of course you won't treat this as a happy experiement.
8.0	As we all know that workers has to be happy and then they may feel satisfied with their job.
5.0	Besides, we can easy find that repeat one thing again and again will soon make us lose interests.
8.0	In this wat, you can't draw all your attention on it, and you may eager to do something el;se.
8.0	For example, when I am doing my homrwork, I will change the subject about once in an hour.
8.0	Only on this way can I always pay all my attention to what I am learning of and keep my highest spirit to finish it.
8.0	Of course it's easier for you to work out those difficult questions when you are in high spirit and pan alll you attention on it.
8.0	And then you may be proud of yourself and satisfy with your work.
8.0	Also, it's the same situation about workers.
8.0	When workers can try different works, they will be happier to change their mind for a while to go over the new problems.
8.0	I think that's also why teenagers likec to play advevture games and someone likse to watch horrow movies.
8.0	So we can learn that workers will be more satisfied when they are always facing new things, even it may take new problems.
0.0	I wish that inthe future the same single works can all be done by robots or machines.
0.0	Doing different things can make workers finish things more efficient and more happier.
0.0	And I think it's better for both the employers and emploees.
3.0	With the fierce competition nowadays, more and more parents are willing to take various actions to push their kids towards.
3.0	Moreover, a large part of the parents recently like to use money to motivate children.
3.0	However, there are different voices towards this kind of events.
11.0	Some people disprove of it, because they think it is harmful to children's values.
10.0	But I think its benefits for for children are overweigh than disadvantages.
5.0	Firstly, money is a big motivation to children nowadays.
8.0	Modern children want more things to satisfy themselves than the children in old days.
8.0	They want to buy the latest toys that other children have, they want to purchase the candies which are very beautiful, they want to buy beautiful clothes and show they are differnent.
8.0	However, if parents permit to give these children some money which could totally satisfies themselves, only if they can get good grades, and they will try their best to achieve it.
8.0	To illustrates, my cousin was in a bad performance at school when she was 10 years old, also she was very naughty.
8.0	Nevertheless, one day, her parents had an idea that if she could get high mark in school, they could give her some money.
8.0	And at that time, she was really desire to buy a dress, but it was too expensive and her parents didn't allow her to buy it, and for that, she was depressed for a long time.
8.0	And the money her parents gave her can totally  afford this dress.
8.0	After that, she studied so hard than any other children in her age, she got up early to read books, and stayed up late in the evening to complete her homework and finally she got good grades.
5.0	In addition, children can learn how to spend money correctly, and appreciate the money she have.
8.0	When they get the money, they will buy something they like.
8.0	But many people have an endless desiration, so these children will learn to save money, and to optimize these money.
8.0	However, the children who don't get through thuis
0.0	Admitteddly, children may have some deviate values through this method.
0.0	Some children may think they study is for money, and not for their job or their future.
0.0	However, if the teacher or parents could teach them in a correct ways, everything will be fine.
3.0	Nowadays,many people are pleasure to relax themself after a whole day's work.
3.0	There is a arguement about which is the better way,watching a movie and reading a book or doing physical exercise.
11.0	In my opion,watching and reading is better for two important reasons.
5.0	First reason,watching a movie or reading a book is a easier and more suitable way to relax themselves campared with doing physical exercise.
8.0	You have to go to the gym or garden to physical exercise cause that most people dont have the conditions for this in their house.
8.0	People will spend much time and energe doing this which just can make them more tired.
8.0	On the orther hand,every people can reading a book or watching a movie easily and they dont have to choose the palce and time.
8.0	After all,people can reading or watching anywhere and anytime by the mobiephone nowadays.
5.0	Second reason,watching a movie or reading a book is more usefull.
8.0	There are many different way for everyone to relax themselves.
8.0	But most of them are useless and few people choose them.
8.0	So you can see that,more and more people watch a movie or read a book when they are free to relax themselves which can give them more knowlegde and benifit them much.
8.0	Also they can talk about the movie or book while they have fun with friends.
8.0	As for doing physical exercise,some people think its usefull for making a health body
3.0	Some people think that the government should pay attention to incease Internet access beacause peolpe could more believe Internet trades, and Internet access is more convenience.
11.0	However, I contend that government should enhance public transprotation due to the reason that number of people needs secure public transprtation, and guaranteed safety.
5.0	First, most of people think secure public transprotation is necessary work for government.
8.0	There are a lots of white-collar workers are needs going to work in the every mroning, so better public transprtation is more repid go to company.
8.0	Through boost public transprotation these people can more securely and effectivly arrive company.
8.0	For example, my sister catach the subway every morning.
8.0	Because this is most quikest way, if more transportation could choose will more convenience.
5.0	Second,people's most improtants things tht is their life.
9.0	This is beacause more graet public trsportation is ensure safety.
9.0	For instance, a lot of car accidents are destory many offamily.
3.0	When I was in primary school, one of my best friends lost her parents because of a car accident.
3.0	Since then, she missed her parents more often than before.
3.0	In contrast, I spent most of my time with my parents and felt less care about them than my friend does.
11.0	This contradictory leads me to think a question that whether people should understand the importance of relationships through being away from people they love.
11.0	Personally, I disagree this statement.
5.0	First of all, being far away from your friends or relatives has negtive impact on the interactions betwwen two person.
8.0	You have to admit that everyone in this world cherish the moments that they spend with their closest person.
8.0	If you're far away from your friends, you will not be able meet them and have conversations with them as usual.
8.0	You lose the chance to talk about your innermost feeling and thoughts that cannot be impressed through telephones or social media.
8.0	And as we all kown, relationships need connection betwwen two person to maintain.
8.0	Since you have less interactions in this relationship, you would think it's unnecessary and forget it soon or later.
8.0	As a result, being too far away leads to the end of the relationships.
5.0	Moreover, being far away from your friends or relatives produces unreasonable conflicts to the relationships.
8.0	Take my friend and her boyfriend as an example.
8.0	They used to sustain a good relationship, however, my friend was sent to a out-of-the-way town to teach children there.
8.0	From then on, my friend always thought her boyfriend would cheat on her because she was not be able to company him.
8.0	Therefore, she kept asking her boyfriend where he went, who he met today, and so on.
8.0	At the end, her boyfriend was tired of her questions and broke up with her.
8.0	Distance would lead you to think the person you love are doing things that you don't like and want to know every details about days they has been through.
8.0	In the long term, that person will feel exhausted and want to end the relationship.
2.0	All in all, I think being far away from those person we love is actually a damage to maintain the relationships since distance can produce more conflicts and less interactions.
3.0	Obviously, nowadays, there is a large proportion of young people who are crazy about some celerbrities in many fields, including music, entertainers, athletes and so on.
3.0	In the information age, with some advances advertisement strategies, the young has been the  advertisement goal group becasue the young is more acceptable and prefers to spend money on it than the old people.
11.0	Therefore, I propose that celebrities are more vital to younger people than the older people.
6.0	To begin with, the people always keep the pace of trend when they are young.
8.0	Because when we are young, we are dynamic and love socialnizing.
8.0	To be more specific, movies, like science movie, romantic movies and comedy, are the major entertainment of most young people.
8.0	In weekends, young people often go to theaters with they're friends.
8.0	And during the dinner time, with an enthusiathen discussion, it renders their friendership more imitive.
8.0	Had did we not see these movies, we might have lose a lot of opportunities to chat with friends, while the old mans will not care about whether they have been out of date.
1.0	On top of that, the main group of advertisements is the young people because they more favor to buy something which are represented by their idols.
1.0	Based on this fact, some advertisement companies will invite those popular celebrites who appeals the young rather than the old.
10.0	In this case, for some sport companies, such as NIKE and Addidas,  when they coopreate with the famous stars, Anglababy and Eason, who are really popular in young people, a large numerous young people will buy thier products.
7.0	On the contray, if they invit
11.0	I don't think that's a good idea.
11.0	When their school-age children are in a middle school,the parents can give them money to make a living.
12.0	As the children grow up,the parents shouldn't give them money.
6.0	Firstly,the children will think it is grant to get the money.
8.0	They will depand on their parents all the way.
8.0	They can't do anything by their own.
8.0	Especially for a boyif he can't manage the things,how can he hold his family in the future?
8.0	Secondly,the children will unknow the difficlty of getting the money.
8.0	Thet will waste the money in many wrong ways.
8.0	They will go to the webbar,the KTV,the high-price place and so on.
8.0	What a wrong  way!
8.0	What's more,children in high grade have ability to earn money to live his own.
8.0	As for me,my parents gave me money in the first when I went to university.
8.0	Then,half for the second year.
8.0	None for the later.
8.0	Now,I can make money by myself.
8.0	I can buy gifts for my friends on my own.
8.0	I needn't ask for money from ma parents.
8.0	I feel I'm a free and good boy.
8.0	Everyone has his own effect.
8.0	We can't go futher by using our parents' legs.
1.0	So,I don't think that's a good idea.
1.0	Parents shouldn't spoil their children.
7.0	They should believe the children can manage well
3.0	Rencently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate: whether young people today are more likely to invest their time and efforts in improving the world than young people in the past.
3.0	Opinion varies from person to another.
11.0	Some claim that young people are not willing to put more time and efforts in improving the world that young people in the past.
11.0	However,  contrary to their view comes my perspective that the young people distribute more time and efforts in changing the world than before.
12.0	My points are elaborated as follow.
5.0	Firstly, with the development of society, the young people could obtain more feedback if they choose to improve the world.
8.0	Today, the company and government are willing to provide more position to the young people and increase the sallery rapidly than before, which encourage the passion of young people to work harder in different areas, such as inventing efficient electronic equipment, building beautiful bridge, improving the method of teaching, so that the world is improved quickly.
8.0	By contrast, in the past, the sallery is relatively low, leading to the difficulty of meeting basic needs, so it is impossible for the young people to invest their time and efforts to improve the world.
8.0	Imaging the situation, if a man could gain a well-paid job as a engineer, which could guarantee him a high quailty of daily life, besides the earning money for making a living, he could distribute much time to improve the appreance of bridge.
5.0	In addition, the developed education arouses the awareness of making the contribution to the society.
8.0	Becasue the students obtain much more knowledge, so that it is likely for them to realize that they take a lot of benefits from the society, such as the chance of studying in the senior high school for free.
8.0	so they should take the responsibility of improving the world.
8.0	By contrast, in the past, without these knowledge, they would pay more attention to themselves and don't understand the importance to make contribution to the society, so they would not invest their time and efforts to improving the society.
8.0	For example, a fifteen years old people who has no chance to study in the senior high school work with his workmates.
8.0	Under this situation, the every day conversation is about the sallery, the price of the meat or the beautiful car and clothes.
8.0	So he could not realize the importance of the contribution to the society, and he also can't eveluate the import of society on him, and he is not willing to make feedback t
2.0	In conclusion, it is necessary to repeat my view that the young people is likely to invest their time and efforts to the society than before, because the society could give more feedback, and the contain the awareness of making the contribution to the society.
12.0	With the development of the society and the economy, a lot of jobs no more fashion like before but teacher will be appreciated and valued by the socity whether in the past or in nowadays.
12.0	This is because, teacher gives students useful knowledges and in the future they will use this to contribute to the society.
11.0	And they also build the right insight for these young people that will reduce the crime in the future.
5.0	Firstly, teachers play an important role in development of the human society.
8.0	When a person just 4 to 5 years old, they will be send to the school.
8.0	And the first world they learn; the first theory the know was given by the teacher.
8.0	In the future, they use these knowledge that gain from the teacher to creat some new things which can change the the pace of the development of the human.
8.0	Indeed, some people want to use website to exchange the teachers but this way was fail.
8.0	These students who just learn the knowledge on the website and without teachers all cannot use the knowledge that they learn to creat.
8.0	Not only that they all have poor ability to cooperate and talk with others.
8.0	This is because, they cannot interact with teachers and there are no one practice these new knowledge with them.
8.0	This is why websites and television that occur in nowadays can never work like teacher.
8.0	So nowadays  the teachers are as important as they were in the past.
5.0	Secondly, the teachers not only teache the students the useful knowledge to help the society but they also teach them how to be a good man, which means have good moral.
1.0	In the past the black man community was very miss; everyday there will die people.
1.0	The goverment brought a lot of policeman here but the situation never changed.
10.0	In the
3.0	It is known to all that we are living in a demanding society.
12.0	So from children to old people, they all should work hard to live in this society.
12.0	Nowadays, people always pay numerous attention to the education of children in order to help them have a bright future.
11.0	In this way, I agree that parents today are more involved in the education of their children than were parents in the past.
4.0	To begin with, parents nowadays are required to pay attention to their children's study.
8.0	With the development of technology, the forms that children do their homework are changed.
8.0	Teachers may send the homework of the student to the wechat groups, which the children's parents are in.
8.0	And then, parents are asked to monitor how their children do their homework and give feedback to the teachers.
8.0	Moreover, sometimes parents are asked to attend parents' meeting more often than in the past.
8.0	In this way, parents now are always required to be involved in their children's education.
4.0	Then, parents now often help their children decide what to do in children's spare time.
8.0	Since the society is very competitive, all the parents want their children to be better than other children.
8.0	So they always decide which class their children are to take, and when their children should study at home and when they should go to class.
8.0	Take my sister as an example.
8.0	My sister is only 6 year old, who is just in the first grade.
8.0	Her parents don't want her to fall behind others, so they decided that she should go to the dance class on Saturday afternoon in order to make her look more confident and slim.
8.0	And they also suggest that she should go to a math class on Sunday morning.
8.0	So parents nowadays often help make decisions in their children's education fields.
4.0	Last but not the least, although parents in the past were also caring about their childrens education, they are less involved in the education process.
8.0	Parents in the past paid more attetion to the living condition of the family, so most of their time were devoted to their work.
8.0	They usually just told their children to act good in school, and they do nothing to help them study.
8.0	This is also because that few people in the past knew that education is fundamental to children's future and the society background is very different that it didn't need people to pay a lot of attention to education.
2.0	To conclude, though parents in the past and now all pay attention to their children's education, it can't be denied that parents nowadays are more involved in the education process of their children than are parents in the past.
11.0	As far as I'm aware,I think it's a good idea that school-age children should be offered money for their high grade getting in school.
8.0	Firstly,money can servre as a catalyst for those who don't have much interset or confidence in study.
8.0	To illustrate,when I was in primary school,there was a time when I have some trouble in math and I was nearly cast out.
8.0	Noticing my disappointment,my mother made a deal with me that I could be taken to the amusement pa for fun if I stuck on learning and got a good result.
8.0	This point worked and my grade began to improve.
8.0	Most of kids' needs are connected with money and once they are promised with money they will try their best to attain them,hence their grades improved.
6.0	What's more,children may get a significant topic from this idea  that persistence and intelligence is what it takes to fulfill their goals.
10.0	Every time they are provided with money in the exchange for their marks,they will be joyful and start fighting for a larger progress without a hesitation.
2.0	Last but not least, mothers will be comforted in this process that their money is used in a correct way.
10.0	In the past,their sons or daughters may ask them for money for no reason but now everything happens for a reason.
11.0	I do not agree with this statement.
11.0	I think it depends on  workers' personalities and ability.
12.0	A wide range of  tasks might make some people feel more interesting and freshing.
11.0	But for other people, they will find them too hard and complex to finish.
8.0	All kind of work need to be finished in one day , which can make workers crazy.
8.0	They need to pay attention to different things and think different ideas to cope with these tasks.
8.0	So i think this relies on people's personality.
8.0	Some individuals like to deal with many different types of work.
8.0	They think doing like this has more challenge for them.
8.0	While others hold the view that this will make work more complicated.
8.0	If this situation happens, their feelings will be influenced.
8.0	What is more, their efficiency will reduce.
6.0	The second reason is workers' ability.
8.0	Among workers, there are some people who have good capacity or not.
8.0	I think a company is like a class where there are students with different academic performance.
8.0	In one class, the teacher arranges four assignments.
8.0	The top students can finish them quickly with high rate of correction.
8.0	By contrast, students who do not absorb knowledge only can complete two or three homework in one class.
8.0	If you require them to do four, maybe they will do them without careful heart.
8.0	So there will be many falses in their homework.
8.0	Finally, the poor grades will have a negative effect on their confidence on study.
8.0	So do that in the company, the quality of tasks finished can be impacted.
8.0	When a boss has some work, he needs to take many aspects  into consideration.
8.0	One standard does not suit for everyone.
0.0	In conclusion, when workers meet various tasks, they may not feel more satisfied.
0.0	Also, they may think similar tasks are not boring.
0.0	People with different personalities and ability respond this situation differently.
12.0	I agree with the opionion that children these days do homework or participating activities related to school or sports,however, they should be given time to do what ever they wanted.
5.0	First, spend too much time on homework is unhealthy.
8.0	You did't have any time to relax yourself (except for preparing for exam).
8.0	Long period of time later ,you will felt your head is dizzy, your buttucks hurt.
8.0	You have sour back.
8.0	The key is you felt really sleepy.
8.0	You still try to struggle to finish the study mission.
8.0	This can be have bad consequences.
8.0	Organ illness is the consequence that the children overstudy.
8.0	According to the data that from the China Healthy Control Government, every year,there are several children get ill or died from some illness,the main reason that get the organ illness is did't get enough rest from work on study and their leader of the victim alway give them too much work on them lke teachers give student too much homework, boss give their employee too much work.
5.0	Second, spend too much time on home work could be bad for children's psychology.
8.0	Children really need to develop some abilitys tha tnot related to school or sports, likre go to the comic show and participate in costume play.
8.0	These can really fuulfill children's eyesight.
8.0	Refresh childrens heart and mind.
8.0	If they spend too much time on homework, their psycological consequence is negative worse.
8.0	Children can have some bad mind, such as don't want to study, play truant, have an affair on the socialty.
8.0	In the end, the legal punishment will happend on him.
1.0	In the end , I strongly suggest that parent should communicate more to their children instead of having an arguement with them.
1.0	You have to truly understand what c=the children actually thinking, only that it is the best way to solve.
11.0	I think it is a good idea that some parents offer their school-age childern moey for each high grade they get in school.
12.0	Firstly,this will encouge the childern to study harder and fouce more on study ,which could bring students with better grades.
11.0	Later the childern will have more confidence on study.
12.0	Secondly,it will give the children a sense of achivement when they get good grades and get money.
11.0	This can let them kown that there is no elavator to success,you have to take the stairs .
11.0	If there are someting you want,you need to try to get it by yourself not others.
6.0	Third,parents offer money for childern when they get good grade is an essencial way to strenghen the parent-child relathionship.
10.0	In this way,it offers a proper oppertunerty for family members to communicate more frequently.
2.0	What's more,the school-age childern get their own money would made them to learn how to use the money in a right way,which would be significant when they enter the social world.
3.0	As far as I am concerned,it's a good idea that children will get reward when they get high mark in school.
3.0	On the one hand,it wil atract children to study harder to get the gifts from parents,on the other hand,the reward they have got wil encourage them to study more harder for the next test in school.
11.0	It will make a positive circle that make children's passion grow and get a good grade.
4.0	"As for me,when I'm in the high school,every month we will participate in the ""per-month test"",depite of the pressure from school,parents's care to me is also a big burden."
8.0	So how can I solve this question?
8.0	Eventually I found that I like animate,those figures of characters from animation will make me feel relaxed.
8.0	"Then I make a deal with my parents,""As if I get good marks in the per-month test,I will get a animate figure which I want."""
4.0	In fact,this deal works.
8.0	Becuase I have not enough money to purchase animate figure as a high school student,so the only way to get the things I want is to make a good mark in the exam.
8.0	And how I can get good grade?
8.0	Apparently,studying harder and harder.
8.0	A quite simple way,doesn't it?
4.0	Exactly,sometimes I can't reach the mark-line what I needed,so there is no reward for me,but it doesn't matter.
8.0	"As an old saying goes,""failure is the mother of success."""
8.0	I miss the reward this time,next time I will try me best to win back!
8.0	This kind of idea always encourages me to hold on at the way of study.
0.0	Finally,when I end my high-school life,What I have harvest are the letter of admission of a good university,and lots of animate figure I like.
0.0	What a great business for me!
0.0	So I agree that parents should offer school-age children money when they get high grade in school.
12.0	The educational problem can always draw a lot of attention.
11.0	All parents hope to enducate in an appropriate way which is better for their kids to grow up.
12.0	In the process of kids growing up, praising and puishment is two topic we can not avoided.
11.0	What is the best way to reward and what is proper to punish obsess all.
12.0	Nowadays, some parents offer their children money for high grade they get in school.
11.0	As far as I am concerned, this is not appropriate for school age children.
8.0	Admittedly, reward is a good way to encourage children to do better in the next time.
8.0	I can not agree with rewarding children better.
8.0	But money is the worst thing as a reward.
8.0	Here are the reasons.
5.0	First of all, the school-age children do not have the ability to deal with money.
8.0	When they get money, they will tend to use money for toys, computer games, even cigerates or other things which may be harmful for their growing.
8.0	It is hard for them to distinct which is beneficial and which bad.
8.0	They just justify by their own preference.
8.0	When the right to decide how to spend money rely on themselves, it will be hard to control in the future.
8.0	Asking their parents for what they want may be a better way.
8.0	So that their parents can help them to justify whether they want is proper.
5.0	In addition, it is not a good way to build their attitude toward money.
8.0	When parents always take money as an reward, children will think that only money is valuable.
8.0	They can use money to get whatever they want.
8.0	But this kind of thought is not appropriate for kids.
8.0	Reward should be a kind of thing which can encorage children to study they want.
8.0	Reward shoud be guide which let children to pursue their interest such as their favorite books or the painting utensil rather than money which can fufill their lure.
8.0	Other kind of reward will be more helpful.
1.0	To sum, there is no doubt that reward is a good way to encourage is a common sense.
1.0	But what the reward is is the most important part we should concentrate.
7.0	money
12.0	Some people may think that if workers do similar tasks all day long, they will be more satisfied for a reason that their work life will become more and more smooth to handle becasue of their increasing skills in this kind of work.
12.0	However, I hold a utterly different kind of view.
11.0	The workers will be more satisfied when they have many different types of tasks to do.
4.0	First and formost, people will undoubtedly develop a sense of achievement when they learn something new.
8.0	And that is the case.
8.0	Workers who have different types of tasks are surely more likely to handle new skills and knowledge than those who do similar tasks all day long.
8.0	Meantime, that kind of achievement will uplift their spirit and push them being more energic towards their works.
4.0	Second, they will get safety from doing so.
8.0	As is known to us all, the less skills the work demands, the more suitable people are.
8.0	And competition, which is the main pressure many labors who lack various skills faced up with, comes to rise.
8.0	If more skills are handled, the worker will become more valuable to the company.
8.0	And as a result, he or she is less likely to be replaced by individuals who are more competitive.
8.0	This kind of safety can undoubtedly strengthen their satisfactory.
4.0	Last but not the least, workers can attain pleasure by socializing with others if they have different types of work assigned.
8.0	In many companies, the working zones are divided by the kind of work that will be done in this area.
8.0	It is obvious that you are capable to meet and socialize with more people if you can go to more zones through doing different kinds of tasks.
8.0	Once you own many friends rather than strangers in you company, a harmonous atmosphere will come into being around you which leads to happiness and satisfactory.
1.0	All in all, when workers have different types of tasks to do during the workday, they are more satisfied.
1.0	They will attain pleasure from learning new skills，achieve a sense of safety for less likely to be replaced and be merged into a harmonous atmonsphere because of enough socialization.
3.0	With the development of the society, more and more people put a premium on their leisure time, during which they can chhose to raise a pet.
3.0	Now a heated discussion arises about whether it si beneficial for children to keep a pet.
3.0	Some people hold the opinion that children can benefit little from keeping a pet while others hold the opposite viewpoint.
12.0	As far as I am concerned, I endorses the latter for a couple of reasons.
5.0	To begin with, keeping a pet help children maintain both physically and mentally healthy.
8.0	Imagine this senery: when children finish their tasks at school and go back home, they may be tired.
8.0	However, if a pet such as a dog greet with them or even kiss them, they may feel relaxed at this moment,so pets can release their pressure temporarily.
8.0	Besides, chidren will set aside some time with their pets, like running after pets, hang out with pets, play ball with them and some other sports, in which both the pets and chidren can exersise.
8.0	In a result, chidren's body state can be improved.
5.0	On top of that, chidren can gradually establish a rational view on responsibity when taking care of pets.
8.0	To iilustrate, when a child wants to keep a dog, he need to feed the dog, play with dog and train the dog.
8.0	What is more, if the dog get sick, he may have to find this situation ang take the dod to hospital in time.
8.0	In this process, he acts as the dog's parent, and can feel it is his resibonsibilty to take care of the dog.
8.0	In addtion, he can gradually understand love of his parents, and aprriciate his parents, which can help him become more understanding.
0.0	All in all, it is true that keeping pets mat take up children's somen time and have a risk being infected.
0.0	However, pets not only are able to help children keep healthy ,but also make them be responsible.
0.0	Considering these benefits, I strongly agree that keepin pets is beneficial to kids.
3.0	Sophisticated technology ,explosive information and intricate relationship all work together to create this colorful and modern world ,under this surrounding,people have to be more skillful and creative to get a decent job ,so that is obviously a great pressure for youngster to find a good job.
3.0	So it is worthwhile for society to think about whether it is good to find a similar job to  teenagers' parents .
11.0	In my opinion ,I agree with the statement that to find a job that are similar to parents' jobs for the young.
5.0	To begin with, there is no doubt that it is easier to take a relative job with the guides of your parents than a job which are totally different from your parents' ,the younger can easily get to the right ways and avoid many unnecessary troubles.
8.0	Take my experience as an example ,I still remembered when I chose the major in the university after entrance exam.
8.0	Frankly speaking I have no idea of what kinds of major I will take and be interested in,I have put all my efforts on preparing the entrance exam .
8.0	So that is a really trouble for me .
8.0	However , my mother gave me an option to major in journalism.
8.0	Cuz  my mom is an journalist ,she wants me become a jourlist just like her.
8.0	Hence without hesitation I  chose the journalism as my major.
8.0	Luckily when I graduated I got the offer from a famous agency- Xinhua agency the biggest agency company in China ,so it it obvious that choosing the similar job to our parents can help us get rid of some troubles.
5.0	What's more ,choosing the similar jobs to parents can help us accumulate experience easily ,which also benefit you switch to another job.
8.0	One  of my friends major in education due to his father's job -a college teacher .
8.0	After graduation ,he became a high school teacher successfully .
8.0	he says his father gave him a lot of exprience,like how to communicate with workmates around him .
8.0	so he can succeed speedly.
1.0	Granted ,many people will say it is not coloful to choose the same job as parents do,however that not mean you will do one job all the time .
1.0	after get experience you can switch to other job .
7.0	so that not a probel
11.0	As more and more entrepreneurs are reported to manage to establish their companies, more scholars become well-known for their brilliant discoveries, and more celebrities gain fame and be loved by the multitude, some ordinary people are inspired to achieve success.
12.0	Admittedly, success is important, but it is more significant to keep happy and optimistic in the face of failure.
5.0	To start with, without an optimistic mind one can hardly succeed.
8.0	To be specific, the process towards success is filled with obstacles and difficulties.
8.0	Those successful businessmen and the celebrities are the very small part of the hard workers, while the rest of them have to face the failure and disappointment.
8.0	In this case, under no circumstances can they achieve success and harvest power and wealth without the spirit of persistence and optimism.
8.0	In other words, they need to keep trying with the aid of optimism unless they succeed eventually.
8.0	For example, Abra ham Lincoln, one of the most famous US presidents, is an excellent point.
8.0	Before he achieved success in the election, he had suffered from numerous disasters such as several bankrupts, divorce, and even mental diseases.
8.0	However, tough as he was, he managed to tide the difficulties over, trying over and over again and performing better after each failure.
8.0	Eventually, he was elected as the president and led the north to win the civil war nad abolish the slavery.
5.0	Besides, success is not everything but only one way to attain happiness, but optimism offers the key to happiness.
8.0	To illustrate, as the ancient Greek scholar said, happiness is the ultimate end of one's life.
8.0	In other words, people are not born to seek for success but love and happiness.
8.0	In this society, people are prone to be anxious because of the overwhelming reports about success of the wealthy and famous.
8.0	In this way, people are triggered to be disappointed of their relatively tedious lifestyle and urge to experimence the perfect life that the successful persons enjoy.
8.0	Nevertheless, success may not the real target for some people.
8.0	Some persons feel lonely and less happy after they become famous and prestigious, and therefore miss the ordinary and peaceful life when they were ananimous.
8.0	As a result, the mindset of keeping optimistic and happy of the present life is much more important for everyone.
2.0	To sum up, although success may provide people with happy and the sense of fulfillment, the mindset of remaining happy and optimistic is much more essential for people to look for the door to happiness.
3.0	Job definetely is an important and essential gredient of one peolpe's life.
3.0	How to choose a job obviously is a crucial events for every young people and their parents.
11.0	Some people think that there is nothing better to build the cornerstone toward future than choose a job which is similar to what parents do.
12.0	Nevertheless, I am into the tune that we are supposed to choose jobs that are very different with our parents.
4.0	In the first place, we are supposed to choose a totally different jobs with our parents in order to expand our outlook.
8.0	My own experience can successifully illustrate this opinion.
8.0	I was mastery of myriad lows and how to use low address some bussiness contrast because My mother who is a lowyer always force-feed me lots of knowledge about low.
8.0	Therefore, I am proficient into fied of low.
8.0	However, I will not choose to be a lowyer in my later life because I think it is so boring to touch the low in my whole life.
8.0	I want to be a reporter owing to the fact that I can travel all over the world, see different landscapes and exchange opinions with people who have different culture and tradition with us.
8.0	That To escape from the area of low and to expore more new thing is the reason why I prefer choosing a job witch is totally different with my parents.
4.0	In the second place, in order to challenge ourselve without our parents' help, I prefer choosing a job which totally different with my parents' job.
8.0	It is a well-known fact that our parents accumulate lots of resource and build up a exellent stages in their work field.
8.0	Therefore, If we obtain a job which is likely to our parents, they can give us help and resources.
8.0	This way, we will achieve the goal on work without any risks.
8.0	This experience is too boring and we can not get experience of failure.
8.0	To set up my own bussiness with is totally different with our parents can make us use our knowledge, social connection and intelligent to copy with a myriad of accident difficulties, which can challenge ourselves and enrich our life.
4.0	In the third plcae, when our interet field is to remote from our parents work field, we are supposed to persist on our own way.
8.0	My brother,Daniel, can use his life experience to illustrate this opinion.
8.0	Daniel are a big fan of basketball and he wanted to be a basketball player in the future when he was a young boy even my parents' job were totally unrelevant with basketball.
8.0	Neverthless, Daniel still choose his own way.
8.0	Like he said, he never hesitate to do this choice and he is happy in his work every day because he is the labor of love about basketball.
8.0	Therefore, when our interest field are totally different with our parents job, we should to persist on our dicision because interest can equip us the ability to overcome every challenges.
2.0	To sum up, I definitely keep in tune that we should to choose the jobs that are very different from our parents' job.
3.0	Do you think it is important for a student to have some sports acticities in their spare time?
3.0	So will you balance your sports and study time?
12.0	From my perspective, I really agree with the statement that sports and study should be regared as equal and then get the same financial support.
5.0	Only if we have healthy and energetic body, we can have the capital to study.
8.0	A strong body is the basis to study, let alone study in a high efficiency.
8.0	Yaoming, a famous Chinese basketball player, is a typical instance to support my point of view.
8.0	When he was a high school student like most of the students, he finished a bunch of assignments given by teacher, had highly intensed classes everyday and so on.
8.0	But he always slept on class and is really lacked energy during the study process.
8.0	After getting familiar with the importance of sports, he tried to have exercise everyday.
8.0	He became really enjoy the sweating from running, the breathing after jumping and so on.
8.0	What's more, he never slept on the class anymore and he felt extremely rejuvenated after some appropriate sports acticities, so the study effiency is greatly increased a lot.
8.0	We can obviously know that having sports acticities can help us have a health body, which is necessry during study, and then we can both have some rest in the exercise time and study in a more high efficiency.
8.0	Thus, the importance between should be regared the same and definitely get the same financial support from universities to build more sports facilities and chances for students.
5.0	Although social activities seem like a kind of entertainment, it can really teach us a lot which can not learn from the books in library and the teaching from classes.
8.0	Taks myself, a social activities lover in high school, as an example to illustrate my own statement.
8.0	I love participating social activities, including present exchange party, birthday party, dance meeting, speech matches, club activities and so on.
8.0	All I dois try my best to join in those social activities in my spare time as much as I can.
8.0	The difference between my and those people who only seat in the class is that I was more outgoing and can communicate with others fluently without out any nervousness.
8.0	Also, my friends are always much more than them, so I never feel lonely and boring in my study time.
8.0	Thus, the universities should spend their money also on holding some social activities for those people who are really shy and only love studying but can not do nothing when they leave the class.
8.0	Social ability is necessary in everyone's life and can be only learned from the true condition but not the books and teacher's theories.
2.0	In summary, universities should give financial support the same as the classes and sports activities.
10.0	No one is less important than the other one,
3.0	During the growth of the children, some situations will always bother the parents, and a part of the parents are trying their best to guide children to distinguish the mistakes and allow them to learn from the experiences.
12.0	I totally agree with   the idea of those parents, and i believe most of the pupils would draw a lesson from the unexpected.
4.0	Firstly, it can cultivate their responsibilities.
8.0	According to the database from bureau of education, almost 80 percent of kids will not be able to manage their own stuff, and 5 percent of children even can not ensure their own safety; only 15 percent students master how to live independently.
8.0	And after the interview of those ''special'' kid's parents, people learn that their children learn more more than the pupil in their parents's warm shield, they can make a lesson after having a real moral, not only emulating the ''book learning'' from their parents talk.
8.0	And those kids wiil have a faster mobility and the ability of deformation after all.
4.0	Secondly, the over-protected children will not be able to be independent, even worse.
8.0	For instance, a famous ''mommy boy'' in the news, he even can not take care of himself, and his mother is always surronded by him even he went to the college.
8.0	That is the result of over-protected.
8.0	While the layer of coddle covering the children, we believe we can harvest a perfect kid, but eventually, he will become a disabled person just like a real one who has no ability to handle any situations even a piece of cake.
4.0	At last , the mistakes can help with the development of confidence.
10.0	If a person who never been through the tough, once he met some diffculties, he may do cowardly things and choose to escape from the reality; this is the behavior of lack of confidence., while one people who is full of experiences after having lots of mistakes and problems, he will figure out how to make things right and do whatever he can do to give a solution.
1.0	All in all, a lyric show the story of this idea ''there is a love called letting go, beacuse their hands we learn ourselves''.
1.0	Indeed, this is the best way of learing in a real life.
3.0	With the proliferation of Internet, many civilian hope government could spend more money on it for its order.
12.0	However, I am frown on the comment that it is more important for govenments to spend more money to improve Internet access than to improve public transportation because I have several reasons.
5.0	Firstly, investing more money on public transportation are benefit to ecosystem.
8.0	Variety of industries of public transportation are purchase some low quality equipment to produce those transportation, which gives off too many waste gases and cause unecessary waste.
8.0	Therefore, the environment is polluted severly and the original ecosystem is damaged.
8.0	Like the river, instead of oxygen, now is full of sulfer dioxide.
8.0	Therefore, increasing fishes are die out and the predator of these fishes are endangered.
8.0	However, increasing the investment can reform those equipment, so that the efficiency can be boosted a lot and there are less wasted material could be remained.
5.0	In addtion, increasing the investment in such area could convenient people's life.
8.0	Nowadays most people search Internet just for entertainment.
8.0	However, every person needs to adapt in their live, and they could not live withoutbpublic transportation, because they need to go to school, go to work or go to the hospital.
8.0	Therefore, public transportation play a pivotal role in their life.
0.0	Admittedly, investing money to improve Internet access is important, becuase many people spread some fake imformation on Internet, which would disturb the tranquil life of civilian.
0.0	However, spending money to improve public transportation is significent too, since numbers of lives of human-being are losing because of government ignore the the safety of some transportation.
0.0	The internel engine, for example, are not qualified but equip on many buses which cause a number of exploration events.
3.0	As children's education arouses more and more attention,the methods how parents encourages their children to study becamoe debateable.
12.0	Although many people rebut the idea that children should receive money from their parents for their good grade,I still thinkg that it is a good way to strenthen kids' interest in study for several reasons.
5.0	To begin with,getting extra money for ideal study result does help children keep going in their learning.
8.0	In a company,if a employee get bonus for his excellent performence,there is no doubt that he will be motivated to try to do better in the next period in order to get the bonus again.
8.0	In the field of education,it is true as well.
8.0	To illustrate this point, I would like to raise my own experience as an example.
8.0	When I was in my primary school,I always ask for my parents to buy toys for me.
8.0	However,they usually didn't permit to do it unless I made progress in the coming exam.
8.0	In order to get the toy I was dreaming of,I had to put more time and effort into preparing.
8.0	Undoubtly,my study was benefit from this method even though it was the toys I was working hard for.
5.0	Moreover,this kind of result-oriented method can give the kids a lesson about the society.
8.0	Obviously,no matter which field we are in,it is the result rather than how hard you do that decides our reward,although it is kind of cruel for a child.
8.0	Usually,kids will receive phrasing from the teachers from their hard work.
8.0	It is always right to do that because children need encouragement.
8.0	But in my point of view,if children can get extra reward not only for the process but also the result,they will be propeled to improve the way of their study which is good for their developement.
10.0	to draw a conclusion,parents should give their kids extra
11.0	Some people agree as it is a general truth that a good idea,but i think that is not great idea, because i think some school may have a normal school grade.
12.0	i have some thinking in this: you have a normal price they can believe you,and other is the price are so  expensive.
10.0	Some people think have a high grade is great , that i think is great too, because if some school have high grade, than they have some good experience, for example some good school like wuhan second school, that is very great school, and that grade is hight too, but some parents like this school to ,because this school is very good, so the grade is hight, than the people go to this school, however i have this ways but i have another way to support the instead ways.
5.0	Firstly, i think the high grade they get it school is not great, because some parents think the grade is hight they can't believe these school , for instance some poor familary their children have a high grace but they money have not good so many parent looks some good school money they are afraid, and than they can't believe that this is school price, so ,i think this is a good example to in this way, so i diaagree this statement.
5.0	Second, i have another ways to evidence to this ways is not good, like some not farmes school have expensive grade , thrir familary are very afraid , to illstrate some parents are not know the school ,but some school havae a high grade to introduce some students go in there school, so many people and parents can't take enough money.
10.0	so many people think this school grade is so expensive.
10.0	Ina word, pay some each hih grade they get in school taking into account of all these factors, we may reach the conclusion that you have a normal price and other is the price are so expensive.
3.0	With experience in workplace a heated topic among young professionals, people nowadays put more corncern on the types of work they are involved in and the content of them rather than anything else.
3.0	Whether a job with different tasks or a job with similar tasks is more appealing had divide onlookers into two parties.
12.0	According to my experience, I am in favor of the former for they create much more fun in the company with  explanations and exapmles given as below.
5.0	Firstly, different types of tasks bring more challenges to a ordinary employee, which promises more a potential change of their current situation.
9.0	In order to solve problems that came along with this newly assigned job, people can be more motivated to find answers using all kinds of resources, and be more creative in thinking out of the box.
9.0	This not only encouraged their self development but also bring out the best from them rather than ordinsry life setting, given them a new pespective to the whole issue and a promised promotion if they can handle these tasks sucessfully.
5.0	Secondly, different tasks at work give people a break from the scheduled meetings and  piled documents, which allow them to change their settings in mind and  brings back the connection with the realms of knowledge that they have learned before.
9.0	Through this change, people can leave their tight work pattern and  their fully piled table for a while and try the new style in a safe  way.
9.0	For example, Benjamine Franklin is a scientist and politician.
2.0	In a nut shell, people tend to enjoy the work better if they ate allowed to have many different types of the work during the work day.
3.0	Nowadays, with the countinuous development of society.
11.0	More and more peoplle get rich, so they have a variety of lifestyles, many people like to travel.
11.0	They think traveling in own country is better than from traveling to foreign countries, while others believe that traveling to foreign countries is beteer than own contry. l stronngly agree.
12.0	Because traveling can widen the vision and alsp canimprove language skill.
5.0	First of all, as we knoaw, traveling to foreign countries can open us vision.
8.0	Because we can learn other contries culture and custom.
8.0	And also is help us to learn the history of other countries.
8.0	When wetake history lesson it help us understand it better.
8.0	For example,last year my firends go to travel from Spain, after she come backe she tell me the spanish eusually eat dinner is very late.
8.0	We abroadhile we traveling in own country we were don't know the custom.
5.0	Second, traveling to foreign countries can help us improve language skills that this will be of great help to our future work.
7.0	There is a good example from my countries celebrity famous person Jack ma, he has a good English language abillty, so he lerned a lot of knowledg abroad, when he cmoe back he
3.0	Some parents always to provide some bonus to thier children when they get high grades in school.
3.0	That shows that the parents really concern their children's grade.
11.0	However, personally I don't think this a good way to encourage school-age children.
11.0	there should be more effiective and variable methods to tell children that they have a good job.
4.0	To begin with, offering their school-age children money could raise a awareness that money is closely related to the high grades due to their poor recognize ablility.
8.0	What's more,children could cheat in some exams so that they can some fancy toys.
8.0	That wrong realization of the relationship between money and study can push them go astray.
8.0	So parents possibly push their children to go astray in that way.
4.0	Secondly, children would think gain that money is so easy to get which makes them take it for granted.
8.0	They would not cherish the money which thier parents earn it so hard.
8.0	And when they have money suddenly, they maybe don't konw how to spare it.
8.0	Damaging to their health and grade can be down result in lacking of self-contrl.
8.0	They can buy too many video games or snack.
8.0	So it is hard to monitor them how to use that money.
4.0	Indeed a postive feedback to their high grades can motivate children to study harder.
8.0	But that will lead children pay their all attention to thier grade and overlook thh others.
8.0	Grade is only a small indicator to value the performance in school.
8.0	Parents can't show too much attention to that.
8.0	Learing how to communicate with people, how to make friends is also important for the school-age children.
8.0	There is other ways can encourage children to study harder such as take them to travle or just spent more time with their children.
2.0	From what has been discussed above, I can come to a conclusion that giving money to chilidren when they perform well in exam is not a approprated method because that will cause misunderstanding of the relationship between money and grade.
3.0	Just as the ancient Greek scholar says, happiness is the ultimate target of one's life.
3.0	It is so crucial that almost every mortals spend their whole lives on seeking happiness.
12.0	In this modern world, finding a suitable job other than having a excellent social life is very significant to attain happiness.
5.0	To start with, people's work determines their life quality, which directly influence the sense of happiness.
8.0	To be specific, if a person manages to get a decent job with a bright prospect, it is more likely to gain massive salary and bonus from his career.
8.0	As we all know, Money is the financial basis of one's life, which determines one's life quality, allowing him to feel careless and relax most of the time.
8.0	On the contrary, ordinary people who possess limited wage are possible to struggle to make a living, not to mention looking for happiness.
8.0	For example, Tracing back to may school age, my family was always worried about the next meal for lack of money after my father's company broke down.
8.0	However, since we opened a little supermarket in the neighborhood and more money was comming to our packets, we moved to a bigger house in a rich region.
8.0	Furthermore, my parents did not have to be cautious about how to make a living and feel less stressful than before, allowing us to spend more time on going to the park and travel across the world.
8.0	As a result, we taste the sweet of life and feel the sense of happiness.
5.0	Besides, people are able to afford the sense of achievement if they can choose a adequate job.
8.0	To illustrate, apart form sleep time, work time occupies most of the life, as most of us have to work over eight hours to make a living.
8.0	If people can find jobs that to their tastes, it is likely they feel proud when they achieve something unique and great.
8.0	In this way, people will find their lives more meaningful and find the key to happiness.
8.0	On the contrary, if a person feels tedious and boring about his work, he is likely to lost and miss the direction of his life.
8.0	As consequence, he can hardly gain enthusiasm and pride out of his work and feel like wasting lots of energy and time on something he is not interested.
8.0	For example, my major is computer science, which is my favorite subject and I am willing to work as a software engineer for the rest of life.
8.0	Coding programs not only can make me indulged but also give me the sense of achievement when I conquest some technological problem.
1.0	To sum up, to get the key to happiness, people should find a job that to their taste.
1.0	Although social life may have significant impact on it as well, but people's career determine one's life quality and achievement.
12.0	Some people say that could be a motivation for children to study diligently.
12.0	Others argue that these monery would exert negative efferts on children.
11.0	For me,I think give school-age children money for their high grade is not a good idea.
5.0	First, this action would not bring benefits for children's mental health.
8.0	The reward might be a badly for children to work for merely money.
8.0	They would think wealth can solution everything, however, we should tell our next generation there are more things such as friendship, love are all can't purchase, it's all important than money.
8.0	Besides, childrens maybe cheat in the exam because their parents only care about their marks.
5.0	Second, children would fail to face with challenges if they only get rewards.
8.0	They would not to solution many problems.
8.0	One of my classmate, who is always the top 10 students in the exams, once lose this position in a quiz.
8.0	when she back home, her mother was angry and sad.
8.0	She was afraid of not performing well next time and refused to get lessons from the failure.
8.0	Finally she failed in the final exam.
8.0	As parents, they should stimulate their children with a hug or a love, give them more mental encourage when they failed or successed.
7.0	Depite I refuse to reward the money to the children,but i also think reward a thing is beeter
3.0	Recently,with the stress which people are under increasing rapidly,how to relax efficiently has become an importent issue.
3.0	Whether watching a movie or reading a book does better than doing some physical exercise?
11.0	In my opinion,it is quite true.
5.0	Here are some reasons to identify my point above.
8.0	First of all,watching a movie or reading a book could contribute a special situation which is totally different from your daily life.
8.0	Since life is the place where the pressure often comes from ,containing work and studyand so on ,it is importent  to try to get away from it.
8.0	During my life ,I would like to buried myself in movies or books when I am tired,imaging I belong to the world in the screens,which makes me feel easy and comforteble.
8.0	The second reason is that you can choose to lie on the sofa or the bad insteade of standing continuely.
8.0	There are also many kinds of other activities you are able to do,including drinking a cup of tea ,listening  classical music or having taste of some delicate snacks,which is more interesting than doing physical exercise merely.
5.0	However,some people have the other kinds of thought.
8.0	they might consider that doing physical exercise is the best way to relax your musle.
8.0	And it is also necessary to be exposed to the sunshine and the fresh air outside.
8.0	As far as I am concerned,what they say is reasonable,but we can addmore contions to improve the situation where the inside activities have.
7.0	For example,we can use the sbuild some construction which
3.0	Past several decades have witnessed the unparalleled development of society.
3.0	Meanwhile, our life style to relax has undergone profound changes as well.
3.0	It is widely admitted that movie or reading is a popular way to relax.
11.0	To me, personally, i believe that doing exercise is better than watching movie or reading books.
4.0	First of all, exercise can let people get more healthy body.
8.0	That is to say, by doing exercise, people not only relax themselves but become more healthy as well.
8.0	A good case in point, a study has done hy Harvard University estimates  almost 87% people through exercising can freefrom serious diseases such as cancer.
8.0	Furthermore, the result showa that individuals acquire better condition of mind by doing physical exercises than watching books or movies.
8.0	Hence, exercises can help people more relax than enjoying books and movies.
4.0	What's more, people can make more friends through doing exercise.
8.0	People are social animals , so they need some friends to share with their feeling.
8.0	To put it more concise, by exercising to relax, peple not only can reduce the pressurebut also can make more friends to share their sadness and bad motion.
8.0	Take myself as an example,when i am feeling very upset, i usuallygo to find some friends to play baseballs.
8.0	It is really an effective way to relax.
4.0	Irrefutably, coins have two sides, some people may say that people do not worry about either where to do exercise or find someone else to exercise with them.
8.0	Through watching books or movie to relax, they can just enjoy the ime to relax themselves, and they do not have to consider about these kind of problems.
8.0	However, the idea is hard to convince people due to the fact that sometimes individuals do not have opportunities to watching the content of books or movies what they want .
8.0	They will feel more upset ans even angry because they toally waste their time .
8.0	Have they gone to exercise , they will definitely do not worry about they dislike the kinds of physical activity owing to the fact that people choose he exercise they are good at.
2.0	All in all, for the reasons described above, i definitely believe that exercising is an excellent way to relax than watching books and movies.
3.0	When did you have a connection with your extended family recently?
3.0	Faced with the question, a lot of people have to think and recall their memeries for long time.
3.0	Even some of people have forgetton the experience for the question.
3.0	Therefore, in present-day society, the family become gradually less importany than the pasy because individuals have already had less connection with their extend family.
11.0	And my reasons and examples are as follows.
4.0	First of all, in order to rise living-standard,people are supposed to be preoccupied with their work and tackle many tricky bussiness.
8.0	Therefore, they would not have much time to spend on accompany with their extend family.
8.0	For instance, after graduation, finding a suitable and satisfying career cost my cousin's a plenty of time.
8.0	Therefore, with time going by, I had less conversation with my cousin and we could not maintain a imitate relationship.
8.0	Espically when he found his job, he worked eveyday.
8.0	Finally, our relationship become less important than it was in the past because of his busy schedule.
4.0	On top of that, with the development of techonology, it is extremely convenient and effective to make new friends and build up a wide-range social network.
8.0	Therefore, if we are in front of many troublesome dilemma, we could have more approoches to deal with them instead of only appeal to our extend family for assistance.
8.0	To illustrate, an application called Zhihu become popular in our daily life.
8.0	When a problem is occurring, we could post a website on the application.
8.0	And then, there will be a huge number of experts to help you solve your problems in second.
8.0	Thereby, more and more social people who could meet your satisfaction are occurring, and your extended family must become less important.
4.0	Admittedly, it is true that in the past if we want to visit our extended family, we had no alternative but to go through a long trip.
8.0	But now, we have a chance to use the smartphone and have a video call with them, which is convenient for us to have a face-to-face chace with them.
8.0	However, we still use the avune to contact with others instead of only our extended family.
8.0	What is more, in some normal occasion, we will forget to rely their messege,
2.0	In conclusion, from my persepctive, the extended family is less important than in the past.
10.0	For
3.0	Education have made a great contribute to the society.
3.0	Rencently, there have made a lot of controversies about ideas that give prize to children.
3.0	Some people hold the view that that school must take prize to all students.
3.0	By giving gift such as money or other things, more students likely to become prosperous in the future.
12.0	In following paragraphs, I will confirm present reasons to illustrate this perspective.
5.0	To start with, giving money to the children as a reward can stimulate children to shtudy harder.
9.0	When children  feedback of their hardwork , high ranked students always try more to get money and lower ones also try to get upper score to achieve this prize.
9.0	They try to do anything that is has a beneficial for them.
5.0	Futhermore, after finishing schools and unversity, finally they must enter the society and in it there are a lot of competitor for get money.
9.0	This trick help them how they can achieve their goals in society.
9.0	In society, there are numerous bigger problems and students have face them.
2.0	All in all, it  is highly beneficial to students.
3.0	Nowadays, many people worries that the Internet provide too much information, which can cause many problems.
3.0	There are various reason why they think so: Some teenagers access to so many violence on the Internet which makes them ignore laws and become terrorist.
3.0	Some may be deceived by others and are cheated out of money.
12.0	However, in my opinion, people cannot push Internet away just because of this.
4.0	First, people can learn many interesting skills which they cannot learn easily without Internet.
8.0	You can learn how to make cookies easily only by watching a vedio.
8.0	You can solve your math problem only by surching on the Internet.
8.0	No one may have to wait in line to sign for class to learn suchn thing.
8.0	The Internet does make our life easier.
4.0	In addition, only by using the Internet can we know things happening from distance.
9.0	For example, my uncle lives in America, and I am always worried about his safty.
9.0	I search on the Internet every day to find what is happening arround him.
4.0	Fuethermore, making new friends can be easier.
1.0	In conclusion, although the Internet might cause problems, it is much more benificial to people.
1.0	Thus, I advise people to  use the Internet correctly and enjoy the valuable information it brings.
11.0	Teacher is deemed as a career to impart knowledge to students at school.
12.0	Recently, a heated topic is about whether teachers should be paid as well as doctors, lawyers or business leaders.
11.0	In my opinion, I do not think teachers' payment should be high but should not be compared with other vocations.
4.0	Admittedly, some people may concern that teachers are devoted to teach students through their whole life.
10.0	They have to study and improve their teaching methods constantly, so they should be paid as much as doctors, lawyers or business leaders.
4.0	However, doctors, lawyers and business leaders are also devoted to their careers.
8.0	They should not only spend more time on learning about their careers, but also be more careful when they are working.
8.0	For example, doctors have myriads of operations to do during their life.
8.0	Every operation is vital to them because they are reponsible to the patients' life.
8.0	Once they are careless when doing an operation, they might lose their jobs and will not be admitted to the medical realm any more.
8.0	Thus, they should be paid high so that they could able to pay more attention on their work.
4.0	Moreover, business leaders have to manage big companies with many staffs.
8.0	They should make great stategy to run the business of their companies, also manage the people who are working in the companies.
8.0	It is of great requirement to make a company thrive.
8.0	The leaders should make wise dicisions
2.0	From what has been mentioned above, we can draw a conclusion that teachers should be paid high but their payment cannot be comparable with doctors, lawyers or business leaders.
3.0	With remarkable progress of travel economic, how to attract tourists became a vital question for the local government.
3.0	Some peole claim that government should make more advertisement to attract tourist.
3.0	But in my oppinion, government should improve the safety by hiring more police or improve the appearance by improving the old buildings and streets to approach the aim.
5.0	First, ensuring the safety and improving the appearance of old buildings and streets will be satisfied the tourist.
8.0	These satisfied  tourist  will tell the fellings to their friends or write down the feeling on their Moments and Blogs.
8.0	These behaviers can attract more and more new tourists.
8.0	Spend more money on the advertisement without improving the services and safety in the travel sites, the tourists which come here for the ads will be disappoint and leave a negative impression.
8.0	Moreover, they will let their friends or other users of the internet know it.
8.0	In this case, people will not come here anymore.
8.0	For example, the Jianghan Road in Wuhan, government protect it carefully, so the tourists here have a good impression.
8.0	Because they write a lot of blog with passitive words, more and more peole choose to come here when they come to Wuhan.
5.0	Second, the government improve the safety and appearance will be a important standard of tourist choosing the place they go.
8.0	Recently, the safety problem and the appearance is more and more important for tourist, especially the safety.
8.0	For example, during the New year's holiday, a lot of peole choose to travel instead of staying in the home.
8.0	But because of the dangerious of the  crowded people, more and more people perfer the place have more police.
8.0	Because the government hiring more police for the Llijiang this year, one more time of travellers choose it as their aim travel site.
10.0	To sum up, more safety and
3.0	Nowadays,some parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school .
3.0	They think it is an effective way to motivate their children to study hard .
12.0	Well I hold the opposite idea against them .
5.0	Firstly ,studying is a thing that will go through everyone's life which means that studying is a permanent thing not a temporary thing .
8.0	But parents'behavior like giving money to children to make them study hard won't garentee children enjoying studying, even leads children's value to a wrong way-I shpuld study hard not because I enjoy studying but I can get rewards from parents.
8.0	So the problem such kind of value contributes to students not enjoy studying in fact.
8.0	In addition , another problem this kind of behivor bring is that as the children grow up, they become difficult to be satisfied ,they will ask more and more ,and the parents will find is getting harder and harder to meet their children's meets .
8.0	Once parents can't meetb their children's needs ,children may even refuse to study hard ,such king of ending is totally opposite from parents' original expectations .
5.0	So as far as I am concerned ,helping children build up their interests in studying and encourage them when they make some progresses in time is the only correct way .
9.0	Here is an example : in some foreign countries ,parents will feed new-born babies a spoon of honey dropped on the page of book.
9.0	Through this way ,parents convey an idea to their children that reading books is just like drinking honey which makes you feel delightful.
0.0	Above all, it is totally wrong for some parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.
0.0	Parents should make sure that children enjoy studying ,if not they should try their best to help children build up interests .
0.0	For studying is a permanent job , the money it self  can only make children study hard temporarly .
11.0	When it comes to the issue how people can do when they found teachers or meeting leaders said something worry, perspectives vary from person to person.
11.0	Some people believe that they should interrupt the sp[eaker and correct them immediately or say nothing.
12.0	However, as far as I am concerned, people'd better wait until the class or meeting is over then talk to the speaker privately.
5.0	To begin with, interrupt others speaking seems not that polite, and if it just was the author's mistake, it might be an embarrassed thing.
8.0	Most people don't want others interrupt their speach becuase they may feel their authority are being challenged.
8.0	In the meanwhile, author can't make sure they are right and the speaker are worry.
8.0	Just imagine how awkward people are when they found the wrong people are thereselves.
5.0	Furthemore, saying nothing makes people lose the chance to show their thought and find the truth.
8.0	People always develop their ability during communication.
8.0	If they found something but don't say, it will makes their harder to find the truth.
8.0	When I was youny, I never say anything in class.
8.0	So my teather always ignore me.
8.0	Once I found my math teather made a calculated mistake which makes the answer worry.
8.0	I told my teather what I found after class.
8.0	In this way, my teacher found that I am good at calculate, and if  I didn't talk to my teather, I would always remember that incorrect answer.
7.0	In summary, from what have been mentioned above, we can conclude that th
12.0	When I' m woking, I prefer to have many different kinds of tasks to do and I can work more efficiently and achieve more.
12.0	If I do similar tasks all day long I would feel tired and I can't feel a sense of achievement.
12.0	So from my perspective, I support workers to do various tasks during the workday instead of complete similar tasks.
4.0	First, doing a vaiety of tasks a day enable workers to be more efficient.
8.0	Many reseaches show that human use different part of the brain when they are doing different tasks.
8.0	For example, human's right part of the brain is more active when they are communicate or writing, on the contrary, while we are doing logical works, the  left side of the brain is more active.
8.0	If we do the same job all day long the single section is  active all day thus  our attention can not be concentrated and our work efficiency can be low.
8.0	By contrast, if we do different tasks the active section of the brain can change, therefore we can easily concentrate on one task.
4.0	Second, if we can do many kinds of tasks one day we'll feel more sense of fullfillment.
8.0	Because doing various task need we to think from different pespective and aspect and even motivate our creativity, these abilities can also be strengthened by always doing a variety of tasks.
8.0	It will benefical to your future career.
8.0	What's more, if we finally complete these task a day we can learn more and feel more sense of achievement.
4.0	Finally, doing a similar tasks can easily get tired and people can be more likely to get lazy.
9.0	Similar tasks can be tedious if we do it all day long and may lose the enthusiasm of the job,then we may get tired of the job let alone the prospect of the job.
9.0	Howerver doing various task can be more interesting and challenging to us, thus inspire us to learn more and be more excellent.
2.0	Overall, doing various tasks a day is beneficial to one's ability and career development.
12.0	Many people nowadays will encounter many occasions that your teachers or your leader says somethings incorrect.
11.0	Some people may be in consideration of their relationships or careers and choose to say nothing.
12.0	However, as for me, I prefer to wait until the class or meeting is over and the people are gone, and then talk to the teacher or meeting leader.
4.0	Waiting until the the class or meeting is over and others are gone and then talking to the teachers or leaders is the basic respect to the teachers and leaders.
8.0	Because if you interrupt and correct the mistakes in front of others, the teachers and leaders will lose their reputation, and other people may be concern about their ability.
8.0	And that will be a bad situation because your teacher or leader may blame for you if they have narrow-minded and your career and study life may get worse.
8.0	Nevertheless, if we tell them their fault secretly not in front of others, that will be a total different result.
4.0	Also, interrupting and correcting the mistake right away have no benefit on your classmate and colleague because the drastic arguements will cost a lot of unnecessary time.
8.0	For instance, my friend Jack is free-spoken student, and he had a extremly violent controversy with his teacher on the class.
8.0	The discussion spent nearly half of the class, and obiviously at last the teacher could not finish her teaching task, so she decided to prolong the class.
8.0	Eventually, everyone in the class had no time for lunch and they were all angry about Jack.
4.0	As for saying nothing, it is the worst choice for us.
9.0	Say nothing is a choice that is not responsible for us and others.
9.0	Because, if we do not correct our teachers and leaders' incorrect opinion, they will continue to spread out the wrong information, and others may get wrong knowledge.
10.0	By and large, I will choose the second one
3.0	Nowadays, as we all know, there are many different ways for students to study.
3.0	And sometimes they may be assigned to finish the project.
3.0	So there is a type of situation, professors may require them to work together.
3.0	And this type of means are thought to be less effective for students to study.
3.0	On the contrary, I think working together as a group is a great way for students to learn more effectively.
3.0	Communicating with each other can widen their horizon and make the plans more bueatiful, and also the clear role in the team can make the work finished faster.
5.0	First, students can get new notions through communication with others when they work in goups.
8.0	In the process of communication, people will exchange there own ideas frequently, as a result some of them may realize the shortage of themselved and distance from others, than they may try to overcome the disadvantages, which might be the process of progressing.
8.0	Taking my own experience as the case in point, once when I was in the senior high school, we were required to finish a series of math questions by working together.
8.0	During the discussion with many other classmates I discovered many other thinkings to solve the difficult problem that I had never met before, thus bring me lots of surprising.
8.0	After trying to approach that, my ability to think with a more effective way had improved a lot.
8.0	Thanks to the groups.
5.0	Second, the task might be easier to finish in a proper way by means of working together.
8.0	This is because students will play clear roles in the teams, so that many tiny works can be done at the same time, which increase the vlocity entirely.
8.0	Taking my cousin's experience for example, when he was in the college, he usually carry on the projects by himself alone.
8.0	During that process he often left out many small things in the whole project, because of the limited time and energy of just on person.
8.0	When facing the multiple tasks, students' attention might be extracted and divided into several proportions, which might have much bad influence on the efficiency.
2.0	In conclusion, working together as groups is a more effective way for students to finish the difficult and multiple tasks.
11.0	From my personal perspective ,I fully agree such behavior.
12.0	As is known to us all,having little knowledge on how to use and save money and being too luxary are big problems of nowadays children.
11.0	And this behavior is a good solution to the circumstances.
5.0	First,this practice associate the hard work of children with the earnint  of profit.
8.0	So it can encouraging children to exert much effort and spend much time on the study .
8.0	Some may debate that this may cause an unpurifying motive of study and will give rise to the idea that the only purpose of study is geting money.
8.0	But I want to clarrify that this method will not supplant the way of invoking the interest to encourage student to study ,it just an supplement .
8.0	And see how todays school to forge student to study,the idea is a better one comprared to suppresing their other interests
5.0	What's more ,use this as the sourse of children's pocket money may make them understand that earning is not a easy process and each penny require hard work satisfaction of relaxing time and thus ,their hole of the pocket from which the money flow must be narrowed and needing .
10.0	And this may have further impact that they will treasure others' hard work ,including their parents.
2.0	As for the argument that whether it is proper to expose the children to the enviroment of money ,my answer is yes .
8.0	As the fast development of society ,children nowadays is much premature than the generation before .
8.0	And this method help them form the ideology of money at an early age .
8.0	Of course , education is needed to introduce them into a correct way of earning money and using money.
3.0	Currently, a contoversial topic has aroused heated debate: Whether people will spend less time cooking and preparing foods in twenty years than they do today.
3.0	Opinions vary from people to people.
3.0	Some claim that people will invest more time on cooking and preparing foods in the future because of the increasing awareness of physical health.
3.0	Howevr, I hold an opposite view that future people will value their time more and not waste their time on cooking and preparing food, since they will be overwhelmed with much more tremendous tasks based on current trend and the development of technologies to assist them to get rid of cooking.
5.0	First off, future people will live overwhelmingly hectic and hurried life, so they do not have the basic condition of cooking and preparing foods like today.
8.0	To illustrate, modern people especially those working and living in big metroplics are experiencing tremendous amount of assignments everyday.
8.0	It will be common that people have to work extra work.
8.0	After the whole day work and get home, they have already exhausted all their energy and time.
8.0	In this case, they will not do the cook by their own.
8.0	For instance, not only are my parents occupied with the countless tasks, but also they have other commitments and worries such as family, kids, mortgage and loans, all of which they need to spend time and energy on.
8.0	The time they can devote to the cooking and preparing foods is quite limited.
8.0	Therefore, my parents and I usually eat at the resturants, which saved lots of their energy.
5.0	Additionally, with the development of technological gadgets, some cooking devides will substitute human to prepare food.
8.0	To elaborate, there are already some kind of novel mechanic which can make some easy food.
8.0	Based on the current speed of the development of technology,  we can preview that the advanced mechanics which can cook diversity of delicious food  in the future and people can be liberated from the daily tedious cooking and preparing foods.
8.0	For instance, on the first Anibaba technology exhibitation, a group of scientists and cooks have successfully worked out an atonomous mechanic, which can make all kinds of food according the menu in 5 minutes, such as Chinese roasted duck, Dongpo meet and some original chinese food, without human supervise.
8.0	Moreover, it eliminates the process of washing dishes and owener can deliver a order to make food on time through smart phone, so when they get home, they can immediately eat the hot food.
8.0	So it is not exaggerated to say that some advance technology will take place human to make food.
2.0	To put it in a nutshell, I, personally, think that people will spend less time cooking and preparing foods in twenty years than they do today, because of their hectic life and advanced technology.
3.0	Issues related to news have never failed to attract people's attention.
11.0	When it comes to the globle  events, recently a hotly debated topic has aroused among the public: whether people should pay attention to the events happening around the world, even they will not influence our daily life.
11.0	Some may hold the view that people unnecessarily have to know such things that do not affect themselves.
11.0	However, I believe that knowing the globle events, people can obtian some benefits about their own life.
5.0	First of all, learning events from other countries sometimes helps us to build up the sense of happiness.
8.0	To be specific, in the world, there are still many countries suffering the war or some countries cannot avoid the gunshot case.
8.0	As a result, as the people living in the peacce country, by comparing the environment, they will cherish the surroundings more and appriciate where they are living in.
8.0	And then, after knowing that many other people who are suffering some life danger can still strugle to live, the people in the safe conditions will be more hopeful for their life and feel more happiness.
8.0	For instance, sometimes when watching the news that some countries in Africa are still fighting day and night, I am so happy that I am living in such a safe country where I can do what I want instead of worrying about my safety.
5.0	On the country, people can develop the responsibility of the country by knowing about the events around the world.
8.0	In details, for most countries, there are always some competition dispute between them.
8.0	And some times the speech or the decision from the leader of a country sometimes reflect their purpose for some strategy to aim at other country.
8.0	When people learn about the competition between their own country and other country, they will be starbon on their side to against other country's strategy by doing something they can.
8.0	Consequently, such behavior cultivate their responsibility to protect their country by their own ways.
2.0	All in all judging from all above, I strongly agree that people should know the events around the w
3.0	With the development of the culture and the science of humanbeings, individuals increasingly view the education of their kids as the most momentous thing.
12.0	To lead their children to the right way, some parents just tell their kids what to do, while other parents consider letting children make mistakes and learn from their own mistakes as the best way to educate.
12.0	From where I stand, I totally agree with the latter one.
12.0	My pointview will be illustrated in the following paragraphs.
5.0	First and foremost, making mistakes and learning from their own mistakes lets children remember it more impressive.
8.0	If the kids were only informed of what we should do or not, they would not experience the result of their mistakes so it hardly to understand why they should do it and will not remember it for long.
8.0	Take myself for example, when I was young, my mother told me do not play with fire on my own, however, I didn't listen to her and played fire with my friends.
8.0	After one time I hurted myself by mistake, I learned how fire would hurt me and never play fire again.
5.0	What's more, kids always don't like to follow their parents advices even though they realize what is the right thing to do.
8.0	Children would get bored if parents tell them a lot things that is forbidden or those things they should do.
8.0	Some kids may even do it worse with numerous warnings.
8.0	As my little brother, he never listen to his parents, and always try to challenge their words.
8.0	But whenever he made mistakes, he can learn a lot from it and did a quite well job next time.
1.0	Although letting children make mistakes and learn from their mistakes may let kids go through a lot of struggles which they didn't have to.
1.0	It maybe a challenge but I think it worth a lot for the deep impression and the explendid results it takes.
7.0	In conclusion, if I have a kids in the future, I will
12.0	Nowadays, with the rapidly progressing of the electronic technique, people's privacy face the more serious threat than ever before, so do the famous entertainers and athletes, more and more people attach importace to  the issue whether should the celebrities and athletes deserve to be safer protection.
11.0	I agree with this idea, it will benefit both the famous people and citizens.
5.0	To begin with, privacy is a part of the personal rights, everybody have the right to defend his own privacy.
9.0	No one will feel comfortable with someone hind in somewhere and record your routine detailed, what's your breakfast included about, where you plan to go, or what you said about during sleep.
9.0	If all of one's massages are exposed, he may destroyed by this.
5.0	Furthermore, if the media compete to gain more private information to draw spectators' attention, the content may presented on the media will be filled with those meaningless gossip massage, and leave no place for those indeed valuable news, such as the latest legisation, the new policy about children's schooling, the advertisments about pubilc benefit activities.
8.0	In this case, no one could gain some usefull information but those famours' privacy.
8.0	If you are a college student, and you want to search something involved your major to finish your paper and broaden your knowledge reserve, but after opening the webset, the colorful pictures written by  attractive words are all about those boring message.
8.0	With your long-time endeavor, the massage you find is obsolete.
8.0	Ultimately, students won't wrtie a satisfying paper, businessmen won't have a good command of the market condition, and the famours will live with pain day and night.
8.0	So it is our duty to cease digging out their privacy, for their dignity, and for people's happiness.
2.0	All in all, explore the famours' privacy undying is an irrational action, it will hurt the celebrities, and destroyed social discpline as well.
10.0	So their privacy is deserve to be protect.
3.0	Now, it's highly debated about what kind of job is more suitable for children.
11.0	Some reckon that children should choose the job that is similar to their parents'.
11.0	Others think that it's better for children to have a completely diffenrent job from their parents.
12.0	In my opinion, I approve of the former decision, because parents are experienced,which means they can provide efficent working suggestion to their children and it can also enhance the relationship between parents and children.
11.0	The following are my reasons.
5.0	First and foremost, the similar job with parents can help chidren solve working problems easier.
9.0	For example, parents are the computer programmers, and their children are working on software too, when children face the difficulty on encoding that is must sent to his boss tomorrow, they can just ask his parents immediately, because parents have been worked for many years, so they are experienced in technology.
9.0	Consequently, the similar job with parents is helpful for children to handle the difficulties.
5.0	In addition, working on the similar thing can heighten the relationship with parents.
10.0	Because they have more common topics to chat.
7.0	For instance, Finally,  although having a different job with parents can facilitate the ability of handling problems oneself,
3.0	Have you ever seen children getting from parents every time they got a high grades?
3.0	Have you seen children wanting to get money when they got high marks in the school?
3.0	Unfortunately, I have seen those happend every where.
11.0	I think it is not a right methods for parents to award their children.
11.0	There are two factors why I think in this way.
5.0	Initially, gaving money as a reward will form a twist children's review of marks, and once they cannot get money from their parents, they may decline the interests in knowledge.
8.0	And at that time parents who want to stimulate their children's interests in disciplines will fall in the half way or place a negative influence.
8.0	However, if parents make them love subjects from the bottom of their heart, they will always love it even without rewards.
8.0	For instance, my uncle always take my cousin to the museums or climb the mounts as rewards for her good grades in the school.
8.0	In the way, he will teach her knowledge of animals and plants.
8.0	That makes her interests in the nature and she decided to be major in botony in college.
8.0	And she knows that she should do better in all the disciplines she learned now.
8.0	Thereby, she get good grades every tests.
5.0	Moreover, it will make their children relay on tehm most.
9.0	For example, my sister always got money frome our parents.
9.0	Then she thinks that she does not need to go
1.0	Taking into all the factors mentioned above, we can safely arrive the conclusion that it is not good for parents offer their children money, when they get high grades.
1.0	This is becsuse they will twist their children's view of grades and make them relay on parents most.
3.0	Nowdays many parents have some ways to improve students'studying intrests.
8.0	For example,if students get high grade in school, parents will offer their school-age children money.
12.0	As far as I concerned, I support that this is a good way to let students are intrested in learning.
12.0	because money can bring children learning power   Everyone likes what through their own effect to get.
8.0	For instance,in our childhood,our parents all promised that if we finished this thing ,they wil give our the reward.
3.0	we hadn't sense what is correct or wrong in that age .
3.0	But we knew that we had benifit when we finished the test.
8.0	because of the reward, we will try our best to finish the thing.
8.0	this is why i think that it is good to offer their school-age children money for each high score they gat in school.
10.0	on the other hands
11.0	I think it is not a good idea.
11.0	Because Not only learning konwledge is for ourselves and our future.
11.0	But also there are not relationship between study and earning money.
12.0	There are two specific opinions below.
5.0	Firstly, the parents need to let their children to learn consciously.
8.0	Because is very important that parents can not take care of them all time.
8.0	They need to focus their own study by themselves.
8.0	There is an excample abou my friend.
8.0	The boy always depend on his parents and his parents need to help him to check his homework everyday.
8.0	Certainly, his grade is not very good.
8.0	In fact, this boy is very smart, but he is too lazy to study consciously.
8.0	He always study depend on what will he get, such as if he don't study he will get bed grades and his paren will be angry with him, so he need to study.
5.0	Secondly, parents need to let their children to know that their are not relationship between study and making money.
8.0	In our life, no one can get money by getting a good grade.
8.0	Chilren  need to know the right way to making money.
8.0	There is an excample of my sister.
8.0	Her parents always give her some presents or a few money if she get good grade.
8.0	She always think that she can only be good at getting good grades to make money in the future.
8.0	And she can use any way to get higher and higher grades,even cheating in the task.
1.0	Finally if children get good grades in the task, parents can give them properate precent to encorage them in the next excam.
1.0	For enxample, if children get good grades, parents can let them to eat dilicious lunch to show parents' happiness.
3.0	Teacher is an important and essential position in our society.
11.0	In recently social life, it is known to all that teacher's salary is not as much as doctors, lawyers or business leaders.
12.0	It is an unbalance distribution and I prefer that teacher need be paid at least as much as doctors and so on.
12.0	The statement of mine are showed in the following paragraphs.
4.0	Firstly, teacher play an important role in schools.
8.0	Teacher use their knowledge to teach students with selflessness and cultivate elite for our country.
8.0	If there have no teather, people may cannot gain knowledge in an easy and clear way.
8.0	Teacher is a job that need to be honorific and understand, so they are worth to acquire more paid.
8.0	For example, in my senior school, our teacher cannot been paid much, but they also teach us in a dedicated way without explain.
8.0	So they worth more salary and I think there has no doubt on it.
4.0	Secondly, teacher is a job that is so hard and difficult to gain enough knowledge to teach student.
8.0	More and more people do not want to be a teacher because of the salary and the high threshold.
8.0	For example, my uncle John had been a math teacher at a high school, he spend lots of time at get a teacher licence and be earnest and pay lots of attention on his students.
8.0	But his got few salary and cannot pay for his son's tuition.
8.0	I fell said about it and finally my uncle leaft his job and get a good pay from other job.
4.0	Thirdly, teacher spend is not less than doctors and so on.
8.0	Doctors help ppatient and teacher educate student.
8.0	They all make a big contribution for the society, so the salary they have need to be close to each other.
8.0	If they can not get what they should be paid, it may cut their rnthusiasm.
1.0	There is no doubt that teacher need more attach and more paid.
1.0	It is good for people to become a teacher and increase their enthusiasm.
3.0	Nowadays, many competences are regarded as indispensable abilities for those successful people.
3.0	Without doubt, leadership is one of these capacities and it plays an essential role.
11.0	And there is an argument.
11.0	Some people indicates that leadership comes naturally.
11.0	However, from my perspective, one can learn to be a leader.
12.0	I mean, the leadership can be learnt by promoting leading skills and personalities.
6.0	First of all, encouraging people to learn leading skills is a gateway to expand their outlook and elevate them leading awareness.
8.0	As we all known, leading skills refer to certain methods which could be acquired by studying and training.
8.0	For example, creating an ambitious goal, balancing the relationship among the workers, the proper distribution of assignment.
8.0	When one dedicate much time and energy to it, people will fulfill themselves success.
8.0	Take my own experience for example.
8.0	When I was a freshman of college, I was supposed to lead our classmates to attend a volunteer activity but I didn't know how to allocate different person in charge different groups.
8.0	From that case, it illustrates that learning some skills will promote one's leadership.
2.0	In addition, leadership could be learnt by enhancing personal charisma.
8.0	That is to say that the passion and attraction which team members dedicate to the mission can be reinforced by personalities.
8.0	For example, if one is modest about his or her achievement rather than showing off it, others will perfer to trust the person and support one's proposal.
8.0	If one is confident of the fulfillment of task, friends are more likely to follow him or her because of the positive influence the person bring them.
7.0	From these case, we can conclude the more positive charisma people have, the more
3.0	Nowadays，the increasing attention being paid to the pin money of children.
11.0	A problem comes with it that how to give your child money in a right way.
12.0	One of the ideas of pursuing all rounded pin money of children calls for parents should offer their school age children money for each high grade they get in shcool.
3.0	is that a good idea ?
11.0	I think so.
11.0	Children should though their own efforts to get what they want.
5.0	To start with.
9.0	it is a good way to make chlidren to get good grades in school.
9.0	For most of school age children ,they can not understand many throries that epress get a good grades is good for themslves,and they need a goal taht provide motivation to make them want to achieve this goal.
5.0	For the second reason,give money to children in this way can let them to know it is hard to earn money that result in children would use money correctly.
9.0	It is not easy to get a good grade,children have to hard working,and pay much attention to their shcool work ,and they will have no time to play computer games,and then if they got a good grades,parents will give them money.
9.0	They know the money is hard won,so they will treasure the money,it is also a good way to control children to use their pin money in a right way.
10.0	In a short,paren
12.0	I think it's not a good idea, parents should not give their children money for getting a high mark on their test.
12.0	Firstly, achieving good grades is our responsibillity for being a student.
11.0	Being a student, one of the main goals in our life is to have good grades, just like earning money for the family is our parents' responsibillity.
8.0	If you give a student money just for getting a high score, the student will have a feeling that everytime he\she takes a test is for the money.
8.0	For them, money may become a whip to keep them forward at studies.
8.0	Slowly, they might even forget their purpose as a student.
4.0	Secondly, score does not equal money.
8.0	As far as I'm concerened, money is just an ecouragement for the student.
8.0	What parents are doing nowadays is giving their children the feeling that you ought to give him\her money everytime he\she had a high grade.
8.0	Once you stop handing out money, the student will immediately have a huge decrerase on his\hers marks, due to the thought of score=money, for him\her the equation is nothing simpler than: no money then no score.
4.0	Thirdly, a lot of students have been given money at quite a young age, way too young to know how to use their money wisely.
9.0	A big problem for many families today is that they are raising their children up as rich kids, even when the family is poor.
9.0	And a main cause of the problem is handing out money for a good score.
4.0	Lastly, students need to be willing to study on their own, money isn't always the ultimate tool for everything.
9.0	If one student isn't willing to study on his\her own, no matter how much money you offer him\her is just not enough.
9.0	They might even become too relied on money, without it, they will not study.
2.0	In conclusion, we should not offer students money because it will lead them to the wrong path or even make them forget who they are in the society.
12.0	The topic are talking about that if perple will more helping the struggling strangers today, some people think it is true, because people who are struggling that need be help from each others, because they can get lots of help from each other, that will help people who are struggling that can get away frome the crises, but for me, I think it is totally wrong, because they will more stranger if some people give them a wrong choice.
5.0	Firstly, if lots of people give them help from lots of different ways, it maybe will make the strnagers more strange, because lots of people can give a people lots of different advice to help him or her but there wioll have some advice will conflict others, when it happen, that will make the strangers more hard to make the right choice,just like a choice question, all the answers are just have a little different between each other, then if you have a little wrong it will make you to do this question wrong, so maybe it cannot help the people who are in the strange, it is easier to let the strangers to make the wrong decision, may be it is a crises to the people who make the decision, so i think that people just to make choice by himself, it will be grate.
5.0	Secondly, if lotsof people help the strangers it will make the strangers like to rely on other people, they will be more lazy and make them rely on others help in the future, just like if you always copy your classmates in the quiz or tests, it will give you a good grades in the few days, and it will make you think that you always can get a grate grade in this class, then you don't review it, when the finals coming you may will fall on this final tests.
10.0	So as I say, strangers will not get more help form others people, because it will make the strangers get the wrong decision or make them like to rely on other people, that will not be a  good choice for the strangers.
12.0	I agreed with this idea.
11.0	The worker should have different things to do while they are working and they will be more satisfied with their jobs.
4.0	First,if a worker always do a simple job at work,they will get bored soon.
9.0	Just imagine you are doing the same things all day such as cleaning the windows,pick up the things on the tables,answer the phone,it is very terrible.
9.0	Doing different jobs can make the workers happier and they can be more satisfied with their jobs.
4.0	Second,there will be more challenge to have different tasks.
8.0	If you are playing a game,will you stay at the same round all the time?
8.0	Of course not.
8.0	Once we finished this round,we are willing to have another round,which is totally different to the one we played before.
8.0	Why?
8.0	Because we can gain self-satisfaction from different tasks we finished,but not from the things we are doing again and again.
4.0	Also,we can learn more things through different jobs .
8.0	After a whole days's working,we can tell ourselves proudly that I have learned something new today.
8.0	It is true that do similar task all the time has it's advantages.
8.0	It is more simple for a man who has done it thousands of times.
8.0	Also,we can finish the job better because we have more exprience.
8.0	Also we can gain satisfaction from the tasks we finished perfectly.
8.0	However,different jobs means that we can have some different skills.
8.0	No matter how difficult it is to finish a totally different task,we can still learn something different.
1.0	All in all,it is great to do  similar tasks at workday,we can do better jobs,we can finish them easily,ut it is better if we can try different types of tasks.
1.0	We won't get bored soon and we can have self-satisfaction through different jobs we finished.
3.0	Parents are alway confused about the method which can efficiently motivate their kids to study hard, it is disfficult to get everything in control.
3.0	Recently, one topic is highly debated: whether or not parents should provide their children money when they obtain high mark.
3.0	Some people advocate this idea, while other hold an opposite opinion.
12.0	From my perspective, giving kids money for each high grade they acquire in school should be encouraged among parents.
4.0	Firstly, there is no doubt that children are prone to feel more motivative.
8.0	Having kept the money which they may get after getting high grade in their minds, they are more likely to try their best.
8.0	With the money, kids can buy something they have loved for a long time.
8.0	Taking my brother as an example, my parents promise to offer him money if he can reach good mark in the final exam.
8.0	These two months, he has worked so hard in his study.
8.0	He is alway troubled with English, hence he plans to review the textbook every morning to improve it.
8.0	He told me secretly last night that he want to but a robot which is fascinating and a little expensive.
8.0	In order to purchase the thing which he is eager for, he puts all his heart to study.
8.0	In a word, using this way to encourage children to work hard is of great efficiency.
4.0	Moreover, parents can have kids known the value of money.
8.0	Teenagers seem not exactly realize how difficult for parents to earn money, as a result they don't have the awareness to cherish money.
8.0	However, when their parents offer money to them as encouragement, they will understand that it is not easy to get money.
8.0	It is beneficial for them when they leave school and then go to the workplace, they should not be innocent any more.
8.0	Besides, having better understand on their parents can let the relationship between kids and parents more harmonious.
4.0	Admittedly, this mehtod seems to empahsize the significance of money, but all adolescents should know about the fact.
9.0	No one can deny that we work hard for better life and money can support the better life.
9.0	They will definitely be exposed to the complicate society, so realizing the importance of money is necessary.
2.0	In conclusion, praising children with money is extraordinarily effective, also it can bring a lot of other benefits to the whole family.
11.0	With the education is produce , more and more people will get more and more knowledge .
12.0	more and more students  will get  high grade .
11.0	many are concerned about the students should or should not get some parents offer them money for each high grade they get in school .
11.0	i think this is a good idea , because , it is will encourge students to study .
10.0	it is interesting for family .
5.0	The start with ,  i think some parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school will encourge the children to study hard .
8.0	when i was very young , i ofter get high grade in the schoool .
8.0	my mother usullay give me much money .
8.0	i think the money is very good for my life , so l like it .
8.0	then i will study hard .
8.0	the grade is higher and higher , my mother is very happy day by day .

8.0	it is good for  my life , when i am growm  .
8.0	then my parents do not carry about  my  life how to spend my own money to live in the city .
1.0	so , i think this some parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school is a good idea , it is good for our life .
1.0	let the family is interesting .
3.0	Issues related to the habit have never failed to attact people's attention.
3.0	When it come to the mordern life, recently a hotly debated topic has aroused among the public: whether young people should develop the ability to plan and organize in addvance.
11.0	Some may insist that young people should do whatever they want at anytime.
11.0	However, as far as I am concerned, I believe that young people should train their such abilities.
12.0	And my points of views will be illustrated as follow.
5.0	First of all, planning and organizing helps young people to solving affairs more efficiently.
8.0	To be specific, for most young people, especially teenagers, what they are caring about is not only about their study that extra-intrest classes and entertainment are also important.
8.0	As a result, if teenagers can have a good plan in addvance, they can manege the time well like deviding it into pieces of part and finishing one thing during a piece of part.
8.0	And then they will not waste too much time that they should have finished their complex stuffs, and all their work can be solved rapidly and efficiently.
8.0	For instance, when I was about 15 years old, I am not only focus on my school work but also leaning electronic piano and basketball.
8.0	Because I had to go to school on weekdays, I just managed my time well to divide the Saterday's time to train electronic piano in the morning and play basketball in afternoon.
8.0	Eventually, I can efficiently solve all my work on Saterday and make good use of the Sunday to have fun.
5.0	On the top of that, learning to plan and organize precipitate a better career for the young people in the future.
8.0	In details, as young people, one day they finally enter the society and do their job.
8.0	If young people can develop such habit during the young time, in the future when competing of a work post, they can solve problems methodically and step by step and then achieve the fianl goal well and fast, which provide the boss a better felling and it is eaier for him to approve their capability and hire them.
8.0	For example, my cousin developed the habit to make good plan at a very young age.
8.0	Last year after graduatin from university, he decided to enter an international Internet company.
8.0	During the intership period, his good ability to organize events in an orderly manner helps him to win from the severe comitition with many other job seeker and obtained a well-paid job.
2.0	All in all, judging from all above, I strongly agree that young people should learn to cultivate the ability to plan and organize.
11.0	I agree this statement,in the past many people depended too much on their parents to make decisions for them, they think it's better than make decisions by themselves.
11.0	Today, young people are better able to make decisions about their own lives.
5.0	First, many young people don't like to make decision by themselves, because they think what make decisions it's a difficult thing.
8.0	They don't know how to make decisions, such as they like this or like that, they don't know how to make decisions , and don't know what is better than other one.
8.0	So they will to depends on theri parents , most of young people think their parents have many social experience, they knoe what is better.
8.0	For example, when I was young,I went shopping with my mother, I didn't know  what shoes I should buy, I asked my mother and my mother give me a answer.
8.0	But most of young people think their parents isn't well, they don't like their parents's choose.
8.0	So they want to make decisions by about their own lives.
5.0	Second, following the society's changes, young people have to make decisions about their own lives, they want to be more independent and stronger in the society.
8.0	"When the young peolple make decisions, their parents often said :""You must make decisions by yourself, you have grow up."""
8.0	Today, many parents encourage their children to make decisions , and they believe that they can do the better choices.
8.0	For example, my friends invited me to take a part in his birthday party, but my sister invited me to watch movies.
8.0	I don't know how to choose .
8.0	"Then,I asked my mother, my mother didn't give me a answer, she only said :""If you like play outside with your friends ,you can go."
8.0	If you want to watch movies, you can go too.
8.0	"I don't know what you like ."""
8.0	So I had to make decisions by myself.
8.0	Finally, I make decisions by myself, you can feel happy and relaxing.
8.0	It's important that you make decisions after , you can know the society's experience and how to make choose.
2.0	Therefore, today young people are better able to make decisions about their own lives.
3.0	How would you feel when you have trouble finishing your math homework but your friends are too poor in math for you to get help from them?
3.0	How would you feel when you want to attend a competition but you have to gather three students to participate it while all your friends have little interest in it and you can't get help from them.
3.0	All above are associated with friends.
12.0	From my perspective, friends that I can get help from are more important than friends that I can have fun with.
5.0	For one thing, it is really hopeless when faced with difficulities with no one around to turn to.
8.0	I have to spend a lot of time searching for solutions all on my own and this doesn't ensure me to make it in the end.
8.0	For instance, if a student has trouble finishing the math homework which he has to hand in just tomorrow or his math teacher will call his parents, he will have a really hard time trying to figure out all the problems just on his own for all his friends that he usually play with are poor in math and care nothing about study.
8.0	It is not until this moment that he realizes the importance of the friends that he can get help from.
5.0	For another, I can enjoy myself by wathcing videos and playing computer games if there are no friends that I can have fun with.
8.0	For example, there are often cases when all my friends are busy working on their own business instead of having fun with me.
8.0	However, it doesn't upset me at all since I have lots of ways to have fun just by myself like going to the theater to watch a movie, staying at home playing PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS and so on.
8.0	Frankly speaking, I can get more fun playing with myself than playing with my friends.
8.0	As a result of it, having no friends that I can have fun with is not a big deal for me.
3.0	With the development of the society and the economy parents pay more attention to their children's future jobs.
12.0	Most of parents will think that choose jobs that are similar to themselves is very beneficial because if children's father or mother does one kind of job, there will be very good atomosphere of this kind of job and in the future they will give a lot of useful advice to these children's career.
12.0	All of these will help these children have a very clear future.
5.0	Firstly, if parents specialize on one kind of job the whole family will be full of this kind of atomosphere, which will let these children have more pros than other children.
8.0	Take my brother as an example, his father and mother were all lawer so every day he has a lot of chance to contact some information about law from he was a little boy.
8.0	Moreover his parents also readed some books or magzines about legislation; my brother choose one book randomly the book is about legislation; and his parents always took him to some friends' home who were also lawer.
8.0	As a result, my brother know a lot about the lawer than these children whose parents were not lawer and he had great interest in the lawer job.
8.0	If his parents were not  lawers, he will not have opportunity to contact these knowledge and people about the legeslation.
5.0	Secondly, if we do the same job with our parents, they can give us a lot of advice when we practice this job.
9.0	My friend is a basketball player and his father was also a basketball player.
9.0	F
3.0	As we can always hear in our dayly life, parents always give their kids awards like money to show their happiness to the kids,and give the kids power to study more hard.
4.0	I think prising is good.
4.0	Firstly, we are all kids once.
8.0	We should know that kids have no mind in the distinguish which things are good for themselves.
8.0	They only know that: the candy is sweet, the toy is funny and the game is interesting.
8.0	So, the awards is one kinds of guiding for the children to grow in a right way, in a better way with the determination of their parents.
4.0	Some people maybe think that parents have no right to determine which way the children choose.
10.0	But in fact, my brother Tan's experence shows me another  aspect of this topic.
4.0	Tan's parents working in another city far away from his hometown.
8.0	He grow up with his grandmother who love him a lot.
8.0	So at his fist 10 years in this world.
8.0	Good grade means money, toy, and new games.
8.0	But his grades is good, and he is hard working at school.
8.0	It ism changed at his 11 year in this world.
8.0	His father, which is my little uncle, and this mother came back to our hometown.
8.0	They bought a resterant and spend their whole time in this resterant.
8.0	But Their bring Tan to their house and grow him but themselves.
8.0	As I said, my uncle and his wife use their almost every time at their job.
8.0	So nobody will concern about his grade his study now.
8.0	After 3 years later.
8.0	His grade was not good any more, and he has found other things to interest in---games, novels.
8.0	He will ask his parents to give he money without reason.
8.0	I think he is distoryed by this parents.
0.0	From the story of my brother Tan.
0.0	I think you can give the idea that :The worst thinks is let them grow without guide.
0.0	The prising and punishment is both method to teaching, so I think it is good.
0.0	money may bne
3.0	To lillustrate the working environment whether acquires versatile techniques or only one specific skills, workers may varies in oppinion, even though different types of assignment involved in tasks need more interdisciplinary kownledge, which take efforts for individuals to cope with, colorful work choices provide entertainment for all working kinds.
3.0	bringing sense of achievements among the works.
11.0	In my perspective, being a worker, a more challenging job may better inspire me, satisfying me more easily.
5.0	To begin with, different types of assignments during a whole workday provides various ppportunites to change individuals direction, avoiding the circumstance of being bored about the repeated task.
8.0	Since different tasks may including not only intelectural activity, but also physical involvement, which create a break during the work, making the  offiice time less intense.
8.0	It also can be applied to the blue collars' works as instead of moving all day, they can find a time to sit down to using computers or other office work, which in turn relief their physical pressure.
8.0	Take my brother as an example, he was an manager in a bussiness company, sitting in office for half of his life dealing with statics and charts on computers, lacking exercises made him fat and unhealthy, however when he converted to the sale appartment, he needed to do some shoping and marketing job with different corporations, since that, he walked and rode everyday from one place to another but he found satisfied again.
5.0	Secondly different tasks require greated abilities, making the job unique and unsubstituded, since people feel like they are distinguished in their position, they can naturally access to a sense of achievement.
10.0	As we all kown, simple jobs such as car plant workers on streamlines can be replaced by anyone for the technique it requires is limmited.
7.0	The unstable job have a commen factors that is is
3.0	Every parents want their children have a good grade in the school.
12.0	however,many students do not like studing any more.
12.0	As a result,some parents come up with an idea that offer their children money for each high grade they get in school to encourige their children study hard.
12.0	Actually,this idea can be helpful for their children temporary.
12.0	But in my opinion,this is not a good idea.
6.0	As everyone know,study hard is a duty for students.
8.0	If parents encourige their by offer money,their will think study is meaningless without money.
8.0	And one day they have not money after they get a good grade,they will stop studing.
8.0	As far as I am concerned,parents should tell them that study is benefit with theirself
11.0	Traditionally, doing homework and taking part in organized activities are considered as wise ways to help children become ready for social life, interllectually and emotionally.
11.0	However, I believe that more time should be given to children to do whatever they want, for it can cultivate their independence, stimulate interests and enhance family relationship.
5.0	Firstly, allowing children  to do whatever they choose to do can better cultivate independent ability.
8.0	If only focusing on the school arrangements, doing the fixed homework and participating in organized activities, children would lose the ability to arrange their own activities and manage their time nationally.
8.0	Once children have been accustomed to the arranged life, they would follow rules others made, rather than breaking them up.
8.0	What`s more, children`s innovation will be harmed greatly if everything have already been set for them.
5.0	In addition, giving children more time to do whatever they like is beneficial for them to stimulate interests.
8.0	"On the one hand, just as a saying goes ""interesting is the best teacher""."
8.0	Only when children do the things they like can stimulate their talents.
8.0	On the other hand, children  will stick to what they are fond of and learn a priceless lesson that preseverance will pay pff, and our lives abounds with such examples.
2.0	In the end, family relationship can be significantly boostes, if parents give more free time to children.
8.0	If parents set too many restrictions on what chikdren what to do, children would gradually fell disgusted about the limits.
8.0	Suppose a young child goes back home after a whole day`s study, feeling exhausted phisically and mentally.
8.0	However, instead of caring about his emotion, parents still push he to do his homework.
7.0	In this case, childen will fell
11.0	Nowdays some parents believe that they should give their school-age children money for high grade ,others do not think so.
11.0	However ,in my opinion,I aggre with the parents who give their children money when they get in school.
6.0	In modren society ,people have more and more pressure ,specially high students ,to illustrate ,they should do lots of homework in order to meet their teachers demands .
8.0	What is more ,high school students spend all time in school so that they have no time to look for part-time job to earn money by themselves .
8.0	In addition,giving their money for each high grade is able to encouage them to studay better,maybe it can avoide them getting in trouble because they lack of money .
8.0	Last but not least ,I think school-age children are too young to make monry independence.
10.0	To sum up ,I am conform that parents could give their children money during they get in shcool.
3.0	With an increasing amount  of awareness toward education, children's life become a hot spot in the world.
3.0	Some children are required for  doing homework or participate in activities in order to enhance their knowledge.
11.0	On the other hand,some parents give their children more time to do whatever they want.
11.0	I agree with the latter and this statement can be proved by analyzing the following reasons.
4.0	In the first place,  letting  children do their favorite things can cultivate their good personality.
9.0	This is due to the fact that children do whatever they want, they will be more willing to communicate with their partners, which allows children become more opening and outgoing.
9.0	Therefore, children will build a good personality.
4.0	LIfe abounds with example.
8.0	My sister is in the primiry school, my parents never forced her to do things she does not like.
8.0	My sister like dancing and playing chees, so my parents support her and encourage her to study hard.
8.0	In the process of doing favorite activities , my sister is willing to talk with others.
8.0	She always find funny things from her activities to share with everyone, So my sister is a outgoing and kind girl.
8.0	Thus, doing favorite activities can help children build a temperate personality.
4.0	In the second place, if children can do whatever they want, they will expand their horizon, This is qwing to the fact that children are able to do things they like, they will be more willing to obtain more skills, which contributes to enlarge their knowledge.
8.0	Therefore, children will absorb more knowledge from their favorite activities.
8.0	For instance, my brother likes travelling, so his parents always take him to travel around the world, diring travelling the world, brother viewd a lot of culture and local conditions,and then, he took his views into his dairy.
8.0	Finally, his diary obtain the second reward in HUBEI province.
8.0	So children do thier favorite things can enlarge their knowldge.
7.0	All in all, doing the activites that children like will be beneficial for them,
3.0	In the dog-eat-dog society, every parents want to let their children success.
11.0	As a result, parents want their children have a faster growth pace than others have.
11.0	Increasing number of parents think that they should let children make mistakes and learn from the mistakes.
12.0	However, some parents still exsit that children can't make mistakes.
11.0	I, however, don't  think that kids should't make mistakes.
4.0	First and foremost, in the daily life, making mistakes is enavoidable.
8.0	No matter it's among parents or kids.
8.0	We may make mistakes for many reasons, careless, unconsious or just forget to do something.
8.0	Nevertheless, those mistakes are meanful, we can earn benefit from them.
8.0	Take me as an example, once i left my homework home.
8.0	this mistake is really awful for my parents.
8.0	As a result, i certainly been punished, the punishment is i can't watch TV for whole week.
8.0	I was really upset can made a promise, if i make this mistake again, i will give some more serious punishment to myself.
8.0	One glad thing is that after that event, i never forget to take my homework to school afterward.
4.0	Next, there is a old saying, failing is the mug to cultivate success,also the mistakes.
8.0	i'm the child who is bold and aggressive.
8.0	in every competition, i want to be the best, i can't stand any failure.
8.0	When i was in primary school, we have a contest about the scientific knowledge, before the contest, school gives us a list of book, that booklet told us what we need to prepare.
8.0	All of my competitors worked really hard in order to win.
8.0	Nonetheless, i made a wrong mistake, i'm so confident that i think i don't need to study for the competition, i'm knowledgble.
8.0	As you can imagine, i lose the game.
8.0	After the game, i had a self-reflection.
8.0	i found that i'm not houmble enough.
8.0	But something cheerful is that i learned from that impressive experience, being houmble to everything.
8.0	I made progress because of that.
4.0	Indeed, some people say that too many mistake will destory children's confidence.
10.0	what i want to mention is that now we should use the force of parents, parents should offer some encouragement to children when they are anxious.
2.0	Above all, what i want to conclude is that let children make mistakes
12.0	Recently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people: whether it is better to relax by a movie or reading a bookd than doing physical exercise.
12.0	Some claim that doing physical exercise can meke them more relax than reading a book.
12.0	However, contrary to their view comes my perspective that watching a movie or reading a bood is more effective way to relax.
11.0	My point can be elaborated as follows.
5.0	To begin with, people will forget all the unhappy things when they are watching movies or reading books.
8.0	To be more specific, books and movies can create a world for readers so that people can immerse themselves into the books and movies.
8.0	They will imagine that they are the characters of the books and they are taking some adventrue in a magic world.
8.0	In this case, people's mental would get fully relax.
8.0	On the contrary , physical exercise cannot make people forget their circumstance and just tired their body.
8.0	For example, I always saw the series of movies, Harry Potter,  when I was upset.
8.0	I will imagine that I was a little wizzard in that magical world and took adventures with potter.
8.0	Becase I was really into it, I forgot the upset and became happy again.
8.0	My mental got relax and all the pressure were gone.
8.0	However, if I did some phsical execise, it just made my body tired and did nothing with my mental relax.
5.0	To be followed, people can have a comfortable enviroment when thay watch movies or reading books.
8.0	To illustrate, when people watch moives or read books, they always find the place which is quiet and comfortable.
8.0	What's more, they can decide how they read books or watch movies.
8.0	For instance, they can lie on the bed or just sit on the floor when they are watching movies.
8.0	These kind of freedom will make people more relax.
8.0	On the contrary, if people do some physical exercise, they have to go to the public area such as gym or running route.
8.0	In these places, people are limited by the common ruler such as they cannot do something which will bother others.
8.0	This ruler will meke people feel unconfortable.
8.0	For example, when I want to relax myself, I always go to my room.
8.0	Then I can read a book llying on my bed with my cat lie behind me.
8.0	This environment makes me confortable and I can conrol all the things in my room.
8.0	Then I will be fully relax after reading a book.
1.0	In conclusion, people will forget the unhappy things and get mental relax when they are watching a movie or reading a book What' more, when people are reading a book, they often have a more confortable environment than doing physical exercise.
1.0	Hence, it is better to relax by a movie or reading a book than doing physical exercise.
3.0	There is a heated discussion among the topic that whether it is better to choose jobs that are similar to their parents' jobs.
12.0	Some think that parents can provide suggestion if their kids choose the same job while others hold the opinion that children have their own mind to decide which job to take.
11.0	From my perspective, I think that choosing jobs that are similar to their parents' jobs is a lot better.
5.0	First of all, children can get help from their parents when faced with difficult problems.
8.0	Owing to the fact that parents have done their jobs for many years, they have more experience than their children and they can give solutions that can surely solve the problem.
8.0	For example, if one has a lot of trouble teaching his students, he can just ask his parents who are both teachers and gain the ability to pass on knowledge and learn how the students think.
8.0	It is far more easilier and efficient than just searching for ways to teach all on his own.
8.0	Besides, it can help him gain more confidence by doing his work well and encourage him devote himselve in his job.
5.0	Secondly, parents can provide opportunities that can really benefit their children.
8.0	Since they have worked for a long time, they know many people who are related to this job.
8.0	They can provide chances for their children to develop his ability as well as get more money.
8.0	For example, if one works for a company and his parents are just workers in this company before, his parents surely know ways to seize the chance to go abroad for further study.
8.0	The company will pay the money and he can get more knowledge to work for the company and get well paid.
8.0	Choosing a job that are similar to their parents' job can really benefit themselves.
2.0	Last but not least, choosing job that are different from their parents' jobs is definitely a great challenge for most people.
7.0	Since many people have trouble when they leave college to get into the
3.0	Relaxation is a very significant part of our life.
3.0	When we are busy with our studies work or missions, we need to relax to work better later.
3.0	However, we have plenty of ways to relax such aswatching movies , reading books or we can do some physical exercise.
3.0	It is hrad to say which way of relaxation is beeter.
3.0	Reading book or watching movies is mental relaxation.
11.0	And doing exercise is physical relaxation.
11.0	If I have to choose,I will say that the latter method is beeter.
5.0	For starters, people can release their pressure when doing physical exercise.
8.0	Everybody has pressure but too much pressure may be bad for both your body and will.
8.0	Therefore it is of vital importance to set out some of the pressure.
8.0	And doing exercise can help us.
8.0	For example, when we play basketball ,we need to use many part of the body and in this way the speed of the flowing blood will increase.
8.0	The rate of our heartbeats will increase as well.
8.0	Therefore, we will feel happy and incitant after the exercise.
8.0	We will feel much more relaxed than before.
5.0	More importantly, doing physical exercise is also good for the brain.
8.0	It is another part of our brain that controls our movement.
8.0	When we are doing sports, the department that we use to work rests and another department is stimulated.
8.0	We can use the brain properly and efficiently.
8.0	The time when we do sports we can also think also other things.
8.0	It's also a kind of relaxation.
0.0	However , it is true that mental relaxation like reading a book or wtaching a movie make us relax a lot as well.
0.0	They make our mind peaceful and wise.
0.0	We keep think  but for other thing.
0.0	We can experience the emotion of characters and writers.
0.0	Our mood keeps varying with them.
8.0	After a movie or a book, we may have a lot more profound thoughts about life and the universe.
8.0	We will not feel tired but contented afterwards.
8.0	Different people may have different anwser to the question like there is a thousand Hamlet in one thousand's eyes.
7.0	But I think exercise
3.0	Ther are many ways for students to study.
3.0	One is work together as agroup and the other one is to work individually on ther own.
3.0	These two methods are often discussed by people and they both have some advantages.
11.0	From my point of view, I think that the working together may be a better method for students to study.
5.0	First of all, students who work togther to work on a project can learn how to cooperate with each other and work efficiently.
8.0	If students have to work together to achieve the same goal, they must know clearly what there duties are and do their best.
8.0	When working as a group, every members in the team has a sense of duty since everyone' s effort can directly interfere with the whole team.
8.0	So student will tail with team members and disuss how to do their job best.
8.0	And during this process they can learn how to discuss their problems with other people and learn to work together as a team.
5.0	Secondly, ork as awhole team can increase their study interest and therefore increase the study efficiency.
10.0	Several students study together  would make study less boring since they could talk with each other and turn to their group members for help when they encounter hard problems.
7.0	While study alone needs people to pay attention to the borinf
3.0	With the high pressure of social competition, a feeling of anxiety about education sets in.
3.0	Parents have never been more concerned about their children's education.
3.0	As a consequence, parents are going out of their ways to motivate their children to be more engaged in studying.
3.0	Using money as a stimulus is one highly debetable method.
3.0	Some may assert that this kind of awardness is misleading and might lead children to be too money-oriented.
3.0	Yet, I confirmly believe that money could serve as an advisable award for studyin diligently.
12.0	Meanwhile, it can help children to establish a rational value for money.
5.0	In the first place, giving children the money can be regarded as a reward for all the efforts they made and can motivate them to study harder.
8.0	Since children are having award for their work, they are more likely to feel a sense of achivement and be more willing to put more time and energy into it in the future.
8.0	Take my own experience as a example.
8.0	When I was in high school, whenever I won the first place in my class in an exam, my parents would give a certain amount of money to purchase what I wanted.
8.0	I felt much motivated since I could achieve my goal and earned mysely some enjoyment through my own efforts.
5.0	On top of that,money is the most common retribution in the society and there is no way to deny it.
8.0	And many school also provide schoolarships for students who achieve high academic grade.
8.0	Awarding children money for high grade could help them to establish the notion that money must be earned by one's own work and the more work you put in, the more reward you will get.
8.0	This is healthy and beneficial value for children to form.
8.0	Additionally, it may lead the children to cherish their parents' money and work more.
7.0	Judging from what I have stated above, I think its safe to say it
12.0	Child education is a common problem that every parants will face, they both wish their child can have a felicity life, some parents believe that their children or child cannot make mistakes,however, some families think it is a good way for young people to habe mistake, also they can learn from the mistake.
11.0	In my perspective, parents should  allowing child to make the mistake and leading them learn from the mistakes , so that their child will reduce the rate of making the same error in future, and make the child know what is responsbility.
6.0	first and foremost, mistakes are benefitial to young people's growth.
8.0	When people in a young age, they are easy to make mistakes in different areas for instance, dealing with the relationship with others, studying problem during the school.
8.0	these problem are very common in every person's life.
8.0	But most important for kids is to learn from it, for instance, if a kid have a argument with other classmates in school and they even got a fight, after this events they must be punished by teacher or their parents, however, they both know how to deal with the relationship with others, and in future study or work, he may have a good relationship with others.
8.0	In the contrast, if a person never experience this kind of peooblem, and he may don't know how to get alone with others, in the future he may have argument with his collgues or boss, which will bring him a big trouble In a addition, having the mistake can cultivite the kids' responsibility.
8.0	every time we have a problem, there must be some comsequences that we need to take.
8.0	For instance, if we broken others window we need pay for it, or be late for the work or class, we will be punished on our grade or salaries.
8.0	For child, it is a good for them to know they need to be responsiable for every mistake they made.
8.0	Take my own experience as example, when i was 8 years old, I was addicted to the computer games, and there is a big exam coming soon.
8.0	However I did not choose to review, I still pleyed the vedio games after school.
8.0	The result is obivrous I fall the exam, and I have to take the responsable for playing games before the test.
0.0	eventually, mistake is helpful to establish the children's responsiilty .
0.0	All in all, although cjildrens mistake may cause huge trouble for the then and the parents.
0.0	However.
0.0	I think it will bring more benefitial to the children's growth, to establish the sence of responsibility and to learn from the mistakes and prevent making the same mistake again.
12.0	Nowadays, many young people tend to do many different types of works to get the passion of working.
12.0	So as a young man, I prefer the statement that workers are more satisfied when they have many different types of works to do during the workday than when they do the similar tasks all day long.
4.0	On the one hand is that doing different types of works can easily get more passion on working.
8.0	Working on the same tasks can easily make people get bored, and it can be easily distracted by something else because people always do the same works will take less care on their tasks.
8.0	But if I get different type of tasks, it will force me to keep more focus on the task I am doing right now.
8.0	Because the fresh thing make me feel stressed, and some proper quatities of stress can make people get the passion to overcome it.
4.0	On the other hand, doing different types of works can let people get more responsibilities on his company.
8.0	If people have more kinds of tasks, it will help him to understand how other departments work and how the company it works.
8.0	For example, people in the marketing department can try to join the design of the company's products.
8.0	In this case, not only the person in the marketing department will understand the difficulties the technical department are facing, but also he can give some advice on the favor of the customers which can help the product get better.
8.0	With the more efforts he put in this product, the more feelings of pride and responsible he will get.
4.0	Further more, doing different types of works can let people know what they really like.
9.0	Not everyone can know what they really like or what is their talent.
9.0	And by this chance, it can be helpful to personality.
2.0	So as I say, I prefer the statement that workers are more satisfied when they have many different types of works to do during the workday than when they do the similar tasks all day long.
3.0	Recently，people life become very modernly.
11.0	Young people should have the ability to plan and organize by their own.
11.0	Particulary， someone points out that， they think cause of modern life is vary complex， young people do not need to have the ability to plan and organize.
11.0	They parents can help them to do that.
11.0	But I think modern life is complex， so， it is essential for young people need have the ability to plan or organize by their own.
5.0	Firstly，modern life is complex， young people need learn how to plan and organize by their own.
8.0	They can not get the plan and organize from their parents all life.
8.0	They should know how to ability to plan and organize.
8.0	parents can not follow you all life.
8.0	When their parents leave， they will lose the ability to plan and organize.
8.0	For example， when you go to college， you need choose a school and organization.
8.0	Now your parents can instead of you to choose.
8.0	And after your college， you need find a job and you need a plan for your life.
8.0	Now your parents can not instesd of you to make any plan and organize.
8.0	And now, you also can not make plan and oganize.
5.0	Secondly, if young people have the ability to plan and organize, they can cultivate ones own independence.
9.0	When young people learned how to make plan and organize by their own, they can use their own independence to do lots of other things like studing, working.
9.0	Independence is  important for young people.
1.0	In summary，young people to have the ability to plan and organize is a helpful thing for them.
1.0	For these reasons, I agree with the statement that cause of modern life is complex， it is essential for young people need have the ability to plan and organize.
3.0	Is today's world, which is full of new opportunities, more beautiful that ancient times?
11.0	I think so.
12.0	There are countless new things to be enjoyed in the world of modern society.
12.0	It is obvious that people nowadays has gained lots of fun from them.
10.0	Internet, better medical care and cars are three major things that changes people's normal life and gives them satisfaction.
5.0	At first, Internet has totally transformed the world.
8.0	People can gain so much useful information on the internet.
8.0	Take me as an example.
8.0	When I was doing a final paper about my major, psychology, I searched on the website of a famous paper database called SCI.
8.0	Also, I made appointments with my professor on Wechat so that I can communicate with him on time.
8.0	I downloaded five papers from SCI which were helpful for the theme of my paper, and every time I finished a paragragh, I would ask my professor on Wechat when and where to meet him for further advice.
8.0	Finally, with the useful papers and punctual appointments through internet, I finished my paper and got a high mark.
5.0	Secondly, better medical care released people's pain from diseases.
7.0	The number of long-lived elders is increasing owing to developed meadi
3.0	Nowaday, teacher assign a lot of intreasting tesk for student ,many studence like work with the grop, and other people like work along. l agree to work with the grop.
5.0	nowadays, most people like with the grop to work because they can interapt each other, when they have a problem they can ask for others to help them.
9.0	For example, when l study Engelish l often forget some gram when l study along nonoe can help me and also it is very bring because noone can talk to me, if l work wite the grop l can ask for him, and anytime the can remid me which one is important.
9.0	So l think with the grop have a lot of benefit.
5.0	On other important  reason is wite the grop we can lear some kowleges and also we can share some experence, For illustate we work with the grop we can lear varity of knowleges and also we can share some experence, when l have some problems l have never passt l can thrount someone experence to soive this problem.
7.0	So l think with the grop l can lear more
3.0	This day and age a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate which aspect  government should improve to attract tuorist, hiring more police  to guarantee safety or improving the appearance by boost the old buildings and streets.
3.0	Opinion vary from person to person.
3.0	Many popele claim that government should improve safety, which is most important for tuorist.
3.0	However, contrary to these poeple's opinio is my perspective that it is improving th apperance of the city that can attract more tuorists.
11.0	My point will be elaborated as follow.
4.0	To begin with, improving the appearance by improving the old buildigs and strees can attract more tourist.
8.0	Because compared with a city which has a real mess street, cleaning and beatiful streets will facilitate tuorists to get a better mood and give them a good impression.
8.0	The more streets are cleaned, the more tuoristw will happy to be there.
8.0	Compared with hiring more police to enhance the safety, bosting the streets will be more effciency.
4.0	For examle, last summer i wanted to go another city for treaveling, but i do not konw which city i should choose.
8.0	Then my friend David told me that  i should go to HangZhou city when he known my puzzle.
8.0	Becaue HangZhou city's street is evry cleaning and beautiful whihc made him feel very realxing.
8.0	As a result i choosed Hangzhou as my destination.
4.0	What is equally worth discussing is that it is enhancing the old building that can attract more tourist.
8.0	Because, improving old building can help a city build up a good reputation which will atrract more tuorists who are interested in old building.
8.0	compared with hiring the poluiTake my city as an expamle.
8.0	I lived in Beijing and our government  invest a lot of money to improve the Great Wal, which attract a lot of journalists to report it.
8.0	Then our city was famoused of The Great Wall and more and more poeple  travel to Beijing to see The Great Wall.
2.0	In conclusion, i am convinced that it is enhancing the appearance by improving the old bulding and streets that can help government attract more tourists
12.0	When people use the Internet to search imformation they need, the piles of information will be appeared in front them.
11.0	The imformation may useful, rather some of they not.
12.0	Gradually some people begin to have the opinion that the information in Internat may creat problems when you search some problems.
11.0	But in my opinion, the Internet could provide more uesful things than the unsless.
4.0	First and foremost, in the Internet we could get the imformation instead of asking other people which may creates more problems.
8.0	As for my friends, they always went to other country.
8.0	Searching imformation from Internet was a basic skill for them.
8.0	In the Internet, they could get the price immedientely and get comparision as soon as possible.
8.0	If they do not ues the Internet it will creat more problems when they constrast the hotel by telephone.
4.0	Besides, although when search from the Internet people may be trapped in the useless information,people also could be traped when they search the imformation form the books or videos material.
8.0	In this case, searching form the Internet is more easilire then other methods.
8.0	As for me, once I was looking for the detail of a formula.
8.0	At first I was search in the books, but it takes me three hours to get nothing.
8.0	Then I search from the Internet after half an hour I get the key to the equation secessfully.
4.0	Although it is problems in the Internet, it cannot be avoid searching from the Internet with the progress of the scioty.
8.0	It is better to study how to get the useful imformation in Internet is vital.
8.0	WIth technology get more smart, we could get the search engine in everywhere like the libary.
8.0	We could get the books we want though the engine, but in this progress we would face the problems.
8.0	Studying how to solve them rather than complaining about the problems is a wisely way to the methord today.
10.0	So I think
11.0	To address my opinion, I tend to be in favor of the opinions of celebrities do have more importance to younger people than older people.
11.0	Ther are couple of reasons for this tendency from my perspective ,as in interest-orientation,accesses to the information of their beloved idols and financial factors.
4.0	Younger people can be divided into two types in my view:Children and adults that are perfectly capable of working and studying independently.
4.0	First, let us talk about Children.
10.0	they are underaged, incapable of dealing with problems on their on,let alone making decisions among the classmates or friends, they can be easily affected by others,never mind have own perspectives on currently affairs.
4.0	"Second,is adults,or just say youth,this large proportion of people are now the primitive part of the society,they have lots of ""friends""need to be made,it is the most effective way of blending in,both in workplace or social place."
9.0	"It may bring them benefits to just talk with the ones have ""common interest"",it can help them break the ice between  each other."
9.0	Also having access to the other's workfield.
4.0	On the contrary,older people are less interested in making new friends who may bring advantages to them,with the increasing life experience,they are more likely to have intimate firends, especially those from way back ,like primary or secondary school.
9.0	they believe that kind of friend is the most valuable ones.
9.0	They can seek advices from the close ones just like family members,Instead they would give positive and constructive opinions to them ,helping them analyze both merits and dimerits,so to them ,it is more important than anyone else's suggestions.
2.0	In conclusion ,I think the views of celebrities whether crucial to younger generation is based on the age gap,sure
12.0	Family is very important for us, but whether or not the extended family also impotant for us.
12.0	Some people think that the extended family are not significant now than in the past, but some people claim that the extended family are more crucial now than in the past.
11.0	Personally, I believe that the extended family are more important now that it was in the past.
4.0	To begin with, no matter our parents or the extended family, we have the same bloodhoud.
8.0	For example, when you meet some troubles in other city, your aunts and uncles in that city, you need someone help you to solve this problem.
8.0	Even though, you have friend in the city, but they are not your family.
8.0	If that problem connect with their profit or harmful, they could not help you.
8.0	However, if you ask the help for your aunts and uncles, they are completely help you, because you are relatives.
4.0	Secondly, the extended family are our backgroud that can protect us.
8.0	For instance, when your sister get marry with others, one day they are fight for argue.
8.0	However, her husband will think about her extended family, if he hurt your sister, not only your parents, but also her extended family, like grandparents or cousins will help your sister.
8.0	So the extended family is also very impotant.
4.0	Adimittely, the extended family are more crucial now than in the past, but maybe nowadays the extended family are not important, because some relatives are afraid of help that you ask.
9.0	For example, some relatives want to rasie money to change a big house, but they will not ask the relatives to raise the money, because they think the relative is very complex.
9.0	So they could get help form their friends or classmates before rather than own family.
2.0	In summary, I believe that the extended family are very imporant now than it was in the past, because we have the same blood and can protect us.
12.0	Nowadays, the imprtance of being success has be widely-known by most people, how to become success is always not a cold topic.
11.0	Some people arguee that get on well with many is always more important than study well in the school.
11.0	In my opinion, study is the most improtant part to become a success person.
5.0	First of all, study well in the school is the basis to gian a better job in the future.
8.0	The acdamic knowledge is the fundamental part to shows your ability to big company.
8.0	so taht they are more likely to hire you.
8.0	With no acdamic support, no one would like to have you as the employee.
8.0	Take my friend Alice as an example, she is bad on study but have a rich daddy who recommend him to go to a big company.
8.0	However, during the interview, the interviewer found out that she got horrible acdamic knowledge and rehuse to recruit her.
8.0	Therefore, we can clearly see that study is more improtant for a success in a future job.
5.0	Secondly, studying hard in school gives you a more professional insight on choosing a better job.
10.0	The society is risky even though in the labor market, many companies have wrrong directions on the company's developement, they won't give you an ocuppation that not fit to you.
12.0	I agree that people are more willing to help the stuggling stangers today.
8.0	In the 21st century,people are more creative and clever who become more rich and pitying.
8.0	In China,you could read heaps of help events on newspaper.
8.0	And now,there are many charitarian around the world.
8.0	They are the pioneers in helping struggling strangers.
3.0	Many people would say that we are not able to know the things will not affect our daily ife because those things are really far away from us.
11.0	I agree that we shouldn't know about the events might not be close to our life.
11.0	After all, as a ordinary citizen of China, I don't think the political news such as who is going to be the president of Fracnce will lead to any harm to me because I will not go to that country in a short time.
11.0	However, it is necessary to know about the global events.
5.0	Firstly, knowing more global events could improve one's social skills.
8.0	By knowing more things that are happening around the world, you could have more topics that youcould disscuss with others, which will make others have the thought that you are really knowledgeable.
8.0	People who also care about the global news might talk and share thoughts with you.
8.0	With communicating with more people, your social ability will be advanced and you could be better fit into your job after graduate from the school.
8.0	Besides this, you could also make many many talented friends and your career life could be better.
5.0	Secondly, if you know many worldwide events, your understanding of the world could be enlarged.
8.0	Many global events could enlarge your envision.
8.0	For instance, I like to read the news on the websites, and I have the opportunity to have a clearer understanding of the environmental problem such as the green house effect, the invention of the new technology like the new phones, and the social problems which are not obvious in our life, like the poverty in the mountains and their medical and educational problem.
8.0	By knowing these,  I could have a further understanding about the development of the society and be benifited from it because I could apply them and combine them with experience.
2.0	In conclusion, although there's no need for us the to know the global news, namely they might not have any negative influence to ourselves, coupled with more topic with others, the deeper understanding of , makes a strong case that it is important to know the events around the world.
3.0	I think that parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.
3.0	Now as most parents just support a child, they are apt to do all they can for their kids which leads to the children's dependence and lack of experience and common value.
3.0	Hence, we have seen various social problems such as drug abuse, computer addiction and so on resulted from teenagers.
11.0	To change the phenomenon, what parents can do is educating kids to experience and comprehend from mistakes in it.
5.0	Making mistakes is the most valid and directest way for children to know how serious the mistake is and remember not to make it again.
9.0	For example, if George Washington hadn't destroyed his father's cherry tree, maybe he wouldn't had known the importance of honesty and being careful.
9.0	Similarly, children learn more from making trouble than just reading books.
5.0	Also, learning from mistakes leads to the sense of awe and respect.
8.0	If a kid ate too much snacks so that he was too full to eat at lunch.
8.0	It is reasonable for parents to educate him to respect the grains ang the efforts spent on the meal.
8.0	with time going by, right value natrally builds in his mind.
3.0	Our lives brimmed with every kind of pressure.
3.0	Some pressure come from the schools and companies where we have to finish tons of work in order to get a decent grade.
11.0	Some people agree the point that doing physical exercise can help us relax because doing sports is a good way to relieve the stress.
11.0	In my opinion, watching a movie or reading a book will be more efficient to relax than doing any physical exercise.
6.0	We only want to relax when we are physically or mentally tired of doing the work.
8.0	When this comes to us, exercising can help us nothing but increasing tiredness and stress because we have to pay all attention on the sports we are doing in case of injuries.
8.0	In addition, a fierce sport will make us more tired.
8.0	It can be seen by the moment after we end doing the exercise that people just want to take a shower and go to bed because they are even more tired than before.
2.0	In contrary, watching an interesting movie or book is a splendid way to relax or release the pressure that the school and the company brought to us.
8.0	A good movie or bookcan bring us enjoyable joy and have enough relaxing time because we do not need to do anything but open our eyes during the time of watching movies.
8.0	Thus, our tiredness and pressure can be perfectly released by this activity.
8.0	Besides, we really can learn from good movies and books which are instructive and are filled with morals.
3.0	Recently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among the public: Whether people spend less time cooking and preparing foods in twenty years than they do today.
3.0	Opinions vary from person to person.
3.0	Some people claim that the people today spend much time on cooking and preparing foods.
11.0	However, I would stand on their opposite side and I believe that it takes less time for people today to cooking and preparing foods than before.
5.0	First of all, the people today have large of works to do than before which means they have to cut the time for cooking and preparing.
8.0	This is primarily because the competition is more significant than before and if the people who do not work hard in their field they would be dismissed.
8.0	So everyone works hard which results in a situation that they choose fast food to save time.
8.0	For example, my professor has to hand papers regularly.
8.0	So he spends his most time in the lab to research in his field.
8.0	When he feels hungry, he will go to KFC and buy a hambarger in our unniversity.
5.0	Further, the people today is willing to enjoy a higher quality of life that the people in the past is hard to experience.
8.0	It is largely since the most of paople today have enough salary which support them to enjoy a delicious meal in the restaurant.
8.0	And going to restaurant for business or relasionship is gradually becoming a common scene nowaday.
8.0	For instance, every weekends, my family will go to local restaurant to have a tasty meal.
8.0	We will talk about recent events and exchange insights during meal.
8.0	Having meals outside has became a part of life to my family.
1.0	To put it in a nutshell, I firmly believe that people spend less time cooking and preparing foods in twenty years than they do today.
1.0	This is not only because saving time for work but also enjoying life.
12.0	Friendship is indispensable in our life,and it do bring happiness to people.
11.0	"However, there's a question:""Is it matters more to maintian an old friend's relationship than to make new friends?"""
12.0	"My answer is absolutely ""Yes""."
4.0	Admittedly, we can get pleasure from the freshness by making new friends.
10.0	However, the relationship among old friends is more likely to play an important role for one's happiness.
4.0	First of all, old friend is the person who understand you the most.
8.0	We have friendship with our old friends for a long time, so they know our hobbies and characters well.
8.0	Also, we don't to worry about the communication topic between us.
8.0	Take my own experience for example.
8.0	The day was my 16th birthday and I had appointment with my old friends as usual.
8.0	To my great surprise, when we reached the restaurant, the waiter showes me to a room full with the balloons and the food I liked.
8.0	I didn't konw that gift before, but my old firends are familier what I like so they prepared this birthday party for me in advance.
4.0	In addition, old friends are more loyol to you than new ones, which means whenever you have problem,they will always stand by you and support you.
8.0	For instance, there's a time when I got a severe illness and stayed at home.
8.0	My friend Lucy, who has made friends with me for ten years, not only brought flowers to see me, but also she took the textbooks to teach me the school course patiently.
8.0	I was so appreciate that she can spend time to look after me.
8.0	If it's a new friend, they may not even know I got sick.
0.0	To sum up, the ability to maintain a long-time friendship is more significant to me.
0.0	It's my old friends that give me the warmth and security.
0.0	And I believe that old firneds will be the ones that stay with me the lonest.
11.0	I can't agree with this statement which is a little ridiculous for me.
11.0	In my opinion , tempting as the claim that people may feel better when they just lie on a sofa to watch a movie or reading a book ,we should be more active and do much exercise.
6.0	In this world where we can see increasing amount of skycrapers built from ground ,everyone feel burdens and pressure, the time for us to exercise or deeply breathe is less.
9.0	we can release negative emotion by doing physical activities,it's not easy like just watching movies but it does  bring much benefit to our health.
9.0	In this process ,you can feel sweat falling from your face to ground .
7.0	another fuction which physical exercise has is broaden our circle of friends,through the process of exercise,we have more chance to communicate with other people
11.0	I don't agree with the statement that it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing phisical exercise.
4.0	Firstly, watching a movie is a really tired thing in my expierences, so I don't believe that it can make you relax after study or doing other daily jobs.
4.0	Secondly, reading a book is somehow a little bit similar to watching a movie.
8.0	The only difference is whether you watch it on your mobilephone or you just watch the paper version.
8.0	If you watch on your mobliephone, it cannot make you feel relax but even do harm to your eyes and make you feel tired too.
8.0	Or if you read something difficult to understand, it is impossible for you to relax, isn't it?
4.0	Thirdly, I would like to say why doing phisical exercise is better for relaxing.
8.0	Because most of the time we feel tired is our brain feeling tired.
8.0	So, watching a movie witch needs to think as well as reading does nothing to this.
8.0	Doing phisical exercise is just the using of body, so it is efficient for us to relax our brain.
8.0	If you can play a sport very well and have a great competition with your friends, it will make you feel more interesting and gather a lot of pleasure.
8.0	In this way, you may feel more relaxed than just running or doing other sports by yourself.
4.0	Finally, I have to say that my opinion may not suit all people and all of the conditions.
9.0	If you just have done some cleaning or other heavy jobs, doing exersice is obviously the wrong thing you need.
9.0	Just sit for a while or take a nap may be better than any of the above.
2.0	So, if your brain feels tired, just do sports.
3.0	From my percpective.
12.0	whether the encouragement of giving money to children is right is relevant to the age of the children.
5.0	If the child is in primier school,it's just a good way to make them more active and serious in study and prevent them from being addictid to something like computer games.
10.0	There is no need to worry that the child would be greedy or random about money as long as the child is of that age and is well derected by their parents.
5.0	As for the tennagers in middle school.
8.0	It's of vital importance to aware them of the true meaning of studying.
8.0	this is a time when they should know what they need to do and learn to study efficiently by themselves.
8.0	the later they understand that,the more harmful it will be to their future development.
8.0	giving money to them for getting good grades is not longer suitble,for it block their thought about more important things and result in the delay of the date when they grow up to be rimed in mind.
3.0	Have you ever seen that some people bought a product because the advertisement of the product is great but the product were not as good as the advertisement claim?
3.0	Some people in this society believe that most advertisements make products as same as they really are.
11.0	However, when it comes to the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better, I strongly agree.
11.0	There are three aspects that help me to demonstrate my idea.
5.0	First of all, there must be many people that purchase products because of their advertisements.
8.0	But after people buy the peoducts, most of them aare not as same as the asvertisement, usually worse.
8.0	Then they will fell really disappointed.
8.0	For example, my mother had bought a radio because the radio's company put the advertisement of the redio on the streets.
8.0	Then my mother saw it.
8.0	She thought it was really great.
8.0	But when she got it, the radio was not as good as the advertisement claimed.
8.0	It would make a really loud noise when it worked.
8.0	But the advertisement said it wouldn't make such noise.
8.0	Also, the advertisement said it would work at least a year.
8.0	However, my mother just use it for a week, it was totally broken.
8.0	Unsupriseingly, my mother was really disappointed.
5.0	Furthermore, the competition of products' companies is become more and more fierce.
8.0	Maybe there are some companies want to make more profits so that they will make the products on the advertisements seems better than they really are.
8.0	For instance, my friends father is a boss of his company.
8.0	He always made his product on the advertisement as same as the product really was.
8.0	However, his company's profit become fewer and fewer recently.
8.0	He decided to make his product on the advertisement seem better than they really are.
8.0	After that, his customers were mush more than before.
8.0	Then he was become more and more rich though this way to advertise his product.
10.0	Fina
11.0	With the development of education and technology, the youth now can have better education and attain more acknowledge.
12.0	There is a hot debate about whether now the young people can make their decision independently or not.
11.0	Some people say the young people now can make their decision individualy.
12.0	Others might say the situation stays the same nowadyas the young people still depend on their parents to make decision.
11.0	As far as I am concerned, I agree with the front one.
4.0	First, nowsdays the parents are open and wise.
8.0	In the past, due to the chinese traditional culture which is a little bit conservative.
8.0	Parents held the absolute authority, the young people are not allowed to make their own decision.
8.0	However, nowadays since the increasingly developed education people are taught to be open and the family statue of parents and kids become more and more equal.
8.0	For instance, in the past, the society is patriarchy, kids must absolutely follow their father, they do not have the authority to say no to their father.
4.0	Second, nowadays the parents are focusing training the independent ability of their kids, so it is more likely the parents will let their own kids to decide individualy.
8.0	For instance, since I was 8 my parents always led me to decide what I would wear tomorrow and make me decide what I will bring during the school and family vacation.
8.0	When I grew much older,like now, I will independently decide what I eat every day and where should I spend my money for in case I do not have enough money at the end of the month.
8.0	The life experience I have, the way I deal with my life, you can say my parents make me have the ability to be independent and strong.
4.0	I admit that you might say there is still a lot people who depend their parents to make the decision.
8.0	However, there is always a pattern for the kids like this.
8.0	The kids who are spoiled are more likely lose the ability to decide for their own.
8.0	Their life since they are kids are all handled by their parents.
8.0	So if you put them into the society they will suffocate and panic,because they grow in the greenhouse, they are used to have the help of their parents.
8.0	They can live without the parents.
2.0	To include, I agree that the young people now can make their dicision on their own.
3.0	Whether or not government should provide it to the public with no cost is a heated debate.
3.0	On the one hand, some people believe that government  should provide free internet and roads.
3.0	On the other hand, some consider that government provide should provide toll internet and roads.
11.0	As for me, I am the favor of former.
6.0	To begin with, for poor people, their aren't able to pay internet fee and roads fee because their don't have high salary.
8.0	For example, people spend a lot of time using network such as study, work and enternment.
8.0	Their place need to use network.
8.0	People spend money on a lot things.
8.0	If interrnet is free, people's life change convenient.
1.0	Second, charne-free policy allows more people to enjoy internet-based public services.
1.0	Under the encouragement of cost-free policy, an increasing number of people will be more willing to get sccess to the internet adn then benefit from governmnet services which is potimized by the internet.
10.0	At prasent, many un privileged people are kept from using internet.
3.0	It's all common that all people would like to have a job.
3.0	However, when people have acquired a secure job, different people may have different points of view about their next choices.
9.0	Some of them may be willing to search for another job that more suitable for them.
3.0	While as far as I'm concerned, I'll make the decision to take my present job at once.
9.0	Here are the following reasons I take into consideration.
5.0	First of all, a secure job, or in other way a stable occupation, is more possible to provide you as well as your family a happy life.
8.0	A stable job offers you an opportuinity to get regular salary, though very little.
8.0	With this money, you may be under less pressure that how to pay for huge costs of various fees of your family, and may even win some extra money due to your storage.
8.0	Maybe ten years later you must be surprised to find that the money your possess are ample enough to purchase a car with high quality.
5.0	Next, it must take a large sun of money and extra time for you to pursue an idea job, which you possibly cannot afford.
8.0	You  should first consider the fees for the trips you come to your location as well as you come back, and there exists an possiblity that you have to compare several companies before you could select a more satisfying one, which means a huger cost of money.
8.0	Given that you doesn't own your personal job and stable incomes, the heavy fees above are likely to be your burden and confuse you whether to go on your searching.
8.0	Morever, according to the fact metioned above, you are sure to be very exausted after a few long trips, which can also somehow influence your physical and mental conditions when you are faced with an interview.
10.0	In conclusion,
3.0	When it comes to dream, different people have different opinions.
12.0	Thus, a controvsial topic has been aroused: should people follow their dream even if the dream is too far to reach.
12.0	Some claims that we should chase the realistic goals.
11.0	However, contrary to their view comes my perspective that everyone is supported to follow their heart no matter how hard to achieve the goal.
12.0	My point is well elaborated as follows.
6.0	To begin with, it is the ambitious dream that can encourage us to try our best to success.
8.0	To illustrate, the long-range dreams always serve as the stimulation to constantly urge on people and give us the huge of sense of achievement.
8.0	Therefore, when people faced with the difficult in the process of chasing goals, it is less likely for the people who have the ambitious goals to give up.
8.0	However, if people merely set the easy achieving goals as the fear of failure, chances are that they won't make process.
8.0	For example, when my sister is five years old, she wanted to become a speaker.
8.0	Given that she was a stammerer and she chould even speak clearly, my parents just persuide her to give up this dream.
8.0	However, with the encourage of speaking around the world, my sister always mimics the vedio of success speaker, stands in front of the mirror and practices 5 hours a day.
8.0	10 years pasting, she now can speak confidently and logically.
8.0	and she always repre
2.0	In addition, the most important thing people can obtian from the dream is the process instead of the result.
10.0	To elaborate, when people are chasing the dream, they have to spend more and more time enhancing themselves insted of doing unmeanful things, learn plenty of skills to macth the goal and improve their courages to face failure.
7.0	Gradually, they may
10.0	"From my point of view,the answer is absolutely ""yes"",my reasons are presented as belows:"
3.0	With the development of the society,we are now so closely connected,which indicates that to help struggling strangers is to help ourselves at some time.
3.0	For instance,when you come across someone who is screaming in water and is drowning,he is likely to be somebody around you,like your relative or your college.
10.0	Obviously is that it don't take you much effort to give him a hand,but it really helps a lot,especially he may be your fellow.
5.0	Also,the society we are in now is the best throughout the whole history.
8.0	People are better educated ,thus having better personality than ever.
8.0	It is not far to seek that the society requires people to lend a hand to a struggling stranger as much as he can.
8.0	Normal people,especially the young,are as responsible as the great ones.
8.0	When an accident happens and the driver along with the passengers calls for help,the witnesses are certainly willing to call the ambulance and the police to make an effort to help them.
8.0	Rarely will people just walk away,which is considered ugly.
5.0	Last but not least,people today are more capable to help those in need,which meas usually what the struggling strangers need is just something you don't have to put into so much effort.
9.0	Contrary to popular belief,all he needs may be just a warm hug.
9.0	It is the thought to help that really counts.
10.0	As has been remarked above,it is clear to see that people today are actually more willing to help the struggling strangers.
12.0	Generally, parents believe that giving their school-aged children money may hence children's motivation to study hard.
11.0	However, this solution probably will have potential negative influence on children's attitude to study.
5.0	Personally, i think that this measurement's disadvantages outweigh than its' benefits.
5.0	There's no doubt that most students can get high scores if they are willing to bury themselves in study.
8.0	So what really matters is their attitudes to study.
8.0	I confess that money can get a school-aged student turn off his computer and start to prepare for exams temporarily.
8.0	But the strategy does not change students' attitudes to study.
8.0	They still hate to study as long as the money is not sttractive to them.
8.0	So the strategy can't work long.
8.0	Once their children lose the desire for money, they will return to playing.
12.0	As far as I am concerned, I think this is not a good idea to encourage the school-age children to study hard.
8.0	Although giving moneny to the children perhaps can encourage them to study hard, it will bring more disadvantages than advantages.
8.0	Firstly, the chidren have no concepts of the count of money, so they may fling their money around or buy some expensive toys, which they can not afford.
8.0	Secondly, if a kid takes too much cash, she or he will be robbed, even hurted.
8.0	And some senior students will collect the protection fee from that kid.
11.0	I do agree about parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.
11.0	The reasons are as below.
11.0	First of all,every single person make mistakes during their whole lifetime.
11.0	And the more you failed earlier the better you do  in the future.
11.0	As we can look around,you will find the so-called successful person are almost sucks in the childhood or have been through extremely unbearible problems.
11.0	That mistakes we have made can finally become our own wealth.
12.0	So,as you get the wealth as soon as possible,the more closer you are towards success.
5.0	"And also,ther is an proverb says that ""failure is the mom of sucess""."
8.0	It indicate that there is a lot of things that we can learn from failure.
8.0	As for myself,i failed to get an satifactory score about two years ago when i took TOEFL test for the first time.
8.0	Actully i feel quite disappointed when i get my score.
8.0	But after analysis my score distribution,i find out my weakness in English study.
8.0	I can do a more suitable plan for myself to prepare for the test.
8.0	I got pretty low score in listening and reading part,that tells me that i should take more time on those part.
5.0	Children is at their most developing period of their life.
8.0	They need to try different things among most of which is their first experience.
8.0	So the mistake is unavoidable.
8.0	Parents should not prevent their child from making miastake,for they can learn more from the mistake they made rather than the advice from their mom or dad.
8.0	With the uncertainty of our environment is increasing.
8.0	Parents have to practice the ability of their child of solving uncertain problems that exists among our life.
8.0	That is an extremely vital part of the process for a child grow into an adult.
2.0	The reasons can be explained more for mistakes just a neccessary part of life.
12.0	TherE is many different stand points regarding satisfication on the work ,some people belive that it will be better to work with different types of tasks to do during the work day,while other s hold the opposite ponit of view that to do same task make them to be happier.
11.0	In my opinion ,i disagree with this and there is several reasor to named.
5.0	Obviously ,many different type of work canbenificial for them to keep the motivation on job and easy to make them fell happy,most of the woker belive that they can not  endure the the boring mchanically work,however, many different type of work may causeing them felling more badly.
5.0	Different type of work wil always forceing the worker to face new challenges ,and spend more time to finish every kind of tasks,sooner,they will fell tired and quite stressful ,then theywill decrease the movitation until they give up this job.
10.0	this shows them unhappy wil doning repeting work will only make them boring,but not lose the motivation.
10.0	From what has been disgust above ,we can easily arrive the conclution that to doing the the similar tasksall day long will make worker fell happer than let them have plenty of different types of tasks to do during the workday.
3.0	In modern society, people always face the delimma to choose whether do similar jobs all day long or try many different types of tasks.
3.0	This problem is the much debated one in that it affects everyone in their daily lifes.
3.0	Some people argues that the fist statements is more satisfiing , while others agree more on the latter one.
11.0	From my perspective, I think the second one is better by all means.
5.0	It is convincing that people do same work everyday can master his jobs better, for he can do them orderly without unfamiliar or hesitate on his works.
8.0	So he's more effictive and specialize in his field for he spends much of his time on them.
8.0	For example, my math teacher is 40 years old now and he began his career since he was 22 years old.
8.0	He teaches same concepts for almost 20 years so there's no difficluties in his works and he can cope with all the things very well.
8.0	Everyone in our class loves him very much.
5.0	However, such jobs aren't satisfied enough for most of the people.
8.0	Choosing many different types of tasks can always give you more incentive and motivation to finish them.
8.0	Since you will work with many different people and learn many new things,it can give you a sense of achievement and higher quality of your working emotions.
8.0	For instance, my uncle is a business man who always need to contact with different people, ont only founders , elites and celebrities but also artists and some blue collar workers.
8.0	He always work with these people and do many different jobs, then he can get many background knowledge about different careers and social aspects.
8.0	Now he is a very successful business man and masters many skills he learned from others.
0.0	Likewise, having many different types of tasks can help to cultivate your independence and advance confidence to yourself.
0.0	As you work with many various types of things and try to managed them very well, it will encourage you to deal with other things you haven't tried yet.
0.0	When you success, you will get full of energy to finish your tasks, so you get job satisfaction and enjoy your work time.
0.0	Considering the situations that when you finished a hard work that you haven't contacted before.
0.0	How will your mates and boss treat you ?
0.0	They will see you a true man which is dare to challenge new things meanwhile you can get higher payroll for your brave challenge.
3.0	Nowadays, as the development of the world moving fast, more and more attention are put on the education.
12.0	All of the  parents hope their children can earn enough money and live a comfortable life.
12.0	In order to make children confident and achieve success in their early life, some parents offer them money for each high grade they get in school.
4.0	In my opinion, it's a good idea.
10.0	First of all, if children can earn money after they get good grades, they will be more positive, so they will put more attention to prepare the next exam to earn more money.
4.0	Besides, parents will bulid a value of earning money is not easy in their heart, so they believe that if you want to be rich enough, you should work harder than others.
8.0	For example, one of my brothers has a good family, both of his parents are leaders of their companies, but his parents never give him money without any reasons, they always tell him that they only give him money which are necessary, if he want to earn more money to buy something he likes, the only solution is earn money by himself.
8.0	When he was in the college, he found a part-time job to get money and studied hard to earn rhe scholarships, and finally he graduated, he found a good job in a big company without anyone's help.
8.0	So if you want to be more successful, you should earn money by your effort.
4.0	Last but not least, they will learn to how to save money and hw to put money to buy things that aren't wastefui.
10.0	Many students in the college don't konw haw to use their money in a good way, so there always are students who don't have money in the end of the term.
2.0	In conclusion, I think it's good to give children some money when they make a small success.
10.0	.
3.0	Should parents use money arouse kid's learning motivation?
12.0	In my opinion, offering kids money for each high grade(mark) they get in the school is certainly not a good idea.
3.0	Reasons are as follows.
11.0	Firstly, money's stimulus may lead a wrong way.
9.0	Some supporters may say that it can motivate kid's postivity of study.
3.0	But do these people consider this problem：do their kids indeed pay their efforts to get high grade, or just cheat?
9.0	Compared to use some gifts to fufill kids, leading kids to become interested in classes may be a better chocie.
6.0	Secondly, it may affect kids' value formatively.
8.0	When the grade has to do with money, it seems that the knowledge is combined with benefits.
8.0	Several years ago, a Chinese scientist cheated the world that he did certain reaserch sucessfully.
8.0	But nobody can restage his experiment.
8.0	Eventually it turned out that the scientist just cheated for benefits.
8.0	Benefits are important in our whole life, but there are still many things about virtues, values, which are supposed to be treasured by us.
8.0	So don't leave cool money to kids' good behavior.
8.0	You need to instrut them dreams ,efforts,beliefs and so on.
10.0	Thirdly,
3.0	As increasing number of up-to-date technologies advance into our society, it is a common fact that almost every family has television and we always can see some advertisment designed for children.
3.0	However, I undoubtedly am into the tune that we are supposed to stop this kind of advertising.
4.0	In the first place, some interesting advertising on television will bring nemerous negative impacts on children's physical healthy.
8.0	When my family watch television together, my little sister Jane always approchs to television can stire the cartoon advertisements such as two dancing bears on the screen; furthermore, she even searchs more this kind of cartoon advertisements about some cookies and clothes because she thinks they are too funny and vivid.
8.0	However, owing to the long term watching television for Jane and children's eyes do not grow mature yet, she, a only five years old girl, wears eye glasses, which will bring unbelievebal unconvenience for her.
8.0	Therefore, in order to protect children's physical healthy, we are supposed to stop these advertising toward young children.
4.0	Asiding from this negative impact, advertising directly toward children will hurt their psychological health as well.
8.0	My own experience never fail to illustrate this opinion.
8.0	I saw a threaten cartoon advertising which decribed a snack attacks a small boy in evening when I was five years old.
8.0	After that, I still fear of everything about night and I even fear to go to the polite alone nowadays.
8.0	That threaten cartoon advertising leave me an unremovable fear of night and my classmates always laugh me about this thing.
8.0	All of these add a uncolofur and unhappy memory in my childhood.
8.0	Therefore, in order to provide children a happy and psychological health living condition, we should interrupt these advertisements now.
4.0	Finally, because children who aged two to five do not obtain the mature cognitive ability, they are fail to distinguish which behavior is right and which behavior is wrong; therefore, they always blindly follow some wrong behavior.
8.0	It is a common phenomenon that we always learn news that children in kindergarten fight other children because they saw some charaters in cartoon advertising fight with each other and blindly follow them;additinal, some children aged two to five even steal money in order to imitating the behavior in advertising design for them.
8.0	Obviously, these advertising towar little children causes sumless bad effects on children and they may obtain lots of bad habits baside on these advertising.
8.0	Thus, we have to stop spread of these advertising.
2.0	To sum up, the advertising directed toward young chikdren are supposed to be interruped as soon as possible.
3.0	There are too many things to consider when choosing the way of helping friends in schooling work.
3.0	Different people have different opinions about how to help friends in a class.
3.0	As far as I am concerned, the way of that he finds a tutor is better than that I help individually my friend.
5.0	First, As for education, a tutor can help my friend in a more technical way so that my friend can benefit more from the tutor.
8.0	Because tutor is more professional than me in the aspect of how to teach somebody.
8.0	He can find quickly the weakness which my friend had in the class.
8.0	And the tutor has much experience and he can rapidly know my friend's ability in studying and my friend's character so the tutor can ues a more effective way to teach my friend.
8.0	For example, In high school, my math was pretty terrible, I was so depressed.
8.0	Unfortunately, although I had asked my friend who did well in math for help, my math is still so bad.
8.0	Afterwards, my mother got a tutor to help me study math.
8.0	He found my so many drawbacks and he gave me some efficient suggestions which help me a lot.
8.0	Finally  I made great progress in math, which make me so excited.
5.0	Due to the help offered by the tutor, I overcame the trouble in match.
8.0	I think he finds a tutor is a better way.
8.0	Second, althoug I am his friend, I don't have much time to help him solve the problem.
8.0	As a student, I have many school work to deal with everyday.
8.0	And after class I have to take part in the activity which is held by the association on campus.
8.0	And I have to do some chores to relieve my parent's pressure.
8.0	For instance, my brother ever told me that he had a misunderstanding with his friend in high school.
8.0	Because his friend asked him for help to improve his chemistry, but my brother rejected him because of private reason such as studying, which make his friends so annoyed.
8.0	Because he though my brother was so selfish.
8.0	Later, my brother found a tutor for him and the tutor helped him a lot, which made his friend understand my brother and made him so guilty and grateful to my brother.
8.0	So I think finding a tutor is a better way for my friend.
1.0	Juding from all the evidence offered, we may arrive safely at the conclusion that a tutor is more professional and I am busy doing my private things.
1.0	Therefore, finging a tutor for my friend is better than helping him by myself.
3.0	Many are concerned about children's  growth, and there is particular concern regarding educating children.
3.0	On the one hand, some people think that educating children is a more difficult task today than it was in the past.
11.0	On the other hand, people reckon that educating children is easier now than the past. n my opinion, I support the latter statement.
5.0	First of all, with the development of the technology, the educating methods are various.
10.0	For instance, teachers can use online course to attract children's interest, they also utilize the real time monitoring to oversee children learn conscientiously, so they don't need to worry about children playing computer games.
5.0	On the contrary, teachers only could hold books and sat in the classroom to teach children.
8.0	Second, children have a superior learning ability than the past.
8.0	They can accept new things swiftly.
8.0	For example, children's parents are all educated in the past, however, at the present, they can't adapt to the information era well.
8.0	Now, once there are something new, children can study without any difficulty.
8.0	Therefore, educating children is more simple.
10.0	Third, parents can use the
11.0	As far as I'm concerned, either way of relaxation is reasonble but under most circumstances, doing physical excise is more effective.
10.0	My reasons are listed as follows:
4.0	Initially, physical exercise works better for your health.
9.0	Spending a long period of time under the stressed-out situation often leads to human body's lack of oxygen, which will be largely eased by proper outdoor activities using strengh.
9.0	Once the habit of everyday exercise is formed, your not only consistently gain a sense of relaxation but also keep fit and stay away from occupational disease.
4.0	what's more, physical exercise encourages your to step out of your comfort zone and experience new things.
10.0	Unlike watching or reading that occures in a private and silent area, exercising is all about exploration, communication and coorperation.
4.0	Additionally, to get exercise is always easier than to read or watch films which has a strict limitation of time and the environment.
9.0	Exercise can be done whenever your like regardless of your location.
9.0	For example, if you are in a office or a classroom, all your need to do is to stand up and stretch your legs.
10.0	To sum up, physical exercise benefits one's in various ways both mentally and physically.
7.0	Therfore, never hesitate to turn your back to
3.0	Money, which you can buy any merchandise with, is the core motivation for an employee to work hard and actively.
3.0	Employers give a rise in employees' salaries either to incentive or to praise them for higher achievement which is always effective and efficient.
11.0	Employees become more productive and and earn more money, and the employers get more profits.
12.0	Whereas, students are not employees and they should not be treated in the same way as a employer do to the employee.
10.0	"Listed below are three reasons why I think ""giving money to school-age children for each high grade mark they get in school""."
6.0	First, mental traits of school-age children are not fully developped so they don't have the ability to tell the value of money and may make inappropriate use of money.
8.0	News keep emerging that pupils buy some weapons and roles in network games without telling their parents, which support the point that they don't have a clear awareness of how to spent money and its value.
8.0	Second, childrens are students whose main purpose is to learn knowledge at school.
8.0	They should be concentrated on their study, but money will deviate and distract them from study.
8.0	After receiving some money as a praise for high grade some students are no longer to achieve better scores, some of which even suffer a drop in the scores.
8.0	Third, giving money to school-age children help them develop a money-oriented perspective of value, informing them that they are learning to earn money instead of self-improvement.
8.0	They place money in front of intrinsic value and virtues.
8.0	After they grow up they only see money and care nothing else, which results in some of the bank robberies and other economic crimes.
2.0	In a word, I don't agree with the opinion of some parents to give money to their school-age children for high grade mark at school.
12.0	I think it is benefit for children to gain money that is given by parents for each high grade,those students who are in there school-age need financial help from others.
12.0	and if they don`t have fund from school.
9.0	parents give money to them is expressing exspcially significant care in their study situation.
9.0	so,I prefer to give students a encourgement by giving they money rathet than do not to show some prize to them.
6.0	Firstly,I insist that students has a daily expanse ,and give they some money as they have a high grade in school is a good way to stimulate their motivation when they get money.
8.0	To illustrate previously my friend is not good at doing math questions.
8.0	and he is not intersted in it,so every exams he only get few pionts.
8.0	but when someday he grade accidently rised was resulted by parents gave he some money during his grade is little better than he got ago.
8.0	so it is useful for parents offer their shool-age sthdents money for each high grade However giving childern money may let they too pride to have a impluse purchase by using their money which is get from their patents to have a entertainment time
11.0	In my oppinion, I think it is a great idea.
11.0	A good parents should help their children to do well in school.
11.0	But lots  of parents do not know what to do.
4.0	And the methode provide by the question is a great way to do that.
10.0	And I am going to discusses the reason of it.
4.0	The first reason is I think  money is a good way to motivate the school-age child to study, because most of them do not know why they are study  And if we give those child a reason to study.
8.0	Dosen't that will increase the interest of study?
8.0	when I was a child I was always mad about going to school to do those boring study, and I always thinking about  to have a lot of money.
8.0	As my mother awares of that she use this methode to help me increase the interest of study And I get good grades because of that.
4.0	Another reason of it is a great methode is , This is also a oppotunity to teach our child about everthing is gaining by hard work.
8.0	Lots of parents will satisfiy our children's want without conditions.
8.0	Which is wrong to do that because it will give your children a sence that ' Ask my mother when I need everythings ' .
8.0	We need to let them know ' if you want something you gotta work gor it ' .
8.0	By giving them money when they get good greades.
8.0	This is the best methode to teach them that.
8.0	Because my mother use this way to teach me about gain by hard work.
8.0	I never have the thought that every things I want will fall from the sky.
8.0	I gatta earn it !
8.0	This is one thing that I will thank my mom for entire life.
2.0	And this is all the reason that why I think give school age child money when they have good greades its a good idea.
3.0	Currently, a controversial topic is heated debates among public: are young people toady are more likely to invest their time and efforts in improving the world than young people in the past.
3.0	Opinions vary from person to person.
12.0	Some claim that young people in the past are more likely to spend their time and efforts in improving the world.
12.0	However, i hold an opposite view.
11.0	My point can be elaborate as follows.
5.0	First, as economy develops, young peolpe consider less on their diet, which may lead them invest more in improving the world.
8.0	It is all known that if someone is struggling with the starve and thiristy, he may not able to pay much attentino on improving the world.
8.0	Only if people live comforable, they will try to achieve other goals such as improving the world.
8.0	My grandfather, who is severty years old, said to me that there were mere food to ear when he was twenty years old.
8.0	Everyday he had to think how can he do to get a cup of water or a piece of bread.
8.0	After the hard period, he became a teacher in high school and he could eat fruits and meats everyday.
8.0	In his days of teaching, he told me that he considered that he should make his efforts to teach his students which may improve that world.
8.0	So, young people today have enough food to eat and they are more likely to invest their time and efforts in improving the world.
5.0	Second, with the development of internet, young people nowadays can easily get some information about different kinds of need around the wourld, which is beneficial for them in thinking what they can do to improve the world.
8.0	You can easily learn about that people need more healthy food to eat and more exercising equipments to use.
8.0	It is common to see that many young students is making efforts to create more healthy food or try their best to collect money to build some equipment for public.
8.0	My classmates, who uses the mobile phone everyday and gets infromation about healthy food requirement everyday, just build a company to offer healthy food to people.
8.0	He think that is it his duty to do so.
2.0	In sumary, from what have discussed above, we can safely get the conclusion that young people today are more likely to invest their time and efforts improving the world than young people in the past.
11.0	I partly agree with the following statement.
12.0	I think for success in a future job, the ability to relate well with people and studying hard at school should combine to achieve success in a future job.
4.0	The ability to cope with people and relationship is quite necessary because usually a nerd or a bad-tempered person will find it hard to be liked and therefore people will not like you as much.
8.0	To work, everybody need to cooperate with others so a person lack of communication and undertanding for others will fail to get a pleasant result.
8.0	From this point of view, good relationship will help to be a better worker.
8.0	Also, if people around you don't like you, you will loose a lot of chances.
8.0	For example, promotion.
8.0	To select one from two people with the same acedemic achievement, empression is the key.
8.0	With better communiction skills, a person will be more easily spotted and liked by others.
8.0	Even if the two people have slightly different acedemic skills, the person with a better relationship will definitely stand out.
4.0	Studying hard at school is important, though from a different perspective.
8.0	A person with a better education lever can get more chances and more choices from the beginning.
8.0	Acdemic knowledge is the basic need of all other factors, and this element is competive when there is a certain standard.
8.0	Also, a person with a better grade at school will sound more reliable and this kind of person will be a better choice for employees.
4.0	With the two combined, a person can prove how good he or she is by direct acedemic levels, and also by gaining the love of other people.
9.0	This is more competitive nowadays, in a world full of competitions and talented people.
9.0	Although speciall cases - such as a nerd become the top scientist, or a person with little education get a lot of money, are everywhere around us; we shouldn't forget what the most direct and normal way is.
1.0	Also note that the ability to relate well with people has no direct connection with being a good student at school.
1.0	School is a place for us to study as hard as we can, and the world is the place to learn about social skills.
3.0	With the development of the society, many people have the worry about the young generation.
11.0	Recently, someone indicates that with the complex modern life, it is essential for young people to have the ability to plan and organize.
12.0	If you ask me, my answer is yes.
11.0	People with the ability of planning and organizing will live better and have more competitive power.
4.0	To begin with, the ability of organizing is vital to modern life.
8.0	Stronger ability of organizing means more outcome and more scores.
8.0	People in modern life must have their work and study done in a very limited time.
8.0	It is of importance to make your own schedule about your work and study.
8.0	What is an emergent one and what can be put off?
8.0	A great schedule help people do things more efficiently.
4.0	Furthermore, making plan helps young people focus on the things they really want to do.
9.0	Young people, especially students, they have the most precious time in their life in the campus but most of them don't know how to plan their study life in the campus, which is really a pity.
9.0	If they plan their life in the campus, they will confim their majors and directions much earlier, which help them deepen their interest in this major, resulting in the broaden of the horizons in their early life.
4.0	In addition, people with an arrangement will never be panicky because they know what to do and when to do.
9.0	In spite of the emergency, beneath the great habit of making a schedule, they will calmly cogitate and come up with a solution eventually.
9.0	What's more, owing this ability and habit of planning, the people will be more steady and more mature than they are, which gives other people a feeling of security and leaves others a great impression on your stable personality.
1.0	To sum it, there is no doubt that young people ought to develop and cultivate their ability of planning and organizing.
1.0	Young people may not adapt to the way of thinking previously in the beginning, but they will benefit from the planning and organizing and will prodoundly appreciate what they did for the future of them.
3.0	Nowaday, there is a interesting debate between parents.
3.0	Should parents offer their school-age children money when they get good grade in school?
3.0	Some of the parents agree with it and their kids of course like it.
3.0	Others strongly disagree with this statement for some reasons.
3.0	From my point of view, I one hundred percent disagree with giving money to the kids when they get good grade.
11.0	The reason why do I think so are kids should study for theirself but not for  the money and  it is not good for building their characteristics.
5.0	Firstly, parents should tell their kids that study is for yourself not for parents.
8.0	What you get and learn from school will help you in the future.
8.0	They are much worthy than money.
8.0	Most of the kids they don't know much about the right or wrong when they have problem, they need their parents set a good model for them.
8.0	If parents keep giving them money, they will think it's a right thing and they deserve to get money.
8.0	Especially when they get money when they do something good, it is not a good thing for both parents and kids.
8.0	Kids will lose their interests of doing everything.
8.0	Maybe for them, the only purpose is to get money from their parents.
8.0	They study for money, eat on time for money and also do exersice for money.
8.0	That's way we should let kids know they should studyd for theirselves but not for the money.
5.0	Secondly, we should build kid's characteristics in a right way.
8.0	In another hand, kids like to be praised.
8.0	What we should do is to develop their hobbies.
8.0	For example, If a kid likes to play basketball, I would like to suggest to buy him or her a pair of basketball shoes.
8.0	If a kid like to take pictures, maybe I will consider about buying him or her a cameral.
8.0	Something like this is better than just giving them money.
8.0	The parents should always tell their kids a concept: Although we can do a lot of things when we have money but money is not the most important thing in our life.
8.0	The most important thing is to be happy every day and have many hobbies.
8.0	So building characteristices is important.
1.0	To give a conclusion, I don't think it's a good idea to give kids money when they get good grade in school because if you do so, they won't study for theirselves, they study for money.
1.0	Also, it's not good for building their characteristics when parents keep giving kids money when they get good grade.
7.0	I suggest that parents should spend more time with kids
3.0	Recently，many parents choose to offer some money if their children get a high grade in their school.
3.0	it is a great way for parents to encourage their kid to get higher grade.
11.0	I support it is a good idea.
4.0	some person maybe think that kids would be concerned on money rather than learn more knowledge.
10.0	Due to their this idea，they may get more great grade，But they will lose their goal to study.
4.0	However，on the other hand，this action will imporve kid's interesing in study.
9.0	If their children haven't movement on studying，they must haven't good grade.
9.0	Because of this good idea， they will  have a goal to support them continue.
4.0	This is a first step to atttain high make.
8.0	In addition， kids can learn the knowledge ：no pains，no gains.
8.0	It is important for childs to grow up.
8.0	Moreover，kid can learn how to cost the money that they get through their hard.
8.0	Money is a thing they must learning to use in the futher，so parents should teach they to use  it as soon as possible.
7.0	I'm totally against the statement.
7.0	l think TV advertisement aiming on children aged from two to five must be prevented.
4.0	First, children on that stage have not formed ample notion.
8.0	They can not tell right from wrong, so the advertisement on TV may lead them tosomething wrong.
8.0	Once things like that happens, the results can't be imagined.
8.0	Maybe the future of a child will be ruined just beacuse the wrong notion that he formed when he was a three years old,and it can be very hard to correct when he grew up.
8.0	How disappointed will that be.
8.0	Children is the future of a country or a nationality.
8.0	They should not be advertised until they have the ablity to tell right from wrong.
4.0	Besides, children still have many other things to do, for example they need to develop their interests to develop so that they can face what they will meet in the future, but not just wasting time before TV, watching the advertisements that are delivered to them.
9.0	They can't be influenced by TV advertisement.
9.0	They deserve to have a better childhood without advertisements.
4.0	Lastly, children aged two to five are too small, and their eyes do not develop completely.
7.0	Watching TV may do great harm to their eyes, which has a bad effect when they gro
3.0	As the generation of the internet is comeing, advertising have became the main way for corporations to improve their popularity.
3.0	Without the TV advertising, customer cannot gain the improtant informaton of the product.
3.0	Similarly, from my pespective, TV advertising which derected toward young children should be allowed   as it can benifit a lot.
5.0	To begin with, without the advertisment toward young children, it's hard for infant's product companys to  increace their product's publicity.
9.0	In fact, the advertisment can create a lot of profit for companys.
9.0	For example, a company which cannot said
5.0	On the top of that, adveritising toward young children can stimulate the development of the young children's innovation.
10.0	As a metter of fact, infant advertising always involved with some colorful image and some creative story.
7.0	For instance, some candy afvertising always use same cartoo
3.0	With the world changing so rapidly, some thinks that people are less happy with their lives than people were in the past.
11.0	Personally, I disagree with this idea.
11.0	In contrast, I think the oppoiste is true --- people are more happy with their lives that people were in the past.
4.0	First, people are more satisfied because they can keep in touch with their friends and families easily whenever and wherever they are, thanks to our advanced technology.
8.0	In the past, people suffered from home-sickness, when they were away from home.
8.0	It was hard for them to get in touch with far-away friends or families.
8.0	Nowadays, we can enjoy keeping touch with our families and friends regardless of the distance between us.
8.0	Take me for instance.
8.0	I study in Hubei province, which is quite far from my hometown.
8.0	Everytime I miss my family or my old friends, I would call them, or talk to them face to face with the aid of Wechat or Facebook.
8.0	I cannot imagine what if I cannot talk to them a whole month as our ancestors did.
8.0	I may be sick due to missing my family.
8.0	Thus, I think people are more happy because they can get close to their family with the help of phones or internet.
4.0	Second, people are more happy because they can enjoy enormous materies, without need to worry about lacking of food, etc.
8.0	It is common to see the bright smiles when people buy their favourite food or clothes.
8.0	Lots of people, in the past, died of starvation, which sounds scary to most of us who have overwhelming food.
8.0	My grandma told me she had four brothers, one of who died of starvation in World War II.
8.0	I know this is really painful for her.
8.0	This terrible thing is so far away from most of us.
8.0	We are happier without worrying about food which may take our life or our families away.
4.0	Third, people are more satisfied because they have access to much more entertainments.
8.0	In the past, there are few entertainments available for people.
8.0	They have to go to bed early without of light.
8.0	Now, we have more fantastic night life.
8.0	We also have fun due to our advanced technology, such as computer games, electric novels, etc.
7.0	All in all, I think that people are more happy with their lives that people were in the past, with access to connect with friends or families, sufficient materir
3.0	More and more parents worry about their children's grade.
3.0	To encouage their children to hardworking, some parent will offer their children money for each high grade they get in school.
12.0	Although some people think study is students' primary task so good mark needn't be rewarded, I think offer money is a good way to motivate children to study well.
4.0	First of all, in that way children will benefit from their good grade in a material way.
8.0	Now lots of parents just praise their children when they get good mark or just think their children should have the good mark.
8.0	If their children fail in the exam, they will beat them or criticize them seriously.
8.0	Therefore, the children will feel lots of pressure during the exam because they are afraid of having a bad grade.
8.0	They study because of fearness.
8.0	On contrary, if the children can get some money because of their mark, they will have a disire to hardworking in order to acquire the money.
8.0	These children study because of encouragement.
8.0	The later absolutely have more power in studying than the former.
4.0	Secondly, offering children money could let them have a ability to manage their money.
8.0	Children can use these money to buy anying they want such as toys, a basketball or some vidio tapes.
8.0	When children get these money, they would not permit to ask extra money for entertainment so  they could form a habit to save money.
8.0	To get the money, children will study hard.
8.0	In that way children will have a useful ability and a good grade.
4.0	Lastly, there are lots of ways to improve children's mark just like a tutor or buy some test books.
7.0	However, I think offer money is the most useful and effective way to help the children have a good mark,
3.0	Many people would say that awarding young kids for their good grades is a bad idea because they may abuse the money with unproper uses.
11.0	I agree that it's no good to give kids too much money.
12.0	After all, I've seen teenagers buying cigarettes and alcohol with their money.
12.0	However, I do think parents can praise they kids with proper amount of money for their grades.
4.0	For starters, some proper money can surely evokes kids' interests for study.
8.0	When we were kids, we always want some more money because it meant more snacks and more toys.
8.0	So kids may try some ways to earn some money by doing housework or part-time jobs.
8.0	Therefore, if parents tell them to perform well in the school by which they can earn some money, kids will be pleased to do the job.
8.0	For example, my parents once encouraged me to get a 100 points in th final math exams.
8.0	And if I did that, they would praise me with 100 yuan which is a relatively great amount of money.
8.0	Thus, i just tried my best to study math and finally I got 100 points in the final math exam.
8.0	Since then I have been fell in love with math which is still one of my favorite and best subjects.
8.0	We can see that a proper encouragement with some money do increase kids' interests for study.
4.0	What's more, if parents offer the kids some money to allocate for their grades, kids will learn how to manage their money at a young age.
8.0	We can see that when kids have money they usually don't konw what to do besides playing and eating snacks.
8.0	We can tell them to spend the money on different kind of purpises such as charity, buying books, and just saving them.
8.0	These kinds of money managements are essential for kids' future.
8.0	One day they have to manage their own money.
8.0	How can we teach them not to abuse the money and use it properly.
8.0	If we offer them some money to spend, they may control their money better in the future.
8.0	For example, Li Jiachen, one of the richest men in China, gives his sons some money when they perform well in school and teaches them how to manage them because he is a successful businessman himself.
8.0	When his sons grow up, they are both good businessman nowadays.
4.0	Admittedly, it's true that when kids have money they may use the money to do some wrong things, which is harmful for their entire life.
8.0	But it will be alright if we just offer them some small amount of money so that they cannot do anything bad for themselves.
8.0	On the other hand, we should also tell them to use the money, which is a part of parents' resbonsibility.
8.0	Therefore, when they have enough money even to do some bad things, they will know whether they should do the things.
8.0	Parents have the chance to teach them.
2.0	To sum up, whearas there is an arguement  taht kids shouldn't be given money for good grades, namely the fact that they may abuse themoney, evoking kids interest for study, coupled with money management makes a storng case that kids should be rewarded with some proper amount of money when they get good grades in their schools.
3.0	Nowadays, many people will  make mistakes and they think that it is a normal.
12.0	Including kids,they make mistakes is normal phenomeno.
11.0	Nevertheless many parents thinks that kids can not make mistakes., because they can avoid making mistakes.
12.0	It is contorvercial issue that parents should accept their kids mistakes and teache them learn from it.
12.0	Pesonally speaking,I believed that Making mistakes is very normal and it plays a crucial role in students life.
11.0	I have several reasons in the following paragraphs.
5.0	To start with,we can gain much experience from making mistakes.
8.0	To make specify,mistakes can teach us many useful manage.
8.0	For example, I have a friend named Amy.
8.0	She is a very out-understanding girl in our class.
8.0	One day,she got bad grades because she stayed up late for reviewing tomorrow test.
8.0	In order to get excellent grades and rank, she worked and reviewed assignment until the midnight,so tomorrow she sleeped in the test.
8.0	Finally she got bad grades and cried.
8.0	I told her that we should not be nervous and only she was hard-working  everyday so she did not worried about her grades,and she understood study means.
8.0	In the next test she got the best grades and we congratulate her.
8.0	In other words.
8.0	we can learn many know-how from mistakes.
5.0	Secondly,we can achieve our goal easily.
8.0	every person are not perfect and they can not avoid making mistakes.
8.0	According to a acdamic survey indicates that many sucesseful person make very seirous problem in their childhood.
8.0	For example , the establishment people of XingDongfang,YUMinghong,his english grade was very low and bad and he did not know many  english methods to study and he was not willing to study english.
8.0	Finally he got bad grades in the finished test and he could not get chance to attend university.
8.0	Neverthless,he learn many english methods from this misktakes,and he was working hard.
8.0	Then he achieve his goal.
0.0	Adimittedly,making mistakes can have negative impact on our life,but  its merits outweigh its disadvantages.
0.0	In conclusion,making mistakes is good way to achieve our goal and we can abtain experience from it.
0.0	so parents should allow their kids to make mistakes and learn from it.
3.0	As the generation of the inernet is coming, advertising has become the may choice for corporations to said their product and improve their pupularity.
3.0	Without the TV advertising, custmers will be difficult to gain the information of the product they want.
3.0	As a metter of fact, advertising in the TV turely attracts lots of custmer for it exhibit the function of the product vividly and remarkablely.
3.0	However, from my pespective, TV advertising toward young children should be limited.
11.0	And I have various resons to support my opinion.
6.0	To begin with, young children are lack of ability of recognize the thing is god or not, so they may attrct be some product which may cause a bad influnce toward those children.
8.0	In fact, most of the advertising toward young children are colorful and interesting.
8.0	So it's easily for kids to buy the product which in the advertising.
8.0	For instance, some candy advertising alwasys use some cartoon characters to make up a story about the candy.
8.0	Then, children will full in love with the story and they will willing to buy the product.
8.0	However, the candy can cause a damage to kid's teeth and make kids feel injury.
8.0	In brief, those advertising may make kid easily full in love with the porduct which can make a bad influence to baby's health condition.
0.0	On the top of that, young children will isolate from others since they always watching TV and find some cartoon Advertising.
0.0	From the report of science reserch, most of the baby who love watching tv are hardily to make friends with others.
0.0	Also, long time watching can damage kid's eyesight.
0.0	Kids should put most of their time in playing and communicating with others.
7.0	If they are involved in the TV advertising, they will feel boring about m
12.0	the topic point put an idea that workers can feel more satisfaction from different kinds of assinments than repeating sigularly one tasks during their work time.
11.0	I agree with this oppion to some extend.
5.0	for most people, different tasks can bring them more fun and more interest.
8.0	as we all know, it is difficult for people concentrate on one single thing for several hours let alone all day lone.
8.0	so it is a good way to let people alter their work contents.
8.0	in this way, not only can strengthen their focus but also canimprove their work efficiency.
8.0	besides, doing various tasks can make wokers learn more things. a lot of people want learn new things and new knowledge from a job, so if a company can arrange different tasks for their workers, their woker can gain more sense of success from this job.
5.0	however, altering work contents does not suit all people.
8.0	some people think that focusing on one singular task can make the work easier in that everyone has his own profession and talents.
8.0	only we make full use of these specalty , we can improve the work efficiency instead of wasting resourses.
8.0	what's more, not all people have enough ability to learn new things and completely handle with different types of assignments.
8.0	furthermore, making everyone do several types of tasks will increase the cost of company because they need spend time training workers time by time, which is quite a waste of resources.
0.0	as far as I am concerned, it is up to a job's needs.
0.0	if a job in some specific area like astronomy, it is not a good way to arrange different tasks for them to do because the work requires high professional skills and intense concentration.
0.0	in the other hand, jobs like assistants can add various tasks for them , owing to the boredom this job.
0.0	all in all, the best choice is a company should arrange suitable work content in coordience with the job requirements and the merits of a person.
3.0	Offering money for school-age children is always a debateble question.
3.0	From my perspective, giving money for small children outweighs its disadvantages.
11.0	First, apporiate amount of money gives children the incentive to study better.
12.0	It is widely acknowleded that study is the most significant stuff for students and if giving money can help them do better, why not?
8.0	If children receive money from their parents, they will learn they must try their best all the time in order to get encourgment.
8.0	Take my sister for example, her parents promised her a little sum of money for her high grades.
8.0	Since then my sister spared no effort on her homework, she even bought extra books and studied till late in order to obtain good marks.
5.0	Furthermore, giving them money can teach them that 'no pains, no gains', and hence let then develop a good habit when they are young.
8.0	We all know that success comes with sweat and hard work, and no one can get a satified refult easily.
8.0	If parents are willing to pay money for children's effort, they will work harder definitly.
8.0	For example, my brother always gets good grades at school.
8.0	when I asked him the reason, he told me it was the money that motivated him to move toward.
5.0	Lastly, offering money for children can make them adapt to the society.
8.0	We have to leave our parents and we have to confront the society by ourselves sooner or later.
8.0	Giving money to little child let he learn that only your work is useful can you get your payback.
8.0	My friend Mary got money from her parents at a very young age.
8.0	Later, when she works in a company, she is more competitive compared to her collages because she has less mistakes and less time for the same work which is owing to her parents behavior.
2.0	All things concerned, offering school-age children money for good marks is a good idea,for the intention to do better, the principle they learn, and quicker adaption to the society.
11.0	I agree with the statement that the question makes which is that because people are buusy doing so many different things, they do very few things well.
11.0	My reasons are on the below.
4.0	First, there was a story that which is about a monkey.
8.0	The story is.
8.0	Oneday, the monkey wants to get the peaches on the tree.
8.0	When he climbs onto the tree and get the peaches quickly, he sees some corns are on the ground, then he throw the peaches and then get the corns.
8.0	Suddenly, he sees another something good.
8.0	The thing is some peanuts.
8.0	Then the monkey throw the corns out and picks up the peanuts.
8.0	But unfortunatelly, he sees one watermelon, and he throw the peanuts out and runs quickly to pick up the watermelon.
8.0	He pick up the watermelon successfully and then hold the watermelon to go to the home.
8.0	However, the monkey drop the watermelon suddenly on a lane and the watermelon rolls too quickly for the monkey to catch.
8.0	This story tell us that if we do many thing in one time, then you won't do anything well.
4.0	Second, if you are studying on one subject directly, but the teachers says that you havce to finish these works in one time, I think you couldn't don any work succefully.
9.0	It sounds like if you wants to get the fish but you go to catch the butterfly, but you couldn't get any fish and catch the butterfly.
9.0	For example, there was a professor who wants to get many awards at one time, so he learns physics, geology, chemistry and archeology, but at the end, he couldn't get any awards, and the things he has learned he couldn't remember anything.
4.0	Third , if you study on one thing, you could do it well.
8.0	There was a famous ancient Chinese writer who is named Li Bai.
8.0	One day, he goes out for traveling and he travels to a small villiage, and he met a old woman who is making a thin iron stick by rolling one very big iron sticks on a stone.
8.0	"He is so puzzled that ask the old woman why she do this, the old woman says:"" If you have enough time, even a big iron stick could rolls into a thin iron stick."""
8.0	The story tell us, if you want to get successful on one thing , you couldn't average your mind on other things.
2.0	So that's why I agree with the statement that the question makes.
11.0	I agree with the following statement.
11.0	Because more and more people think these struggling strangers are great.
12.0	And people are kindness and helpfull.
12.0	If these struggling strangers need help ,people are willing to help for no reson.
6.0	Ma Yun is a not smart but very hard person.
8.0	He is very struggling.
8.0	He took three exam for graduating.
8.0	And his math more and more higher.
8.0	When he graduated from the college,he wanted to creat.
8.0	But it's very difficult .
8.0	Not only that ,he was very upset.
8.0	But some people will help him and give him some advices.
8.0	Finally,he created A LI BA BA and TAo Bao.
1.0	People are helpful and hope that struggling people will do best.
1.0	No what matter,they always help these strangers do themself best.
3.0	Recently, a controversial problem arouses people's debate: in parents' busy life, if they have time, whether they should spend family time in having fun such as playing games ,sporting or doing thing together related to children's school work.
3.0	Some people make think accompany with children in studying is more helpful for their children.
3.0	However, I believe that parents should play with their child in their spare time.
11.0	My view can be illustrated as follows.
5.0	To begin with, it is good for parents and children get close relationship.
8.0	Because if children play with their parents, they can experience same emotion at the same time together so that they can understand more about what you are considering.
8.0	Furthermore, they can easily express themselves when playing, thus parents and children can communicate well.
8.0	In this way, their relationship can be enhanced.
8.0	On the contrary, if parents doing things related to children's school work, they may feel uncomfortable because they need study five days in a week, if  their relax time with parents will be occupied by things related to school work, they may feel boring.
8.0	My brother John is a good case.
8.0	John usually played basketball with his father, so when they won the conpetition or lost the game, they would share the same feeling.
8.0	This time, his father would make deep talking with him, they both enjoy the moment of talking.
8.0	Therefore, their relationship was strengthened.
5.0	Beside, it is less time-consuming and energy consuming for parents to play with their children.
9.0	Because parents just need to ask their children to play games with them anytime they want.
9.0	Busy parents actually have few time to accompany with their children, if they need to prepare an activity that related to children's school work, they will have less time to play.
0.0	Finally, parents may give children wrong hint about school work if they do something related school work with thier child.
0.0	With the development of society, the education methods and sequense have been changed a lot.
0.0	So if parents do works related to the children's school work, they may want to impart some new knowledge to their child, but with the current teaching system, parents cannot sure whether is the best time, best way to tell the information to their children.
0.0	It is possible for parents make the children misunderstand some knowledge.
0.0	On the other hand, if parents play with children, they need not to consider about that.
3.0	Following the the development of technology, the world is totally change in several decades.
11.0	Some people says that grandparents can still give useful advice to their children because they are experienced.
11.0	However, I have a different idea, When it comes to a statement that the old can not give helpful suggestion to the young, I strongly agree with.
5.0	The life style is totally different from it during the old times.
8.0	Most of the old people will also remain their invalid behaviors.
8.0	For example, in the past, people's cognition of garbage classification is not as strong as today.
8.0	People always pack all rubbish together no matter what kind of rubbish is, which seem to be convenient.
8.0	This is a waste of rubbishes, because some rubbish such as can and the food is recyclable, which can be used to prouduce metal materials and fertilizers.
8.0	Nowadays most of city have classify trashbins.
8.0	Residents have to pack trash into different bags.
8.0	However, many olders are become stubborn, who do not realize the importance of rubbish classification , they will still put rubbish into one bag.
8.0	For example, there was a time I stay with my grandma.
8.0	After the dinner we were going to clean the room.
8.0	I put rubbish into different bags according to their properties.
8.0	However, when my grandma saw them, she criticed me.
8.0	She thought this is a waste of rubbish bags, all the rubbish can put in to a bag.
8.0	Although I tried to pursuade her to realize the sinificent of protect the environment, she still believed that this behavior is validable, because she did the same in her childhood.
8.0	Thus, the suggestions the older can give childern are limitied, because their characterize exhibit them to adopt new lifestyle.
5.0	Although the olders are skillful, they may give some useful advice to help childern shape their mold, the parents can still do the same.
10.0	Parents' advices are more helpful because they have faced many problem the old may not face in the past time such as find jobs.
7.0	To sum up, according to the new life style, I totally agree with thr idea that the old can not give advices tote
3.0	The significance of young people's decisions to futurecan never be overemphasized because it is closely related to social as a whole's future.
3.0	Recently, there have been a lot of controversies about whether new generation should or not have infuluence on the important decisions that determing the future.
3.0	Towards such a long-running rug of war, I am inclined to argue that I disagree with this statement.
11.0	And i also have many examples and reasons to illustrate my point of view.
5.0	First of all, the boy is strong and the country is strong.
8.0	There is no doubt that new genereation play a essential role in the future of society as a whole.
8.0	If the young people know their important decisions can help this society and control the future of society, they will know what should they do and having many good decision to improve this society.
8.0	In contrast, the young people have no influence on the significance decisions, they will not useful to this society.
8.0	Because this generation cannot do any useful decision to improve this society and only the older develop the country.
8.0	Consequently, this country will deteriore by themself.
5.0	In addition, developing of society and many family have more resource to children, and young people can have more decisions to choice.
8.0	As we all know, today many young people want to studing in other country, and they can study more advantages that their country have not.
8.0	Therefore, this is a important decision that determine the future of society as a whole.
8.0	Take me as an example, when i finishe the middle school final exam, I have two option to choose, studying in local or studying to the other country.
8.0	And I choose the second choice.
8.0	I think this decision is important to me and this society's future.
8.0	Because if i get good grades in other country's school, I can get more and more knowledge that our country have not, and taking back it to develop this society.
7.0	Taking all the factors  above into account, an unshakable conclusion can be drawn that young people today have influence on deci
3.0	mark is money?
3.0	In today's century,more and more career  look high of employee's high education.
11.0	So most of parents want their children study more skiils and get more knowledge.
11.0	They even come out many ways to make their children study hard.
12.0	One of them is offer their children money for each high grade they get in school.
11.0	Then l think although it is a little realistic,it can be a good way to make children study hard.
5.0	The reason why l say so is that as the chlidren grow up,they may not have power to study,so first of all,parent sffer their children money for each high grade they get give them power to study,this of course can make the children study hard.
9.0	Secondly,give their children money by this way can make children konw earn money is difficult,can make them take less waste of money.
9.0	Last but not least,children can not get money if they can not get high grade,so this also can tell them a law:you can not stop doing a thing when you feel dislike it,sometimes.
5.0	A simple example,l have low grade in many exams,and than l wanted to gave up,because whichever l use way to study,l can not get my grade higher.
9.0	Then my parents told me they would offer money if l could get hjgh grade.
9.0	So in a matter of fact,l had the motivate of study,this could help me study hard,and for the goal,l would get more konledge,get more relationships with classmates and teachers.
2.0	So in a clude,l think offer their children money for each high grade is a good way to motivate thier children to study,br the way,they can get more relationships,konwledge and happiness,it is really a good idea l think.
3.0	As far as iam concerned,I think it not is a good idea tooffer children money for their grade.
11.0	In order to help children to make greater progress in their study ,parents should gradually give up this way.
5.0	From a short term angle,children seem to behave better in their study and get a higher grade ,but studying is not just test and high grades.
8.0	Giving money as prize create a link between high grades and rewards  ,which make children study for grades and money ,but not improving themselves.
8.0	Studying will be treated as a mission for money they can get but not a stair for better life,job ,wedding and future.
8.0	Once parents stop this,children will lose their energy of studying.
8.0	So this way is not a good solution to solve the problem,and it might make the problem even worse.
5.0	From a long term angle,I  believe that parents do this for the sake of helping children to create interest or even fall in love with studying.
9.0	As the old saying goes,keep learning until you die.
9.0	They want their children to keep improving themselves to live a better life and overcome the challenges of society.
3.0	Relaxing physically or mentally    In today's society, fierce competition and pressure from life can make people feel tired and stressful.
3.0	So relaxing in our free time seems to have great significance to us.
11.0	From my perspective,I agree with the statement that it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.
11.0	In the following part,I will give reasons from three aspects to support my view.
4.0	First, I want to talk about the convenience of relaxing by reading and watching a movie that doing physical exercise doesn't have.
8.0	As is known to all, we can read a book or watch a moive at any places and at any time.
8.0	That means, we can relax in our home,on the way to home or in our working places.
8.0	Also we can relax by doing so before sleep,during the break between work or the weekend and holiday.
8.0	But doing physical exercise needs enough time,such as 30 minutes or more, and it asks for suitable places,suitable clothes,suitable boby state and so on.
8.0	So we can't relax through this whenever and wherever we want.
8.0	In the contrast, relaxing mentally can be easily available to us.
4.0	Secondly,I want to mention the possible harm that doing physical exercise have but reading and so on doesn't.
8.0	Obviously,doing physical exercise needs guidance and carefulness.
8.0	If we are not familiar with the sports or if we are not aware that our body may not be suitable to doing this or that,it may be dangerous for our body and healthy.
8.0	And after exercising,we should have long time to calm down,so we can continue our job.
8.0	It takes too much time and wastes our energy.
8.0	But reading a book or watching a movie can easily begin and easily finish,so we can go oo our job quickly.
8.0	And mentally relaxing cannot do any harm to our body.
4.0	Last but not least,I want to talk about the benefits of relaxing mentally that doing physical exercises doesn't have.
8.0	By watching a movie or reading a book,we can not only relax our mind and body,but also we can gain knowledge from those things.
8.0	We can broaden our horizons and have a better understanding or our world, our life and ourselves.
8.0	It can make us think about things in different ways.
8.0	It can be helpful for our future work and life.
1.0	In a word, I believe that relaxing by watching a movie or reasing a book is better than doing physical exercise.
1.0	In our everyday life,we should be based on the mental relax,and when needed,doing some suitable physical exercise .
3.0	Last week, I walked by a classroom, and I saw many students will be pararised by their good behavior in the studying, and all of them are awarded by a great momunt of scholarship.
3.0	And seeing this, I think that I need to study hader to become as good as them to get some scholarship for myself, which is agreat honor.
3.0	Besides, the scholarship just like the money that parents give their children for their good grades?
12.0	So I think parents ooffer their children money for great mark is something good.
5.0	First, this can make the childre realize the concept that studying is beneficial for them, so that they will spend more time on studying.
9.0	When I was just a small child, my parents make a plan for me, which goes like this, the more time I spend on studying, the more award I can get, including getting huge mark.
9.0	On this condition, my life was filled with studying, I did not waste any time on other meaningless things such as playing video games, and this make me become more mature, because knowledge make me understand more things.
5.0	Secondary, the circumantance is just like we are doing a job in our society.
8.0	Because of your efforts put into working, the boss will give you more salary.
8.0	And what the statement is just like this.
8.0	The parents have the responsibility to make their children understand No pain, No gain, which will do a lot of favour when they go to work in the future.
8.0	So example, I had a friend inthe past, and sometimes he would complain the plan to me.
8.0	If he wanted to get money, it wuld take him lots of time to study, and he was always tired because of working.
8.0	But at the moment that he got the money, he couldn't stop feeling happy from the bottom of his heart.
8.0	After that, he told me the time that we spent will become a return for us in another way.
1.0	Lastly, some people think this plan will let children waste money because of they cannot spend the money in a wise way.
1.0	But this is also a very good way to teach them how to spend their money in a better way.
7.0	The mother of
12.0	Nowadays, many people tend to know events happening around the world even if they relate less to them.
12.0	They assert that knowing more can not noly boarden horizon, but also bond themselves more tightly to the society.
11.0	However, I contend it is not so important to know these events.
5.0	First, to follow the fast pace of the society, people should focus on their own thing.
8.0	Being busy with their work, people are supposed not to let their attenion be distracted.
8.0	A lot of time will be wasted if they pay attention on other things.
8.0	An it is possible that people cannot finish their work because of caring for others, which is not a sensible decision.
8.0	For example, my sister cared a lot about the air crash in Malaysia which is far away from her in China.
8.0	She focused on it every moment and she even did not do her homework.
8.0	Thought about this in class, none can be listened or absorbed by her.
8.0	Finally, she got poor grades in her final exam.
8.0	It is really not important for people to know about things happen away from them.
5.0	Furthermore, people contribute little to the events they know.
8.0	Even if they know the problems, they have no idea to solve them.
8.0	They cannot help the people involved in the accidents.
8.0	Only if they are involved in can they have the right to give advice.
8.0	And hinking about the unsolved problem, peoples own life w
1.0	Although people can broaden their eyesight if knowing the events, the information they obtain has nothing to do with their daily life.
1.0	These news cannot assist to their school work or their hunting for jobs.
3.0	Never before in the history has the problem of education been so salient today.
3.0	Since people treat education more important ,parents try to take various of approches to inspire their children to study harder .
3.0	Among them ,one of the most controversy method is to credit children with money.
3.0	Although some people contends that the method's s advantage outweighes its drawback.
12.0	As far as I am concerned ,I am strongly aganist the idea for the following reasons.
6.0	To start with , to credit children with money can leave a wrong impression of study on childen.
8.0	It is no denying that we study for the purpose to attain knowledge and to improve ourselves but not for gaining money .
8.0	If we offer our children money , then our children may think that their purposes to study is to earn money.
8.0	I can still remenber that one of my classmates in my high school .
8.0	In our class , it is known to all that he did not lay stress on his study at all .
8.0	Whlie we are buring ourselves in our text books or our homework , he was doing other things which is ot related to study .
8.0	Asked why he didn not pay his attention on studying he explains that he saw no benifit in study .
8.0	He said that he was credit for studying when he was a child .
8.0	When he got a good grade , his parents are always waiting here to give him extra money .
8.0	But now as long as his parents did not offer him money any more , he saw no benefit in study.
2.0	what is more , childen may develop a habit of using their money causually when offered a lot of money.
7.0	It is shown that we do not
3.0	Never before inthe history has the problem of planing and organizing been such salient than today.
3.0	Nowadays, young people always think a lot about their future.
11.0	Some claim that it is important to have ability to planing and organizing for future development.
12.0	I think the sbility's drawares weight on its merits.
5.0	Planing and organizing paly an great sigenificant rolr in young people's development.
8.0	The young can decide their future direction and they will have a position of theirself so taht they will have a goal to make the effort to the goal.
8.0	Afriend of mine waant to be a desinger when she was 6, and shetake many extra-school classes on the weekends.
8.0	She put much effort on plainting and desinging.
8.0	Finally ,she was major inthe fashion desing.
8.0	Atually, all her plan and organize paly an important role in her dream.
5.0	Plan and organize can enhance their sense of dream.
8.0	Sense of dream ia important for growing up.
8.0	When a child become a adult, the different change is to have a dream.
8.0	Plan and organizition can cultivate children's program for their future development.
8.0	A dream is make of some small goal, when the child as a dream, she must divide the big dream into many goals, so plaing is a important skill, and plaing is a essential ability for young people to achieve thier big dream.
1.0	Attmitly, plan and organzition may destory a pure child, the child may think a lot after having a goal, and the most valuable things of the child was the innocent.
1.0	However, their parents can help them to organize their future as well.
7.0	Their parents have more experinence, so they can essentialy hep them, and the student and give their parents their own suggestion, and the dream will belongs to both of them, and some's power weight
3.0	Recently, an increasing number of parents prefer rewarding their children with money when their children get high grades in school.
11.0	Some people believe this behavior makes students study for money ,not for themselves.
6.0	While others consider that children worth rewarding becuase of their hard-working.
8.0	In my opinion, I agree with this measure.
8.0	Firstly, this behavior let chidren know money is not so easy to get.
8.0	Hence, children realize they should earn money by themselves through their efforts, and will cherish those money.
8.0	For instance, a famous biseness man in China give his son a large sum of money every month, so in his mind, he can get money easily from  his parents, so he use alot of money to buy toys and never study well.
8.0	Hwever his father realize it would distroy his son's life if he still let his son live like a prince, after that he told his son he would give him money if you get good grade or not.
8.0	His son can not accept it at first.
8.0	But he have to study well to earn money.
8.0	And he also relize the difficulty to get money.
8.0	According to this story, this is a good measure to teach children the difficulty of earning money.
1.0	Secondly, this behavior can force children to burry themselves on study.
1.0	If parents did not reward them anything when children get good grades, chidren may not insist on study.
8.0	For example, when my brother was young, he never get award even if he study well.
8.0	for the resuly he gradully think it was not useful to get good grade.
8.0	So give chidren money can let chidren think highly of studying and never give it up.
3.0	Nowdays with the inprovement of the ecnomic and the bussines the money become more and more important than before.
11.0	Having the ability to manage these money is avery necessary.
12.0	So for this opointment parents offer their children money for each high grade they get in the school  I agree with it .
12.0	Because it wil notice childen how to manage the money well, and now how to use them very efficiently.
4.0	Firstly, it will  teach children how to manage their money and how to use the limited money to do the largest things.
8.0	If the children get some money, they may very happy and buy some things they want to buy just like toies good look cloth.
8.0	And these high mark will notice them to manage these money very carefully.
8.0	They will pay attention to this money.
8.0	The number of this money is limited so if they buy the good clothes they will not have the remain money to eat meal.
8.0	The mark is something that notice the childen to pay these money after a deep think.
8.0	It is very good for their future, if they learn how to use this money efficiently from they are a boy, they may be a bank employeer or a successful bussiness man.
4.0	Secondly, to mark the money could avoid these money be lost.
8.0	We all know that the children may very uncerafully.
8.0	When they play or run they may lose these money.
8.0	It is what a pit for them to lose these valuable money.
8.0	If they were highly marked, they will be more remarkable and children could find them very rapidly.
8.0	Not only that they could find them nearby.
8.0	And this high mark could let the teacher know that these money belong to the children and through the redio find the children who lose these money.
4.0	However, to mark these money is to remarkable to some people who want to stolen these money.
8.0	But if we mark the money with other own style just like write name on the money.
8.0	By this way even though  the bad man get these money they also can not to use them.
8.0	This is because they may be catch.
1.0	ALL in all, marking the money have a lot of benefit.
1.0	So i agree with this.
12.0	Nowadays, there is an increasing numbers of parents who offer their school-aged children money for each high grade they get in school.
12.0	Most of parents love and care about their children.
11.0	Once their child get progress in their study, they give them money as gifts.
11.0	However, I don't deem that this is a good idea.
6.0	There are some effective ways for parents to encourage their child in study.
8.0	To begin with, money can not do everything.
8.0	Wtih the development of economic, more and more families have much income to support their life.
8.0	But money can influence children's mind.
8.0	They will never understand how their parents earn these money.
8.0	As well, parents should give their children more chances to experience the word not just offering their money.
8.0	Parents should help their child to hence their inner beauty, which is more important in their daily live.
8.0	Last but not least, studying should be a life-time things instead of short term learning.
2.0	From the above discussion, I will give you some examples happend besides me.
8.0	My little brother, who always being encouraged by money is have little interest in learning now.
8.0	He only wants to get money from his parents rather than study better.
8.0	So I strongly believe this is not a good idea.
3.0	As everyone knows,working whole day is really tiring,so how to make workers less tired?
3.0	According to investigation，wokers are more satisfied when they have many different types of tasks to do during the workday than when they do similar tasks all day long.
3.0	So why does this happen?
11.0	l think it may have these follow reasons.
5.0	First of all，it takes time for the brain to adjust and adapt in the middle of doing one thing to another.
8.0	Like if you do one thing from the begining to the end，you must feel boring tired even detest.
8.0	But if you start another thing from the middle of your first thing.
8.0	You may feel the second thing is novel.
8.0	For a simple example，if you think of music as your hobby，you will feel it interesting and attractive.
8.0	But once you think of music as your major,it must be boring and uninteresting.
8.0	This is one thing that is my own experience.
5.0	secondly，do different types of things can make you multi-activity.
7.0	whatever your body or your brain can get more ex
3.0	Many people says that the government can reduce the cost of police because no matter how much reward, the police can protect the citizens.
3.0	Other people may choose to decrease the cost of public transportation, after all, many family have private cars.
12.0	But I choose to cut down the financy of library for these reasons.
5.0	Firstly, many people don't need read cheap or free books in library.
8.0	This is because before the economic crises, most people already have their own book lists, namely that they have bought the books they favorate.
8.0	Nowadays, as the technology becomes so advanced, many people can read books on Internet, so a library seems less necessary than before.
8.0	On the contrary, if the governement cuts down the money in police, that can infulence the satisfaction of their career.
8.0	If the authority decrease the money on public transportation construct, there will be more traffic jam.
8.0	Both these cases lead to worse quality of people's life.
8.0	For example, my friend, Hong, studied at Hubei University.
8.0	Once the school undergoes the financial crisis, so they reduce the frequency of renewing the old books.
8.0	Many students don;t worry about this problem, including my friend.
8.0	Because they always reads book on devices, such as electronic books, smart phones, computer.
8.0	She never goes to the library.
8.0	So she never worries about whether school library is open and where the library is.
8.0	So the less resourse in library might not make significant problems.
5.0	Secondly, reducing the financial aid in police can create potential risks to the citizens.
8.0	This is because if the policeman get less money, they may complain about the occupation.
8.0	Even though, they feel responsible to protect the public, their families may complain.
8.0	In this case, they may cannot concentrate on their work.
8.0	Another proplem is that if the government cut the cost according to employe less police, more crimes may occur, with a sense of luck.
8.0	Finally, another choice is to reduce the cost of public transportation.
8.0	Even though many family have private cars, too many cars may cause damage to environment which may need more money to manage.
8.0	Too many cars also can lead to traffic jam.
8.0	That can decrease the satisfaction of settlements.
2.0	To sum up, I choose to reduce library during economic crises.
3.0	Good health is prerequisite of  future success for university students.
11.0	Therefore, sports and social activities are essential for students' daily life.
5.0	Initially, Nowadays people need to be more skilled in social interaction.
8.0	That is because an increasing number of business require people who are not only specialised in their fields.
8.0	And also no taks can be done by a single person, so the social skills and team collaboration are necessary for any future success.
8.0	Obviously, sports and social activites in universities provides students with a wonderful place to practice their social skils such as playing football in a team or joining a debate group.
8.0	During the team work, students can develop team spirit and friendship which are important in building  future career.
5.0	Moreover, sports and social activites can improve students' efficiency since those activities can release stress and keep healthy.
9.0	I remember when I was in the middle school, I felt frustrated and tired due to the large amount of assginments, and even the pressure from study damaged my physical health.
9.0	Then, I joined a PE Club in order to keep fit.
7.0	Gradually, I discovered playing sports is not a good stress reducer, but also can
11.0	I disagree this statement.
11.0	Watching a movie is better that doing physical exercise.
11.0	Because  doing phisical exercise need use your hands and keep thinking.
11.0	It is not like to relax.
5.0	First of all,I think if you are doing physical exercise your body will be healthy.
8.0	compare to watching a movie.
8.0	If you are doing physical exercise,you may be want to have more scores or want to do some handsome movement.
8.0	And if you are failed,you will try again.
8.0	It practice your body and let you away from ill.
8.0	For my experiences,If I atching a movue for two hours ,My etes will be very tired.
8.0	And when you watching movie，I will eat some snack.
8.0	It will let you become more fat.
8.0	Fat is not good for healthy.
8.0	But if i playing bastetball,,my eyes don't feel tired.
8.0	And I will eat more riceor somrthing which have more energr or vatamins.
5.0	The second reason I think you will not feel alone.
8.0	Because I think relax more likely from your heart.
8.0	If you are playing basketball,you will have partners and you will coorporated and communicated to learn some skills.
8.0	And you will enjoy spare the happenies and enjor you have the frienf know you and can understand you.
8.0	Not like movie ,it more like the thing who are one person do.
8.0	no one communicated.
1.0	Also doinf exercise also have some advantages,maybe some times you will injuryed.
1.0	And this will effect your normal lifes .
12.0	i do not agree this is a good idea.
12.0	school-age children are too young to take much money,if you regard this as  a good idea,it can be supposed that your child will regard studying as a task,and then they will have a thoughts that they study not for themselves, but for parents.
12.0	so i do not support this point.
6.0	And secondly,child get high marks that is an excellent thing .
8.0	for this thing,we should be proud for our children.
8.0	but if you give money as a award to your child ,that have mislead your child to a worng brief.
8.0	they may do everything in the exam for money which may contral children soul.
8.0	we should declind this risk,instead of money,we can give chlid a spiritual reward and suplus a little money .
3.0	In th mordern society, there are a lot of rules that people should to follow.
3.0	such as what time that people need to sleep or what thing that people need to do in some occations.
11.0	This is because people usually think that rules can make people become better and better.
11.0	However, those rules could not fit in every person, like young people.
10.0	Some people claim that young people should follow the rules so that they can remain the good impress for other people, but some poeple think that young people would not to obey those rules, because they are very young, they will konw how to do.
11.0	Personally, I believe that young people could not follow those rules, because they are very young, they have their own thinking.
5.0	First of all, young people are very creative so that sometime they have some new ideas.
8.0	Perhaps, they can create and invent some new thing that people are not find it before.
8.0	However, if have some rules to control them, they might be have no chance to continue and develop their ideas.
8.0	For example, everyday people need to fo to school or go to work, but sometime it will have traffic jam, so they might be late or absent.
8.0	However, young people are very creative and engetic, they could find a new way that to figure that out.
8.0	Such as creat a new appication on the cellpone that to help people to solve that problem.
8.0	Convervely, if it have a lot of items that they need to obey, even though they are have some new ideas, they could not to achieve that goal.
5.0	Secondly, a lot of restriction will limited young people to develop a new thing.
8.0	As we know, young people will have a lot of good idea, because they are very young and they want to find a new thing to enrich their life.
8.0	So they might be want try some nes things that make their life more fantastic.
8.0	For instance, some things that ole people will not to try it, such as jump.
8.0	Old people will think that is very dangerous, so they will not try it, so they will not know how interst to play that.
8.0	H
10.0	Ademittedly,
3.0	Nowadays, people's eager for high quality Internet access and convenient public transportation is increasing day by day.
3.0	Frankly speaking, I am persuaded that it's more important for government to spend money to improve public trasportation than to improve Internet access.
12.0	Here are my reasons.
6.0	First of all, with public transportation improved, more and more people will choose public transportation rather than drive their own cars, for it's quicker and cheaper.
8.0	In addition, less polluted gas will be produced and then the environment will be much better.
8.0	On the contrary, improving Internet access will do no good to the environment.
8.0	For example,  Second, current Internet access is enough for most of us.
8.0	So improving Internet access will benefit less people than improving public transportation.
8.0	Additionally, quicker Internet connection will probably make people addicted to computer games, which will do great harm to them.
8.0	For example, one of my friends used to be addicted to games.
8.0	But in some period of time, the connection of Internet always fail, he so was angry that he uninstalled the game and began to study very hard for playing game is miserable.
2.0	Last but not least, convenient public transportation will spend less time on the way and thus increase people's efficience.
9.0	For example, lots of people live far from their company, so they have to get up very early to catch the bus or subway because it will take a long time to get to the company.
9.0	But getting up early will make people sleepy and even damage their healthy, which will in turn work slowly.
7.0	As a result of this, public transportation is far more important than Inter
3.0	The life of modern people is at a high speed, most humans hurry to go to work, school or back to home, so seldom individuals will have time or vigor to help others.
11.0	In this situation, I don't think that people today are more willing to help the stuggling strangers.
5.0	First, people have no time to stop for a stranger.
9.0	Nowadays, lots of people are very busy to get to their company or school.
9.0	If they are late, adults may lose their pay or get fired, and students will be criticized by their teachers, as a consequence of which, i think major prople wii not stop to help stuggling strangers even though they want.
5.0	Second, there are an increacing number of cheaters in the world, and they may pretend to be a stuggling strangers in order to kite your money or they may hurt you to achieve their aim.
9.0	So it may be dangerous to help a stuggling strangers.
9.0	Due to that many similar cases have happened, less people will chose to help stuggling strangers.
10.0	Third,
8.0	I agree with that parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.
8.0	Primarily, only when children experience the consequence of making mistakes can they learn to shoulder responsibilities individually.
8.0	Many parents indulge their children in thier childhood, neglecting the mistakes their children make or taking the responsibilities for them .
8.0	Therefore, the children become rude and defiant, having a great possibility to harm the society when they grow up.
8.0	It's a significant ability for an adult to tell black from white, which should be cultivated when one is young.
8.0	Parents sho Secondly, children who can learn from their own mistakes can cultive the ability to solve accidental difficulties in their future.
8.0	Most children only make small mistakes in an early age, but how to solve them properly infects their future performance greatly.
8.0	If one can't deal with trivial matters ,how can he become a big deal!
8.0	When a child starts to reflect on himself, he is just step on the right track.
8.0	He may not make the same mistake again because he already has known why he made the previous one.
8.0	If a child doesn't do his homework, he will be punished by his teacher.
8.0	And the child will have deeper memory about the shame ,so he won't let the same situation happen again.
10.0	Considering all analysis above, it's clear that parents should let their children make mistakes and learn from them.
12.0	To encourage their children to stduy hard, some parents may reward their children with money for thier high grade in school.
11.0	I think it's a very hlepful way in educate kids.
4.0	Firstly, when children were rewaded for their effort in stdudy, they will have more interest in thier study and have a sense of accomplishment.
8.0	These are postive in education of children.
8.0	Now, children are faced with more and moer pressure of competiton.
8.0	If the kids always study in high pressure without materially encouragement, they may surfer from the boredom of study.
4.0	Secondly, giving children money can cultivate in their ability of managing money matters.
9.0	They can earliy think the most proper way in using money and they will find it useful when they deal with thier income in the future .
9.0	And this ablity is very necessary but always paid no attention to.
4.0	Rewarding children with their progress can be more beneficail in educating children.
9.0	Because children can be encouraged without the sense of loss when campared with other excellent students.
9.0	And with their gradual progress they will feel the same proud as the excellent students.
10.0	So I really agree with these p
3.0	It is no doubt that the world is changing every second.
3.0	But what about the people who live on the earth?
11.0	People say they feel less pleasnt and content than those who were in the past.
12.0	For my part, I totally differentiated on that part.
5.0	The world is developing to a much more international word with the international transportation and Internet.
8.0	Things have more possibilities, as for our human beings.
8.0	In the past , we were just constrained in our hometown,having no fast and moderately way to tour around the world.
8.0	And also most of what  we  know just from mouth-to-mouth saying is from the elder relatives or tutors.
8.0	With the advent of fast transpotation and Internet , you are closely inter-woven in to the world, knowing anecdotes from Steven Jobos and making e-pals on the otherside.
5.0	The world  creates more chances for everyone to strive for his dreams.
8.0	More chances means more channels.
8.0	If you are not good at studing, you can just transfer into the field that really fit yourself.
8.0	In the past, that everyone views doing the study is the only way to make a prosperous career.
8.0	Those who can not do well in the study are looked down upon and hold nothing to say.
8.0	Look the moment now, people can thrive in the different channles, such as trading, computing, accouting, even cooking.
0.0	People's less satisfation don't lie in the outside world but within the inner heart.
0.0	If one doesn't take every possible chance and try his utmost, I am sure, he can make nothing.
0.0	Those who are quite successful , to some degrees, seize every second and strive hard to fulfill their dreams with possible techniques.
0.0	So, to put all in to a nut-shell,don't blame the world for not satisfying your needs and desire.
0.0	The changing world offers you a varity of channels and ways and you should closely take every chance to make yourself from nobbdy to somebody.
12.0	In a day when different countries are more and more closely connected, people pay high attention on international affairs even though some events are unlikely to effect their daily lifes, and I am one of those people.
12.0	From my point of view, it is significant to learn about international events.
4.0	Firstly, knowing what happens around the world can help people make more preparations for the future.
9.0	Nowadays, there is growing trend that schools and companies send students or works abroad for further learning.
9.0	And to gathering this opportunity, one must have some basic knowing about other countries, which could be obtain through browsing through some events happened in other countries.
4.0	Secondly, it is also helpful to make some international friends.
10.0	Knowing about some international events can help people when they talk to foreigners, thus making it more possible to make friends with them.
4.0	I adimit that in modern society, people are busy with their school tasks or works, and it seems a waste of time to care about something happening in other countries which have little influence on our daily life.
8.0	But from my point of view, in a time when informantional technology is highly developed, those events can be easily and quickly gained on the internet.
8.0	What's more, with the smartphone, one can use his sparse time to read pieces of international news on some news websites.
8.0	Thus, time will not be a big problem in knowing about international events.
2.0	Based on all three reasons listed above, I support the opinion that it is necessary to know about events happening around the world.
11.0	With the development our living standard, in present-day society, there are more various approaches for individuals to gain entertainment.
12.0	Traveling is a favorable avenue for people to expand their outlook and get closed to nature, taking the issue of traveling into consideration, many people have the assertion that traveling their own country is better than from traveling to foreign countries for the sake of sense of familar.
12.0	However, I have the convinction that I prefer to trave to foreign countries even more distant place.
5.0	First of all, it is a really valuable and meaningful opportunity for individuals to have a visit to foreign countries for the purpose that not only can us appreciate a huge number of different scenery but also explore every avenue toward some unpredicted exprience, which might enbale us become more brave and confident.
8.0	For instance, many people who come back from a foreign visiting are becoming extremely brave.
8.0	And whenever they meet some dilemma, being prepared gives one enough confidence to rise to the occasion and deliver what they know best.
8.0	That is to say, during the trip, you must be front of and tackle countless problems, which is conductive to shape your personality.
5.0	On top of that, thousands of newspapers and magazines always show that there are some trip groups that is beneficial for us to make some new friends.
8.0	Certainly.
8.0	possosing a wider and sphosticated social network can take enormous advantages to our life.
8.0	To illstrate, my sister is a successful entrepreneur and she runs a multinational corporation in the United State.
8.0	At firt, she runs a start-up in China.
8.0	However, last summer, she participated in  a foreign countries trip and she socialized with many similar people.
8.0	Therefore, when she arised the viewpoint that runing a cutting-edge corporation in United State, many people are in favor of it, and expand money on this project.
8.0	Had she not join in the foreign countries traveling, she wound not have the chance to socialize with national persons and been such a distinguished woman.
0.0	Adimittedly.
0.0	it is true that have a traveling in our own country is strongly convinent and safe because we are familar with the city.
0.0	However, compared with the convinence and safey, having a unpredicted experience is more important.
7.0	Therefore, from my perspective, I t
12.0	Some people argue as if it is a general truth that people today are more willing to help the struggling strangers,but to be frank,i cannot agree with them.
8.0	there are some reasons why i hold no confidence on them，and i would explora a few primary of ones here.
8.0	nowadays,although there are more and more positive energy things happened，also there are many immoral things appear.
8.0	The reason why people don't dare to do good things is that some people who helped others have been framed by others.
8.0	For example, old people fall are common things,but some of them use kind people to make moner,once you teach the old man,the man will catch you and ask you for pay.
6.0	The thing like this is`very common in China,so meet the thing like this,people often choose to ignore,even if the man was actually fall down,they just walk over.
9.0	how do you treat others, they will treat you as the same way.
9.0	so if everyone treat others kindly,the world will become better!
3.0	As the progress of soceity ,people awalys think young people have no influence on the important decision that determine the future of society.
12.0	however ,I disagree with the stetament.
11.0	I hve two reasons for this.
5.0	First,young people decision can improve future .
8.0	For example ,if a young people decide he dosen't he go to work or study.
8.0	He will has no benefit can give social.
8.0	By that I mean ,young people can decision them wherther to become bad or justice.
5.0	second,because young people have good imagination than old man .
8.0	For example ,in my family ,I have a earld brother and he like painting ,so one day I come back home ,and saw he was painting .
8.0	I went to see what does he painting ,but I cann't understood what he painting .
8.0	so I ask him what dose he painting ,then he said :I decide to become a teacher in the future ，because I think teacher can help young child to become better .
8.0	Therefore  ,I started to think what I think in the same age.
8.0	By that I mean, young people have them- self  decision ,if old people interupt chlid opinoin .
8.0	mybe it will become bad.
3.0	Nowadays, education is the most important part in people's life.
12.0	Many parents always ask their kids to gain as higher scores as they can.
12.0	However, it is controversial that whether parents should pay for their children's high marks they get in exams.
11.0	Some believe it will bring benefits for the kids, while others hold the opinions that it will not work in the long run.
12.0	In my opinion, spending money for children's success is very conducive since it motivates the young and improves their skills.
4.0	First, reciving the money from parents implies children to work hard in academics.
8.0	They will feel confident and motivated due to the benefits and expexts from parents.
8.0	They will study even harded to earn their parents' awards and satisfactions with them.
8.0	Take my experiences as an example.
8.0	When I was in third grade, I was terrible at math.
8.0	I did not know what the equation meant and had trouble figuring out how to divide 205 by 3.
8.0	I got frustrated and refused to work hard.
8.0	But one day my mother told my that if I could gain a 90 on my math exam next time, I would have 10 yuan to buy anything I wanted.
8.0	At that time I was so attracted to toy dolls and I dreamed of buying one doll called Rosie.
8.0	So I worded hard, even though I did not like this subject.
8.0	I raised my hand in class to gain every chance to answer the question and I asked my teacher to help me better understand the concepts in class.
8.0	As a result, in the final exam, I got 98 which was the highest score in my class.
8.0	Thus, in this case, my mother motivated me to learn a subject I failed to understand and used the money to help me gain the interest or the confidence in study.
4.0	Second, other skills would be enhanced if the parents give their children money.
8.0	Students could improve their time management skills since they need to make a balance between study to get the money and their leisure time.
8.0	When one child wants to play Angry Birds, he will notice that he needs to finish his homework first and then play the game.
8.0	So instead of starting to use his iPhone as soon as he returns home, he will make himself a schedule and requires himself to finish the task in half an hour with full attention.
8.0	Another one is that they can become self-displined.
8.0	Consider the cited example.
8.0	The child may desire to play the game so much, but he will force himself to study because he knows what is more worthy spending his time.
8.0	So rather than do whatever he wants as usual, he clearly knows what his plan is and will  perform the plan step by step.
4.0	Although it may seem that children could rely on the money to study, it is not normally the scenes.
9.0	Based on experiments and observations make by researchers, it could be easily conclude that compared with children who are not offer the money, the children who are provided have much more interests in one subject than the other gropu even at the beginning they both refuse to learn.
9.0	So students not only become more interested and confident in study, but also they care about study itslf rather than money in the end.
2.0	In conclusion, money brings children with great motivations and improved skills which will in teh long term benefit the students' future careers.
3.0	Giving fund for the high score student is a normanl sign in every school, most people claim that that this is a promotion for the stuendt whose stuay really good.
11.0	That is ture, but i do not agree this idea, that may bring more negative effects we have not considered yet.
5.0	Firstly it may be a hit for those stuendt who did not get the ward.
10.0	Like what i said, it may be good promotion for some student, but some stuendts may lose their confidence of their study, and feel unfair if he is also working hard in the study, and they may give up studying get low grades.
5.0	secondly, it may bring the violent in school.
8.0	Because only a few stuendts can win the award.
8.0	So those students who did not get the money may jealous the high-mark students, and they might do some extreme things to have a balance.
8.0	Like fight, that will give a bad mood  in the school At last, it may cause a opportunity cost in school fund, there will be a plenty of high-score student, giving money to them may lose a high percentage of school's fund, and the school can use those to buy more capitals, or hiring more labours to work for the school, increase the productivicity of the education, do a much more meaningful thing, instead of giving money to the high-mark student.
0.0	In conclusion, giving money may be a good  action, but its drawback is much visible that the advantages.
0.0	Such as causing violent action, giving negative influence to other students, or losing a big part of fundrasing.
0.0	With a much healthier atmosphere and better resources in shcool, stuendts will must be given a high quality of education, and finally give out a best results in their future study.
12.0	In everyday situations, parents are inclind to award their children's excellent behavior.
9.0	For example, school-age children are prvided with money for each high grade.
9.0	From my perspective, I consider it appropriate by the following reasons: giving encouragement, developing a wonderful conception, improving the education system's structure.
6.0	Firstly, it encourage children to work harder.
8.0	To be more specific, money enlarge the sense of achievement in children's heart, letting inspiration go through minds for kids to move on on the way of chasing his dream.
8.0	Take me as an example, when in middle school, my parents offered me a scholarship for entering a key class, which help me to strengthen my force into studying.
8.0	By listenning the class carefully, doing the homework seriousely, asking questions to teachers Secondly,  it developed a conception in children's mind that learning new things is equal to having fun.
8.0	Though there are worries about the unsustainability of this incentive method.
8.0	I believe school-age children being prvided with money for each high grade is a good method.
11.0	As we all know, more and more people are aware of the importance of comprehensive development,and people should learn to balance their study and the social activities.
12.0	Some people believe that students should be given more time to do whatever they want while others think that children should spend more time on doing homework or participating in organized activities.
11.0	As far as I'm concerned, there is no need to spend more time on what they want.
12.0	My viewpoint is based on the following reasons and examples.
5.0	In the first place, if a child want to have a promising future and decent work, they have to spend time on homework and relative activities.
8.0	As is known to us, doing homework help children to review the school life and equip them with much knowledges.
8.0	What's more, the homework is conducive to building a better foundation.
8.0	It's is essential for us to have a good command of the basic knowledge which helps us to adapt the future work.
8.0	For example, my friends, Mike, who are always doing homework hard and participate the organized activities.
8.0	He believes that the planned assignment helps him a lot.
8.0	Now, he is a trainee in Baidu.
5.0	In the second place,   doing homework and organized activities help children develop a good social ability.
8.0	Admittedly, allowing more timefor children to do whatever they want have some advantages, such us stimulating their potential to the fullest.
8.0	For example, a boy named John,started to learn painting in the childhood and his mother always gives her much supports and never make her discouraged.
8.0	And now she was admitted to the best art university.
8.0	However,doing whatever they want always make children do more wrong things.
8.0	As we all know , children are always too young to make a correct choice.
8.0	So parents have more exper   To put it into  a nutshell, I believe that children should spend their time doing homework and relative activities.
8.0	It's helpful for them to find a decent job and develop a good social ability.
3.0	For recent years, it is more and more popular to relax by watching movies or reading books.
3.0	Actually we do have learned a lot through these relaxing ways.
3.0	This kind of relaxing ways helps us to get knoledge and we can get happiness via watching movies or reading books.
11.0	However, I think taking part in physical exercise is the best way to relax.
10.0	It can help us to get much happiness than watching movies does.
5.0	From my point of view, taking part in sports can help you to know the meaning of working together.
8.0	As we know, there are lot of sports that we need to work together such as soccer, basketball and volleyball.
8.0	These kind of sports require the spirit of unity from players.
8.0	"There is old saying says"" Working together helps you get higher""."
8.0	When we take part in these physical exercise for relax, we can get the meaning of this spirit.
8.0	It is important to us to know that we need to be great for our group.
5.0	Second, we can get heathier through doing physical exercise.
8.0	In recent years, people don't like going outside while they stay at home playing games or watching movies.
8.0	A healthy body is the most important to a humankind.
8.0	"There is a vivid example provides a strong evidence that one of my friends ""xiaoming‘’ don't like to playing sports, so he is always so weak that he needs to go to hospital twice a month."
8.0	In my opinion, playing sports not only help you to get healthier in body, but also it helps you to be optimistical.
8.0	A person who like play sports is alway full of energy to the future.
8.0	That kind of people can be great in any aspects.
0.0	According to the reason above, taking parts in physcal exercise helps us a lot.
0.0	We can be better and better through playing sports.
0.0	As you can see how fascinating the playing sports is.
0.0	So I think taking part in physical exercise is the best way to relax.
3.0	As a celebrated dictum says, a friend in need is a friend indeed.
11.0	That's to say, people are likely to help friends who are in great trouble.
12.0	With time going on and economy booming, common are the occasions when people are willing to help the struggling strangers out of pure good will.
11.0	Thus, I agree with the statement that people today are more willing to help the struggling strangers, especially compared to the past.
4.0	When it comes to the reasons why people today are more willing to the struggling strangers, my reasons can be listed as follows.
8.0	To begin with, with the economy booming, people can earn more money than in the past, thus becoming wealthier.
8.0	Therefore, when confronted with a struggling stranger asking for help, people are likely to think less about the economic consequence of their good will.
8.0	That's to say, they think less of the cost their contributions than in the past, so they are more willing to help the struggling strangers.
4.0	Moreover, giving aid to struggling strangers is more likely to make people feel content than in the past.
8.0	I'd like to cite myself as a vivid example.
8.0	When I was a sophomore, I once encountered a beggar on street, weeping sorrowly and waiting for help.
8.0	I gave her what I could offer and she asked my telephone number.
8.0	To my great surprise, she sent me a message about how my contribution could change her world, which I considered to be very little myself.
8.0	Thanks to modern technology, I felt extremely content that my slightest contribution counted.
4.0	Last but not least, thanks to the Internet and modern technology, giving aid has become much more convenient.
8.0	For example, there are websites specialized in raising funds, where people can donate a few money by applications such as Alipay.
8.0	By means of Internet, raising funds have become more swift and more convenient.
8.0	Therefore, people today are more willing to help the struggling strangers, because of convenience.
2.0	Taking what I mentioned above into consideration, we can safely draw a conclusion that people today are more willing to help the struggling strangers because they are better off, they can feel more content and giving aid has become more convenient.
3.0	Some parents offer the school-age money for each high mark they get in school,I think it is a uesfull thing to encourage their children to get a high mark,so I believe this is a good idea.
12.0	At a matter of fact ,my parents have done the same thing on me ,and finaly I really realize my dream,so I can not agree this idea more.
12.0	There are some reasons why I consist it.
6.0	First of all,parents should offer the lowest money to their childen.
8.0	Then if their childen get a high mark in school,the parents should give them some awards to encourage them.
8.0	As soon as the childen get the award ,they will maybe study harder than before,because they believe if they did better,they will get the award again.
8.0	So did I.Second,through this method,we can make our childen know only they make the effort,they could harvest.
8.0	I think this is a good habbit for everyone.
8.0	There is harvest effoets,efforts has harvested.
8.0	Then the thrid one,this way can really imporve the childen's living quality.
8.0	If they want to buy some thing by themselves,they have to study hard to get each high mark.
8.0	Through the process,the childen have learned more knowlege than before,this is our aim that makes them wise.
12.0	As for the work arrangement for the worker ,some people think doing the same tasks everyday will eliminish the difficulties for workers so that make them more satisfied about their job.
12.0	But I strongly belive multiple tasks will keep the workers mor energetic and concerntrated in the job.
4.0	Firstly,the workers will more easily to get tired when they just do similar tasks than do different types .
8.0	It is known that the specific activity we perform is acutately controled by the paticular district in our brain.
8.0	When we repeat that activity for a long time ,that part of brain  will be overused .
8.0	On the contrary,when you alternate different chores ,you let different part of your brain take breaks in turn,and in that case you will not get fatigue so soon,thus will improve the satisfaction towards the work.
4.0	In addition,when workers change from one chores to another ,there will be a sense of freshness ,whereas doing the same tasks lastingly will make one feel the work is tediousand get bored.
8.0	This is applied to all of us.
8.0	Imagine a scene you are a student in school and one morning you find that your classed today are all mathematics ,from the begining of the school to the last minit.
8.0	What will you feel at this time?
8.0	Would you want to attent to school in this situation?
8.0	And that is why students have different classes in a day.
8.0	Similarly ,various type of tasks avoid the workers feeling boring about their work.
4.0	Last but not least,workers who do the repeated task easily get distraction ,which is bad thing in their career development.
8.0	Research have found that poeple who repeat the same activity for a long time go through hard time to focus ,and consequently will make more mistakes.
8.0	That will have negative infulence in the worker's promotion,and it may cause punishment.
8.0	When workers cannot see a bright future of their job,the will be less satisfied.
1.0	To sum up,workers  will feel better when do different types of job.
1.0	This should be a principal when arrange the work day.
3.0	It is nomal that most of the students in university want to be succesfuls in the future job.
12.0	Some of them think studying hard ar school and being capable in the future job is significant.
12.0	Others attach greater importance on the ability of relating well to people.
11.0	In my perspective, I think studying hard in school is more important.
10.0	The reasons are as below.
4.0	First of all, the accomplish you will get in the future job bases on the knowledge you learn in school.
8.0	Without the knowledge you have learnt, you will not finish your assignment.
8.0	For example, if you want to be a reseachor in the future, you will not be able to finish your paper without the knowledge you are learning in school.
8.0	Futhermore, if you want to be successful, productive and creative in the field you study, you will study deeper than what teachers have told you in shool.
4.0	On the top of that, studying hard in school can also cultivate some personalities that can not be gained by relating well to people.
8.0	The ability to persist on one thing, the ability to think in different aspects of a problem, the ability to keep confident when you are in troubles can be cultivate when you are studying hard in school.
8.0	And the ability above is of great importance in the future job.
8.0	However, the process of relating to people can not help you to develope these ability.
4.0	Admittedly, the ability to relate well to people is important.
8.0	However, if one spends a lot of time on relating people, there is not enough time for him or her to think how to do a better job.
8.0	You maybe do as whar people told you instead of being creative and perfect in the work.
8.0	The standard of being sucessful is not how well you can relate well to people but how much and how well you do in the job.
1.0	For the reasons above.
1.0	I heartfully agree with the statement that studying hard in school is more significant than the ability to relate well to people for success in a future job.
11.0	I agree that parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their mistakes.
5.0	Frirst,when we make mistakes we will gain more experince than those who get over the problems with parents' help.
8.0	In this way the faliure will be much more remarkable for us.
8.0	For example, when I was a little girl ,my mom always compaulse me to learn English and memorize words as much as I can.
8.0	I don't qiute understand the importance of learning English till I was laughed by other classmates for my poor English grades.
8.0	Instead of geting hurt ,I will certainy grow faster and stronger and be more determind to learning it better.
5.0	Second,always being protected by our parents won't be a wise choice.
10.0	As time goes ,not only does this kind of protection reduce the ability of dealing problems independently,but also makes us become lazier.
1.0	Last but not least,I appealing to the youth,be more independent and face the dificculties bravely without asking parents for help.
1.0	Because our parents can not company with us foerever,the day,which we will finally face all the chanllenges ,will come.
3.0	These days, the opinons of celebrities has played an critical role in the society and has been discussed among public with much enthusiasm.
11.0	Some people holds that celebrities, which involved in entertainers and sports stars, are more significant to younger people rather than older people.
11.0	In my perspective, the viewpoint is reasonable to some degree and several argurments will be revealed to support the opinion.
5.0	It should not be ignored that the technology and ecomony have reached remarkable achivement and improvement in recent years.
8.0	Put in another word, it indeed provides an effective approach for people to keep in touch with the imformation about celebrities.
8.0	Compare with older people, younger people are more concerning about the news of their thier idols or the celebrities which they admired.
8.0	The reason is that it is easier for younger people to use high technology, such as computers or mobile phones to receive information from outside.
8.0	Moreover, they are more likey to chat with peers online or face to face  in order to discuss about the news about these stars.
8.0	However, older people prefer to stay at home and watch some TV programs about politics, sports or dramas.
8.0	They pay less attention on the opinons of these celebrities, especially for the entertainment.
5.0	It also should be noticed that most of the younger people have not set up correct values of their lifes and they are more likey to be disturbed and even follow other's opinons or behaviors.
10.0	Differently, older people gained more knowledge from their experiences, it is easier for them to judge the perspectives from celebrities without any preferances.
2.0	Overall, it considers that the opinons of celebrities have much impact on younger people instead of older people based on the receiving degree of the techlonogy and thier life values.
12.0	Every parent loves their children, so when their children get in school, they also offer their school-age money for each high grade.
8.0	I think it's a good idea for their children, because their children will be encouraged by the parents, and they also want to get more gain, they will more work hard for study.
8.0	When I was a child, my parents always got this way for me that I could study hard.
8.0	I will tell you why I think about this statement.
5.0	Firstly, no pay, no gain.
8.0	This sentence mean, if you want to pay for study hard, you will have the gain(money).
8.0	This way is good for a child, the first one is they will know this sentence mean which no pay, no gain.
8.0	It's a benefit for children.
8.0	For example, it will have a good habit that do everything, they will try their best to get the higher payment.
8.0	When they know this sentence mean, they will know pay can get the gain.
8.0	Then, they don't be some people who always wants to get the gain for no pay.
8.0	It's really benefit for the children.
5.0	Secondly, this way can improve the active for the children.
8.0	For example, when I was a child, my parents always told me to get a best grade in my class.
8.0	If I have a good grade, they will give me a chance that I wanted to get something, they could gave me for immediately.
8.0	After that, I always thought some different ways that I could get a good grade, such as review what I learned from the class, preview what is I don't learn from the teacher teaches.
8.0	After I get a good grade, I get the everything that I want to and I have the best grade in my class.
1.0	In conclusion, to offer their school-age children money for each high grade when they get in school is a good idea.
1.0	It can help you to have a good habit, know this sentencethat no pay, no gain and improve your active for study.
10.0	Good Behaviors Worth Pay
3.0	When I was very young, everytime I achieved tasks or behaviored well, my parents would give money to me as a prize.
12.0	I uesd it for candies, pens and toys.
12.0	I was very delighted and determined to make better.
6.0	When the topic comes to if parents should offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.
8.0	I totally agree.
8.0	Maybe someone implies that we could not make children too reality, kids should be innocent in their age.
8.0	If kids get used of gaining money in this way, they are depented.
8.0	All I want to say is that parents should teach their kis correct how-to-ues-money and how- to gain-money methods, even be an example for the young.
8.0	So thay tell what the money is uesd for correctly.
8.0	Then, parents can not give a large amount of money to kids because it's too dangerous.
8.0	I heard a piece of news last day that a child spent 10million in a vedio player as a gift.
8.0	When a boy did something wrong, who is to blame?
8.0	His parents, of course.
8.0	He do not even know how many year his parents gain 10million.
8.0	How tough to make a living is what to teach.
8.0	That's parents' tasks.
9.0	As I mentioned, a tiny amount of money parents should give as a prize to show admitness.
9.0	And kids who gain money by his own behavior by himself will be  more pleased and will try to get the next amount of money.
2.0	All these become a good circle.
12.0	It is universally acknowledged that good tourism industry can bring a considerable fanancial income to cities and facilitate the city's prosperity, so decisions on how to improve the city to attarct tourists should be carefully choose by goverment.
12.0	Some suggest that to attract tourists, goverment should hire more police to improve the city's safety, while others think to improve the appearance by improving the old buildings and streets is a more effective way to appeal guests.
12.0	As for me, I'll join the next group to suggest the goverment contribute to the improving of its appearance.
12.0	My viewpoint is supposed by reasons below.
6.0	Renewing those old buildings and street to highlight their distinct and unique style can be a important attraction to tourists.
7.0	Although those old buidings and streets have contained part of the city is character which shows its culture,
12.0	Recently, there is a heated discussion abou not only the students who major history but also all students nee be required to take history courses.
12.0	Some people believe that learning history can help students to realize the their homeland and the worlds change.
11.0	However,other hold a dissmilar viewpoint that required the students to study the thing that the do not interest is wrong.
11.0	As for me, i agree with the latter one.
10.0	Myreasons and examples are listed as follows.
5.0	One reason why i am infavor of my perspective is that requireing student to study history will result them disgust history.
8.0	This is because requireing students to learn will make them feel boring and hate it, which will let the students learning history negative.
8.0	A good example of this is my experience, when i was a elementary school student, my mom used to ask me to learn playing the piano, but for me, i did not have interest in it , so i can not ply the piano until now .
8.0	As the example suggests, requi
5.0	Another relevant reason used to support my opinion is that  .
8.0	This is due to the fact that  ,which    .
8.0	A typical illustration of this can be seen in    .
8.0	The example indicates that
1.0	In conclusion, theoretically and practically speak,   is rewarding choice.
1.0	Not only cant it   .
7.0	but also
11.0	With the great development of technology, it is much easier for people to get information from the Internet.
12.0	Some people hold the view that the Internet provides people with a lot of valuable information.
12.0	While others say that access to so much information creates problems.
11.0	As far as  I am concerned, I think it is easier for people to absorb valuable information from the Internet.
10.0	Here are the reasons.
4.0	Firstly, everyone may have own phone and they can surf the Internet wherever they are.
8.0	It is much easier for them to get the useful information they want to solve the problem when they are in trouble.
8.0	For example, last month, I went to Japan to enjoy my vacation.
8.0	When I took off the airplane, I did not know how to go to my hotel.
8.0	I solved this problem with my phone.
8.0	I used google map to search the way to my hotel.
8.0	I followed the guidance of the Internet and easily arrive at my hotel.
4.0	Secondly, if people want to get some knowledge without the Internet, the only way they can use is to search for the information in the books.
8.0	This process will take them a lot of time and money.
8.0	But it is easier to search in the Internet.
8.0	Last week, I should finish my paper.
8.0	I should get some information about the history of China.
8.0	So I searched it in the Internet and got a high score.
4.0	However, some people disagree with me in the reason that access to so much informaion may creates problems.
8.0	They think that young may be influenced by criminal movies and rob their classmates or hurt others.
8.0	But this argument is not reasonable.
8.0	The parents should take care of their children and stop children to see these movies.
8.0	So the Internet will not create many problems.
1.0	Above what I said, the Internet could help people to get a lot of valuable information as they want.
1.0	Our daily life and society will become much brighter with the help of Internet.
11.0	In my opinion, it is significant to know about events happening all over the world,even though it seems like having nothing to do with our daily routines.
12.0	As a person ,we should be curious about the outside world, we are supposed to have sympathy for the poor,we have to devote to the communication with other parts of the world.
5.0	Knowing about the rest of the world enables us to embarce different lifestyles, values,making us more tolerant and peceful.
8.0	Take myself as an example,I live in wuhan for a long time and quite familiar with the food,the accent,the transpotation in wuhan,but my parents requires me to read newapapers and magazines since I was a little kid.
8.0	So I develop a good habit of accepting differences and never complaining about someting I am not satisfied with.
8.0	After graduating from high school,I leave for Beijing for further study,although I am not accustomed to the environment here,I try to accept it and gradually I fall in love with the city.
5.0	Being exposed to the outside world can broaded our horizons and open up our eyes to the outside world.
8.0	We can acquire interesting knowledge and relevant background about a certain issue,which is very essential not only for our studies as well as being a graceful person.
8.0	One of my best friends are full of curiosity,when he learned that the England voted to leave the union, he really wondered the reasons.
8.0	So he surfed the internet,looked up materials in the library.
8.0	He finally made it and became an expert in Enland history.
8.0	I really admired him,and he is such a fascinating man.
2.0	Last but not the least, it is significant to know about events happening all over the world,even though it seems like having nothing to do with our daily routines ,because it makes us better persons.
3.0	Recentlly, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debeat among people: people will spend less time cooking and preparing foods in twenty years than they do today.
3.0	some people claim that people will spend more or same time cooking and preparing foods in twenty years than they do today.
3.0	However, I would stand on their opposite side and I believe that people will spend less time cooking and preparing foods in twenty years than they do today.
10.0	My points can be seen as follows:
5.0	First of all, in twenty years, because of the development of ecnomic.
8.0	all people in the world will become more busy, so they will have less time to prepare food.
8.0	As we all know, the world's development is efficient, so people will spend more time to get money.
8.0	As a result, people will have less time to prepar food.
8.0	For example, in twenty years, the ecnomic is developed, people have to go to work early, and go home late.
8.0	If not, they would lose their work.
8.0	Maybe people will go home at night, so they have not enough time to cook and prepar foods, and they will eat easily.
5.0	What's more, in twenty years, with the development of world, more and more delicouse and nutrious food will be producted.
8.0	So it is not necessary to cook or prepar foods.
8.0	If there are a choice between cooking and quickly and delicouse food, I think all of us will choose the quickly food.
8.0	Becaues it can  achieve the same aim using less time.
8.0	For example, as we all konw, the inventment named quick noodles change world.
8.0	More and  more people will eat quick noodles, because it is delicouse and nutrious.
2.0	In a nutshell, I think in twenty years, people will spend less cooking and prepar food, because, it is saving time and people have not enough time.
3.0	In nowdays, customers begin to spend much money on the several physical things, such as elctronic devices, clothes and sneakers, which means the manufacture also need the skillful works to support that.
3.0	However, I don't think the workers can do many different types of tasks during the workday than when workers so similar tasks all say long.
12.0	So, I uses three specific points to support my ideas.
5.0	To begin with, different types of tasks would distract the workers' ability, which means they don't have enough time to regulate much things, even how skillful he is.
8.0	A psychological professor said that people cannot finish all tasks at one time.
8.0	For example,  my little brother who is a piramary students.
8.0	His parent have arranged that several tutorals to him for study the others skills, like the music instrument and dance and English.
8.0	His parent think that  the children will get successful to all subjects after the tutoral.
8.0	However, little brother  is be stressed and did not get any skills.
8.0	He explain that he cannot so manys thing during oneday and got so much pressure to his parent.
8.0	Obviously, it also can proves that worker  cannot do so many different tasks during the workday longer than do one task.
5.0	Secondly, peopel only can satisfy for one thing, they cannot recevie too much things, because our brain have not explored completely, which means we still are limited of ability.
8.0	For instance,  a worker only get a certal physical and mental energy to deal with the work.
8.0	I still remember a worker told me that he did not have enough energy to do two works in oneday, even he really needs double salary.
8.0	At firdt, he has tried do two works at workday, he told that could be a hostile feeling, he thinks that would makes be maddening and cannot satisfy.
8.0	In general, worker is imposible to do different tasks during workday that is longer than do one task.
7.0	Finaly, although some superman  can do different types of tasks during the workday and d
3.0	Certainly, we are now seeing many phenomenon like the students is choosing the better professor's course to learn more knowledge.
12.0	Also, parents are looking forward to making their children sucessful.
12.0	And the school are paying a lot of money to invite the better professors or teachers to come to teach the student.
11.0	All of these are revealing the fact that the teacher are being more appreacated in our society to us.
5.0	First, stuents are hoping to be taught by better professor in school.
8.0	Take myself for an example; every time the students need to choose the course for the next semester in my university, you can always find some professors' class is already full in the website, even so, the students are still trying hard to make their way to these classes.
8.0	I'm also one of the students, because if I want to find a good job for myself when I graduate, I must learn more knowledge which is of high quanity.
8.0	That's also the reason why so many students try their best to get this small chance.
8.0	That's what teachers mean to the students, so they are surely very significant and valued.
5.0	Secondly, parents prefer to make their children taught by better teachers and so teachers are important resorces in parents' eyes.
8.0	I have seen a couple of parents visit many organization to let their children take part of it.
8.0	Through some investigation, we can see that teachers are the factor that will influence parents' choice about choosing which school or which organization,; and the school which has good teachers is something that parents will pay any price to make their children join it.
8.0	Because the better teachers can teach the children better so the parents are willing to pay high slavary.
8.0	Some good teachers' salavary are as high as 100 dollars per hour.
8.0	Now, we can see that how teachers value among parents.
0.0	Last, some people say that teachers may be less appreciated in school since school provide them this job.
0.0	But on the opposite, schools are trying best to invite the best professr or teacher to join them because they are so attractive to parents and students.
0.0	One of my friends told me that when he was in the university, his professor was invented to another university in French because the professor taught well and the French university were willing to pay higher salavary.
7.0	That's why the teachers are important in sv
11.0	Nowadays, there is an increasing number of parents who offer thier children for their high grades.
11.0	My parents used to do such things in order to get my grades higher.
12.0	I'm under the impression that it's a good idea for parents to reward some money when children get good grades.
5.0	First of all, some reward encourages students to study much harder.
8.0	Their purpose could be more clear and easier to achieve.
8.0	Take my little brother for example, there was a short period when he had no incentive to study.
8.0	He got tired after always getting high grades instead of something else.
8.0	One day, my mother found that he had paid his attention to a series of toy robots for a long time and she thought of a solution that she would give my brother some money as long as he got grades which reached our ideal ones.
8.0	At that time, my brother felt himself more incentive.
8.0	He studied as hard as he used to be .
8.0	He hit himself to the books and finally,he got what he wanted.
5.0	Also, giving some money helps children become more self-discipline.
8.0	They could learn how to manage their money in a reasonable way and respect their parents at the smae time.
8.0	I cannot manage myself well when I was a sophomer in primary school.
8.0	I just handed in my assignment after my teacher reminded me many time and always lost my pin money as soon as my father gave me.
8.0	So my mother treated my with the strategy she also used for my brother.
8.0	I was able to get a portion of money if I performed well in each of my tests.
8.0	That portion of money would be the source of my pocket money.
8.0	Under this rule, I no longer lost my own money and developed a habit to study on my own.
1.0	In a nutshell, giving money for each high grade truly has a great impact on children's study life.
1.0	If parents and children all treat such thing in a right way,this will be beneficial for both of  us.
12.0	As far as I'm concerned, I' not for this kind of idea used by many parents.
12.0	There are a few reasons why I'm against it.
12.0	In my opinons, although receiving high grades can make parents satisfied and feel proud when talking it with other people, offering their children money may not be the proper way.
12.0	It can indeed encourage students to work harder in their studies, but it can mislead children to study for their parents but not themselves.
12.0	I think studying should be a motivated prosess and it's not linked with money.
12.0	Besides, offering too much money to children who are young and cannot spend it wisely might cause wastes or even worse effects.
6.0	I remember when I was a child in elementary school, some of my classmates' parent used this kind of strategy to encourage their children.
8.0	And for our school is one of the best among our district, the studying fees used to be high and most of my schoolmates came from wealthy families.
8.0	My deskmate was one of the example, for she was about a middle student in our class, her parents might offer she a lot of money if she once rank top 10 in our class.
8.0	She sometimes could won the prize but after she won it she would be too proud of herself and spent less time to study from then on.
8.0	What's worse?
8.0	She used most of the money to buy novels that were written on the websites which did no good wo our studies and became addicted in them.
8.0	There's no doubt tha she became even worse than she used to be before she won the prize.
7.0	She also made our teacher angry about her
11.0	I do think it is a good idea.
11.0	A reward may be a inspiring stuff.
11.0	Youth can be motivate by the thing they really like.
8.0	If your child is absurbed in a computer game, you can make a deal with your child.
8.0	For example, you can tell him or her that if they can get high grade, you will give him or her some money.
8.0	And then one day he or she can use it to buy a brand new computer.
8.0	So you can see, some thing which have bad influence on their study do have a bright side that can stimulate your child due to the reward.
6.0	Though school-age children won't have many chances to spend the money they were offered, they stiil have merchandise which they want to purchase.
8.0	And it is easy to satisfy a child.
8.0	They will certainly be pleased if their parents give them a reward.
8.0	No matter what the reward is.
8.0	And money may be the best choice.
8.0	They can use it to do everything they want, even if they want to donate it.
8.0	It is obvious a way that you can cultivate your child's ability on manage those money.
8.0	It sounds like a win-win.
8.0	Both benifit to their study and their social skills.
0.0	When I was a child, my parents always told me that they will offer me some money if I get high grades.
0.0	Though they will just give me a small sum of money, I was pretty motivated.
0.0	Becase I think it is also a way that shows I can make money through my diligence.
8.0	I never mind what I can buy with those limited money.
8.0	What I do mind is I finally have a goal.
8.0	Provide that my parents did not do that, my grades will be worse than now.
3.0	Do you like to watch movies or television?
3.0	Do you think they do negative effect on you?
12.0	I love movies because it expands my outlook.
11.0	And I do no think it do have more negative effects rather than positive effects on me behave.
11.0	Therefore, I agree that movies and television have more positive effects on young people behave.
12.0	There is a couple of reson
5.0	Initially, movies and television help people pay attention to their behave.
8.0	For instance, watching traditional English movies can make me take care of my gesture when I sit.
8.0	This is because people in the movies are gentle and elegant.
8.0	They sit as kings and queens and small like dolls.
8.0	Those beatiful women are attractive for us, and we'd like to follow them.
8.0	Hence, I think movies help us to reshape ourselves perfectly.
5.0	Moreover, television tells us how to distinguish ringht from wrong.
8.0	For example, shows in the television always illustrate that there is a people who has done many things from bad to good gradually.
8.0	In the process, television will tell us that deceiving friends is really bad that we will be alone at the end.
8.0	If people follow other bad people and do things that they think are right, they will be in hell, such as living in the prison forever or torturing by the monster.
8.0	Thereby, television let us know the consequence of bahaving bad and avoid doing it in our real lives.
2.0	Even though many parents think that children will be addicted to movies and television and  Taking account into all the factors mentioned above, we can safely arrive the conclusion that movies and television have much more positive effects on the way young people behave.
3.0	No, I reckon it is a bad idea.
3.0	First of all, studying is student's duty.
3.0	Parents can praise their children as they do well in the exam.
3.0	Also, they can provide children with money in some important exam.
8.0	For instances, they can offer money in the entrance high school exam.
8.0	This can give the children motivate of studying.
8.0	However, offer their school -age children money for each high grade is not suitable.
8.0	"This action can spoil the children and let them have the opinion of "" Money is easy to get."""
8.0	Even though it may let childen have a upward grade in a period of time, think of this circumstance.
8.0	If one day, the parents think the children is old enough to study themself and they stop giving money to the children while they have high grade, what will the children think?
8.0	First, confusing why mom do not give me money this time.
8.0	Second, be told that they won't give money this time.
8.0	Then?
8.0	Loss the motivate of study.
8.0	So, parents should think of the furture.
6.0	Second,do the student really need money?
9.0	If children really need something, they can just ask their parent's permission.
9.0	But with this kind of money, we can not predict how the children use the money.
10.0	So i do not
3.0	Nowadays ,many parents offer money to their children money for each high grade.
11.0	In my opinion,it is a good way to encourage their children to get good grade.
11.0	For the first part,doing so can give children inspiration .
11.0	For a child ,award and punishment is very significant,because they don't exactly know what is right thing or not.
8.0	But if you give him an award,he will continue doing this and later on he will realize what he do is a right thing.
8.0	To put it in another way,child don't know the importance of getting a good grade and as parents,you have the responsibility to tell him,at this time giving him money being a direct way to inspire him to keep his good grade.
8.0	After all,money is the most direct award for children.
5.0	For the second part,offering children money only when they get good grade can help them experience the difficulty of making money.
10.0	They have to work hard to get a good grade and keep it,so that they can get money from their parents.
5.0	For the third part,money is more practical than other awards.
9.0	Cildren can use money buy everything they want and do every thing they like,so money is useful to them in everytime.
9.0	If you buy a toy as an award but your child don't like it,it can't inspire your child to continue working hard and get a good grade.
7.0	Although giving money as an award is a good way ,it isn't always like thai
3.0	Nowadays, more and more parents give their shcool-age children money as an award  for each high grade .
3.0	Different peolple have different ideas about this common phenomnon.
12.0	Some peolple think it is a good idea because chlidren will gain the satisfication from this award.
12.0	However, others hold the opposed  viewpoint that it will spoil the children and be easy to make them pretentious and exaggerated.
10.0	In my humble view, parents should offer their children bonus for a payment of their hardworks.
6.0	To begin with, giving children bonus when they perform well in their test will motivate them and stimulate their interest in study.
8.0	I will take my idol Yan Ning, one of the greatest biology scientists in China, as an example to hold my viewpoint.
8.0	When Yan was a 7-year-old girl, she does not know any about the biology, nor was interested in it.
8.0	It was because her father  gave her a toy as a gift for her high garde in match test that she starts to work hard and was admitted to QingHua University after 1o years.
8.0	Although, her father does not give her money as an award, it is similiar to give money, which can motivate children.
11.0	Generally, I consider what these parents do to have more positive effects than negative ones.
11.0	In my opinion, In my opinion, it is more likely have a briefly beneficial impact on their children.
5.0	It is of great essesialty to be recognized at first that the purpose of these actions is to encourage their children to perform better at school.
8.0	The idea of encourage students by awards is by no means practical, as it has been commonly used and accepted all over the world.
8.0	The method is used throughout every period of one's growth, to which none of us has been unfamiliar.
8.0	In fact, the method was inherited from mother nature itself, as in revolution only ones with adaptable genes survive and that our brain encourage us with things like dopamines to create an encouraging feeling when you're doing things helpful to survival along with punishing us when it's harmful.
8.0	The methods of encouraging are proved to be effective.
5.0	However, the property of money being used as awards is controvesial.
8.0	Money varied itself from other commonly used awards like delicious foods or toys as money represent somthing unique in modern society.
8.0	Children at school are possibly not mature enough to be given such powerful things.
8.0	They haven't known the proper way to do with the money they have and it might stimulates them to form bad finacial habbits or even to spend them on dangerous fields.
7.0	To sum up, it is errorless to award children when they perform well at school, but the use of money must be cautious t
12.0	Nowadays, there are a lot of news about the hard-woring people's succeed in which we can find that many of them are helped by other people, such as their friend or some social people.
12.0	It seems that compared with past time, people are more willing to help those who use their hands and hard work to create the better future.
11.0	In my opinion, it is the truth and the reason why people like those struggling strangers is that helping them can make our society better, and eventually, the great society will also benefit everyone, including the people who help others.
5.0	The social class was always the problem in the developement of the human being, and there still is.
8.0	As we all know, only when people become the same rank can the problem be solved radically.
8.0	And when we see someone working really hard to change the life, they are essentially change their social class.
8.0	If people tend to help them to chenge their future, they will have more chance to push the society to develope, and the men who help them will also be benefited in those development.
8.0	On the other hand, there are still numorals of people who have the desire to change their life, helping some of them will give others a significant that everyone can be successful only if you working hard, and the country, the government, the public can always be with you which is really an ecoragement.
5.0	To personal, most people have the trend to help others, and prepare to the lazy people, everyone loves the man who are really struggling.
8.0	And the man who are helped will also tend to help someone like himself.
8.0	We all know that as the society develope, the number of the men like I have just said become growing fast.
8.0	And on the other hand, people also want to be helped when being poor, to help the struggling strangers can lead a great claim of society, which can also good for them.
2.0	So like I just said, whatever to the society or to personal, people now willing to help hard-working strangers, they tent to do this, and it is the good way to help the society develope.
12.0	Everyone should have their own privacy because we all have many secrets that we don't want anyone to know .
12.0	As the public people ,famous entertainers and athletes are always got concentrated by their fans who are fancinated about their private life .
12.0	Recently there is a discussion about whether famous entertainers and athletes deserve to have more privacy than they have now .
12.0	In my opinion ,I am in favor of the idea that they deserve to have more privacy .
10.0	Only protecting their privacy well ,they can work better .
6.0	First of all ,having more privacy can be effective to keep them from lots of trouble of their fans .
8.0	For instance ,if a movie star reveal his phonne number carelessly in some TV shows ,maybe he will change his number .
8.0	Because many people have known his number which means he is likely to be bothered by someone who always calls him delibrately .
8.0	It results in that he can't start his normal work .
3.0	When it comes to the issus whether it is more difficult to educating chilren today than past, perspectives vary from person to person.
12.0	Some people may argue that education children today is more difficult since students are facing many kinds of attract on the internet.
11.0	Nevertheless, as far as I am concerned, education in the past is a bigger challenge.
6.0	To begin with, online education in the recent years has plenty of resources which makes education more convenient than past.
8.0	With the development of technoly, people can upload mary educational materials and recording of classes on the internet.
8.0	If someone has a question about his study, he can search it one the phone immediately to solve it.
8.0	My mother told me when she was youny, it is very unconvient for her to solve a study problem.
8.0	If she had a question she can only solve it on her own by do through the book over and over again or wait until she saw her teachers then ask them.
8.0	Sometimes she may forget and ignoresome question
2.0	In a nutshell, from what have been mentioned above, we can conclude that nowadays educating children is easier than it was in the past.
3.0	Do you think between Internet access and public transportation, which one is more important?
3.0	And what's the advantages of the more essential one?
12.0	From my perspective, I think public transportation should be payed more attention and the government are supposed to spend more money on it.
4.0	Public transportation is an indispensible ingredient of our daily life and that's why it needs more regard.
8.0	From scientists' research, the increase of public transortation is the most serious problem in nowadays.
8.0	The example of shared bicycle is the best to illustrate this statement.
8.0	The amount of this kind of bicycles is just around the limitation and many roads for cars have also been dominated by this bicycles, which cause the traffic become more and more crowed and even exert detrimental influence on citizens' daily.
8.0	That's why government should spend money in employing more people to array the bicycles on the right place and advertise more people do not randomly the bicycles any more.
8.0	More than anything, having a harmonious can really increase this society and make it more succeed.
4.0	Although Internet access is also rapidly developing in today's society, the management on it will sometimes induce converse outcome, which means people will become more dependent on it and forget their own actual society.
8.0	Take myself, a girl who addicted to Internet a lot, as an instance.
8.0	Because of the convenient and effective function of Internet, I almost stay at home all the day and isolated from the outside world which is more meaningfull than the Internet.
8.0	In addition, the obcence information from the Internet have adversed effect on my purious mind.
8.0	All of these are due to the government's sumpyuous money help to the Internet access and I feel easier to touch the Internet to explore someting new in it which make me never outgoing and optimistic.
4.0	Compared with the outcome of getting money help from the government, it is obviously that improve public transportation will only lead to positive effects, but improve Internet access will both have nagetive and positive outcomes.
9.0	Thus, why not try to spend more money on the public transprotation, including the lack of buses, the speed of subway, the poisonous gas generated by cars and so on.
9.0	There are a bunch of problems of the public transportation, which is more important than the Internet access.
2.0	In summary, if  transportation issues can be solved, people will gain only good result and the spciety will develop much
3.0	The way of educaton do plays a vital role in students' performances, which is a truth especially in terms of the assignment toward students.
3.0	Some teachers prefer to let students do homework alone, believing ot will beneifts students more.
11.0	However, it is a desirable way, I think, for students to study collectively for several reasons.
5.0	First of all, when addressing homework in group, students are likely to cultivate their abilities related to academic and real life.
8.0	To be specfic, being confronted with difficulity, students are possible to question their partners for help, which means that they have to communicate with other in decent demand, as a reslult, it will enhance the ability of  interpersonal, directly related to futural study and career.
8.0	Besides, a cooperater, likely demanded in assigned project,  who is required with dealing with the arrangement of both group members and time controling.
8.0	In turn, such ability is highly demanded in today's job peformance.
8.0	Take me for example, it is the group assighment that push me to acquire the skills of being a leader.
8.0	In my first year on campus,  talking in front of  a vast of number of people scares me a lot, however, having been a leader in my assigned group allows me tons of chance to be a leader.
8.0	If  I were not participate in such group works, I would not have a chance to be the one today.
5.0	Morever,  it is a wise idea choice which contributes to effectiveness when it comes to assign projects.
9.0	In other words, dealing with tough tasks alone, student has to try hard but possible without any result, which us time-consuming, nevertheless, when students facing such difficulties collectively, they will sove it quickly since the group power.
9.0	So, compared with study alone, group study will be effictive.
2.0	In conslusion, owning to the benefits as cultivating abilities as well the effectiveness, it  benefits more for studnets to work together instead of study alone.
11.0	I believe this is a good method to encourage kids to learn and make progress.
12.0	When I was in middle school, my parents always promised me a gift after I achieved something.
12.0	Sometimes I got a high score or finished a goal they would give me reward.
8.0	Once I was in grade seven, and I did very bad in a certain test.
8.0	My father wanted to help me retrieve my confidence, so he made a deal with me that if I made it to the tenth in the rank or better, I would receive an outfit of NBA players wearing on the court which was worth nearly a thousand yuan.
8.0	And I was extremely excited, hoping to get the prize.
8.0	The following month I was more hardworking, trying to learn well, and the result was really a surprise: I was just the tenth in class.
8.0	Consequently, I received my gift and I learnt that I should be more diligent and more devoted in study.
8.0	Only if I did in this way would I get my gifts.
6.0	Actually,  one negative factor is that parents may give their children money or gifts too easily.
8.0	If a kid can acquire a precious gifts or a large amount of money by simply achieve some easy goals, it will be really difficult for him or her to know good things require diligency and devotion.
8.0	No one living on this planet can simply get something without paying.
8.0	There is a saying goes no pain,no gain.
8.0	Parents must let their kids know the principle.
1.0	Another negative factor is that parents purchase very expensive gifts for their kids or directly give them a large amount of money as reward.
1.0	I affirm parents may cause kids to show off among people around them like teachers and classmates, thus leading to robberies or thefts.
9.0	We know that thrifty is a good virtue.
9.0	Therefore, I still hold the perspective that offering gifts or money is a good idea,as long as they don't go too far.
3.0	Many peopel would say that getting to know events happening around the world is useless for people because it is just wasting time that can have a better use.
3.0	After all, I usually spend several hours reading some amusing news about movie stars.
11.0	However, in my opinion, it is crucial to know about events even though they are unlikely affect our daily life.
5.0	Firstly, people can get satisfection by reading news about the world.
8.0	News about the world are usually something that can't happen in our daily life.
8.0	By reading these news, some interesting events can amuse people.
8.0	For example, I usually scan the news about my favorite movie star, Robert Downey.
8.0	Every time I read that he was acting a new character, I feel happy and can't not wait to see the movie soon.
8.0	I always get amused by the interesting events happening ih the movie set.
8.0	Although I will not take movies like Downey, I get satisfaction by reading about it.
5.0	Furthermore, knowing about the events happening around the world can broaden the horizons.
8.0	Different coutries have different traditions, by knowing about the special events happening in theses countries can surely get to know the outer countries well.
8.0	Only by knowing about the outer world and others' improvements, can people improve themselvs.
8.0	This situation can be proven by that alteration in government policies and innovation in educational system.
8.0	Especailly in the first education reform in the America history, the Soviet Union launched a new satelite which made America put the education reform into practice.
8.0	The launch of satelite has no effect on the daily life of American people, but the news motivate people to catch the pace of the Soviet Union.
8.0	It is knowing about the events about the world that change the entire education system of America.
10.0	Admittedly, knowing t
3.0	Preference in menthods of relaxation varies from person to person.
3.0	Among these menthods, staying indoors and reading or watching a movie is more popular than going outside and doing exercise.
12.0	As fou me, I prefer relaxing by reading a book and watching a movie.
5.0	Reading books or watching movies helps me relax physically.
8.0	I am busy for my whole day with fishing all my work, commuting to my office on the other side of the city, and doing household chores that I do not have much time or energy to exercise.
8.0	However, reading a book or watching a movie helps me slow down and enjoyable.
8.0	For example, when I read or watch a movie, I can sit back on the sofa and lie on my soft bed.
8.0	In this way, my muscles can rest.
8.0	On the other hand, when I exercise, I in no case rest or relax my body.
8.0	In addition, I have to add washing my sport clothes because of exercising.
5.0	Reading books and watching movies also helps me relax mentally, To tedious meetings, repeated routines and limited new tasks of my job makes me exhausted.
9.0	At these moments I like to enjoy an interesting story from a book or a film.
9.0	Then, all of the disturbing feelings, like boredom and depression, go away and I come away felling inspired.
2.0	Admittedly, exercising can help us relax to some degree.
7.0	Football matches with co-wokers, playing badminton in the backyard with family , and even a basketball
3.0	Nowadays, the universities begain to focus on the other aspects such as sports and social activities, because more and more peoplr think it is as important as studying.
11.0	And I think it is a good tendency, participating these activities, we can release pressure, make more friends, and become more confident.
5.0	First, students can relax through this way.
8.0	In school, students have got to face different pressure, such as the homework, test, paper, ect.
8.0	If they stay this environment for a long time, they will feel tired and depression, so they need something to release it.
8.0	For instance, in the past time, I was preparing the final exam.
8.0	Because I am so nervous, I cannot eat well, and I usually stay up late because I am worry about my grades.
8.0	This situation keep a long time, one day, I have a cold, even I drank the medicine, my sick still cannot be cure and I told this thing to my friends.
8.0	My friend thinks the reason is I under too much pressure, and she suggested me to play some sports, so in her spare time, she invited me to play tennis with her.
8.0	After the sports, I found my spirit become better, and my cold seems like be cure.
8.0	In the end, I can continue the reviewing with a good conditions.
8.0	So I think sports is important.
5.0	Second, it is beneficial for us to extend our circle of friends.
8.0	In school, everyone is busy with their own business, so it is hard for them to save time to make friends, and this is a good chance for them.
8.0	For example, I cannot establish the relationship with others instantly, so I do not have many friends.
8.0	And one day, my school establish a English club, and I am interested in the English very, so I join it.
8.0	At first, I was worry about how to get along with them.
8.0	But when I came into it, I found everyone is friendly, and most of them have the same hobby like me, so I talk with them well.
8.0	After that, I am not afraid of talking with other people, and I own a lot of friends.
1.0	Finally, we can become more cinfidient because this activity.
1.0	For example, my friend is a shy girl, and when she meet some troubles, she does not know how to deal with it.
7.0	But this situation has changed, after she take
3.0	Obviously, nowadays, every children will possess their own cellphone even more a computer.
3.0	However, after such noticable technological changes, does these children become more creative, or shiftless?
11.0	As for me, I think that those advanced techonoly migh have more negtive effects for the children.
5.0	Admittidly, thanks for the amazing technology, our life ge more colorful.
9.0	While we driving, we can listen the music channles which can release our life strains, when we have a big program of reache paper, we just need to type the key words on Internet and click botthon, then the large amount of knowledge come out; when we travle in a new city, we can book the hotel online.
9.0	As you can see, the technology indeed develope the quality in our daily life.
5.0	However, comparing with the effective information, there are more somrthing that wast our precious time and we actually do not need.
8.0	The large number of useless information is like a boom which fullfils the children's life and makes them think passively.
8.0	For instance, when they want to check some acdemic term online, behead the truth website, there are a lot of computer games advertisments.
8.0	Instead of continuing to rearch, the children who has less the ability of self-control will be attracted and turn to play these computer games.
8.0	Without studying, thier inviting ability will decline.
2.0	Futhermore, the arctical intelligant migh replace the process of thinking for children.
10.0	Because these smart APP has simpified the thinking process, so in result, as time goes by, it might make children less creative.
7.0	For example, if a
11.0	In my opinion, i agree this good point.
12.0	Parents should give their children money as a reward for getting high mark in school.
11.0	Firstly,more and more treat education  more important by nowdays.
12.0	Just like parents create some new methods to imitates their children.
12.0	Recently, the phenomena that parents give their children money as a rewards for getting high mark in school, this can cause wide public concern.
12.0	On the contrary, i contend that give money to children as a reward is a good choice, a choice that its mertis weigh out its drawbacks.
5.0	secondly,when children get feedback of hard work by themselves.
8.0	The study will become a happy job instead of this duty, that is really boring.
8.0	Just doing a lot of exercises,working out subjects problems and so on.
8.0	So sitting a goal for children is necessary for the children to keep their interests.
5.0	Thirdly, thinking of financial is an important ability, that is useful to the morden people.
8.0	During the method that gaving money as a reward, children will have a chance to manager the money.
8.0	Parents will benefit their children not only to current life.
8.0	However ,for their future.
1.0	All in all, it is unwise to guve mush money once time when children get a good mark,since that the children will seek only for money during their study.
1.0	The goal expect is encouraging the children and telling them to pursue more success.
3.0	The advertisement fill with poeple's every life--- on the newspaper, in the television, on the bas station and so on.
3.0	All of them are so attractive that attempt people to buy them.
11.0	In my opinion, most advertisements mkae products seem much better than they really are.
5.0	Initially, the advertisements satify the poeple's imagination of products.
8.0	Most of advertisements are corelated to the genre of the products.
8.0	For example, the pizza in the advertisement always seem to be delicious; the car in the advertisement seem to be delicate...
8.0	I remember once I bought a chocolate bar the advertisement in the television is so appealing.
8.0	The chocolate coverd nuts and inside the bar is liquid coco milk.
8.0	Therefore, I could not wait going the shop and bought one which was disappointed to me,because there was no difference with other chocolate.
8.0	Undoubtly, the advertisement is a strategy of the company.
5.0	In addition, the advertisements strategically concentrate on their target population.
8.0	Not all the products can satify all people, so the companies will focus on the potential consumers who need the product or just want to buy it.
8.0	This is a common phenomenon in the society.
8.0	Many companies are willing to hire famous celebrities as spokemen to advertise their products, and espectially all these people have a large number of fans.
8.0	Thus, as the advertisement launched, the purchasing quantity of the products will increase.
8.0	Also, the important is , the fans will partially ignore the essence of the product and only for their idols.
2.0	In my conclusion, there's multiple and diverse to advirtise the companies' products, so more and more careless to the products really are.
11.0	I disagree with this statement, mainly because of many current affairs that showed the public apathy.
12.0	The reason of my disgreement is shown as follow:   Firstly, Although the development of Internet was convinent of people's life, the terrible impact on people's behavior can't be neglected.
12.0	The reliance of Internet fixes our steps at home, and less contraction to the society is common in various ages.
12.0	People's circle of friendship is not definitely expanded in this state, which potenially make people abnormal mentally.
10.0	Loneliness and indifference are fulled with the society.
6.0	Secondly, lack of trust is common in our society nowaday, especially among strangers, which results from blankmail in all aspects of life.
8.0	Car crash usually predictablely happend.
8.0	The victim in the accident may deliberately move to the front of the car when it is being drived.
8.0	The kind of people tend to lead to a accident to obtain ilegel benefit, which the atomsphere of society is unfriendly.
12.0	I disagree with watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.
8.0	Because, when people do physical exercise, the people's mind could be strain and also include body such as muscles,waist,shoulder,etc.in the case of this mind, I do not think the people can have extra vigor to thinking, to imagine a book like a novel or a movie.
8.0	Although the people according eyes can get  projection in their brain by what they saw, but the people have no time to reflect on a movie or a book, the mind would be uptight, there is no more space to save what you saw.
8.0	As result, whatever a book or a movie, the people can not get anything from eyes.
8.0	on the other hands, sometimes the people doing physical exercise with their goals; such as lose weight, exercise on muscle or exercise on muscle of one part of body.
8.0	In this stauts,  if is me, there is no time to let me watching a movie to relax myself, it is waste my time and it could not help me lose weight.
8.0	So if the people want to  However, the ears are working that one way for help people to collect information and it is more simpler to get information than eyes.
8.0	in other words, the people could listen what they hear from a book or a movie even though the information less than eyes got.
11.0	I agree with this idea.
12.0	i think parent could offer their children money if their children get good grade in study.
12.0	Although the money they gaven to there children might distract they children.
8.0	And make their children spend more time to think about how to spent this money and how to make more money.
8.0	But it truely encourage student to spend more time to think about how to improve their grade and gain from their hard work.
8.0	If the student do not get higher grade he would not resive the money their want to get and put more time back to study.
5.0	Second,This money will help student develop a early sence of money.
8.0	One of my friends who's parents alway offer him money becaus of his high grade always spend more time on study than us.
8.0	And he cares more about his parents.
8.0	He always talk about the time when he get money from his parents.
8.0	I remember he work very hard at school and always get grade much better than i did>So I believe the chilre  who were given money because of good grade will develop better sence of money and will achieve more on thier further stud.
5.0	Finally,It won't spend alot to give their chilren money if they get good grade.
8.0	If parents spend money as a reward.
8.0	thier children will understand how hard it is for their parents to make money and they parent do not need to give thier student more money to buy the goods their chilren wants to buy.
8.0	Their can gain back money buy their self.
8.0	and that fose chilren to spend to on study but not their parents forces they to study hard.
8.0	and that will reduce the pressture on their parents.
12.0	Nowadays, whether the old should keep learning new things as the young do has aroused intense debate among the public.
11.0	Some people argue that it is still important for older people to learn new things; however, in my opinion, learning becomes less important when people grows older.
5.0	To begin with, it is hard and ineffective for older people to learn new things.
8.0	When people grow older, they gradually lose the ability of learning, because their brians are not as effective as the young.
8.0	And since they have already learned a lot in their lives, they tend to form stereotype that keeps them from accepting new things.
8.0	So even if we force the old to learn new things, they may be much less effective than the young.
8.0	It will be better for them to keep   using the old ways.
8.0	For example, my grandmother has lives for her whole life without phones, and even though the phones are widely use today, she cannot understand its usage and advantages.
8.0	She thinks its useless, even though we finally persuade her to learn to use it, she just cannot memorize the ways of using the phones.
8.0	It will be more easier for her to find us direcly instead of trying to contact us with phones.
8.0	However, my cousin has no trouble learning to use the phones and he even knows more than me now.
8.0	The low efficiency for the old to learn new things makes it less important for them to learn new things.
5.0	In addition,  it is more important for the old to teach rather than to learn.
8.0	The old have much more experiences than the young.
8.0	When people grow older, what they should consider is the development of the next generation and pass their experiences to the young in order to guide them.
8.0	The new things should be learned by the young but not the old, since the one who will support the whole society in the future is the young.
8.0	For example, the great scientist Feyman focused his time on education for students rather than his own reseach when he was old.
8.0	Because he knew that he can never make a breakthrough in science, but he can pass his knowledge to the next generation and they will definately finish his work one day.
1.0	To sum up, it is less important for the old to learn new things than the young.
1.0	In contrast, what really important for them is to pass their knowledge and help the development of the next generation.
11.0	I disagree with the think of watching a movie or reading a book is better than doing physical exercise to realx.
4.0	For the first thing we should consider is why do we need to relax?
8.0	The pressure of work, the long time to study or too much talking of girlfriend and parents.
8.0	That's all about tired in mental.
8.0	So if we are prepared to relax ourselves completly, why do not we chose the things we do not need to think at all.
8.0	"For example, when you studied foa the whole day and got back home, you might think that ""Keep the books away"" but not a book to entertain yourself."
4.0	The second reason is that exercise is good for our body.
8.0	But the useful book or the TV program is not chosen to relax.
8.0	So the entertain program or the book is not do any good things for our body, and also make our eyes less clear than before.
8.0	In the years during my senior high school, I always play basketball for relax but not watching the boring programs.
8.0	That is really a waste of time.
4.0	The last but not the least,  exercise is more like a hobby.
8.0	We will find we love sports when we really do it.
8.0	The soap opera is a good method to kill the time, but not relax.
8.0	Maybe it is a good hobby for the lazies.
8.0	I think the hobby make scenses for our relax.
8.0	During sports, we will meet many other people with the same hobbies and we can play games togethers, which is a more fun thing to do than being alone with a television.
0.0	For the reasons above, I think doing physical exercise is a better way to realx.
0.0	Why not find the better method to make your home life full.
0.0	Keep away from your television and doing exercises with us, you will find a different life with before.
11.0	Yes,I agree.
11.0	I think it's neccessary for parents to let their children make mistakes.
4.0	Firstly, everybody is born imperfect, making mistakes is more than common in our daily life.
4.0	Secondly, as a saying goes, practice makes perfect.
8.0	Here I would like to see this saying as an exellent sentense to attach importance to DIY.
8.0	As we all know, nearly every great discovery in science and technology are based on experiments, most of which proved unsuccessful.
8.0	Only when you have the courage to make mistakes or fail can you find the best solution at last.
8.0	And that should be what parents teach their children.
4.0	Thirdly, learning from one's own mistakes is usually far more impressive than learning from the text books or from other's experiences.
9.0	American president Franklin once cut off a precious peach tree in his garden when young, but his dad did not criticise him very severely, instead he made this mistake a really meaningful lesson for young Franklin.
9.0	Franklin's father's wise education eventually made Franklin a great president in American history.
4.0	Forthly, children have the right to taste the love forgiveness when they are young, which could help them develope into a kind and tolerant person when they grow up.
9.0	If a person is often beaten by his or her parent in his or her childhood, he or she might be as cruel and kindless to others when he or she grows up.
9.0	On the contrary, if one is treated with love and forgiveness, the chances that he or she should become a lovable person will certainly increase considerably.
1.0	in a word, everyone make mistakes, parents should let their children make mistakes as long as they don't break the principle or the law.
1.0	A really great person is not the one who never make mistakes, instead , great persons make a lot of mistakes before they correct them again and again, which parents should realize.
12.0	When we talk about the parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade, some people hold same positin as the statement that they think it is a good way for students to keep up and learn harder.
12.0	However, I partially agree with thier view points.
12.0	From my perspective, parents offer their children money for each high grade is bad, becuase children may doing somthing to get money, such as cheating, find answers on the internet.
4.0	At the beggining, offering money for children with high grade accounts for worse encouragement to children.
8.0	Actually.
8.0	some students prefer the money, but they cannot get the high score they would trying to cheat when they have a test instead learn something by themselves.
8.0	while some students they can get high score, but they still want the money, so they lean harder but they have less physical excises, so their body become worse at last they even can't to go to the school, and parents spend much more money than it should be.
4.0	Secondly, from  students aspect, they need to work harder than before, maybe they can get the money becuase of their high grade but they can't have fun or even relax themselves like before; From parents aspect, children may become greedy when they get the money from the first time, they would have more appetite to ask for more money, but in some poor family they can't afford it, if they don't give the money to children and their children would not trust their parents anymore or even don't want to study; From teacher's aspect, study meant to let students become knowledgable instead of money, for them giving the money to children is not the best idea.
4.0	In admitteddly, there are some people hold opposing view points that if parents don't offer their children with money is bad, children maybe would not have power to study.
9.0	Although i partcially agree with this statement, but i think parents could take them out, like to go to the museum or the park as the reward instead  of the money.
9.0	so this so called problem is not a problem.
2.0	In conclusion, I particially agree with the statement, but I also think parents give the money to the children who get good grade is bad with two reasons this is cannot essentially encourage students to get higher score, and for different people they have different reason for it.
3.0	In nowadays, people get richer, and the quiety of life improve a lot.
3.0	Parents always devote themselves for their children and give all the things they want.
3.0	in that case, most of parents offer their children for high grade when they get in the school.
3.0	Undoubt it is the way to show how they care about thier children in China,and it is a way to cheer up child studying.
3.0	However, as far as I corncen, it is a trouble care for their children.
12.0	Not only it give child chance to waste money, but also change the main meaning of studying.
5.0	Money is always a bad thing to let child become a bad student.
8.0	For having high mark, children can buy lots of tools which they want.
8.0	Sometimes, it will make a great hameful influence for students.
8.0	For my experience, I used to waste my money to buy a gameboy that is a kind of machine to play game.
8.0	It has costed a great number of money.
8.0	And I played it the whole day, no matter day and night, on class or after class.
8.0	It really take a lot of my time in it.
8.0	So if a child have high grade and get money, it might be a beginning tbe worse.
8.0	Afterall, child has a weak power to control thenselves.
5.0	On the other hand, to reward child is just a way that only can work for a short time.
8.0	In this way, children are easy to love with the money ruther than the studying.
8.0	And it will soon be exchange by other things, shuch as the computer game.
8.0	So in this way, it is harder to let child like the studying, and just fail in love with the moeny.
8.0	Otherwise, this way sometimes will exchange the force on the gift, and effect student.
2.0	All the words, to offer the money to children when they grt high grade might cause a great tourble.
3.0	When asked about the problem of how to learn about a person, people usually exhibit an air of uncertainty.
11.0	Some people claim that we can understand a person by the books andmovies that this person like, while others disagree with thiis statement.
11.0	As far as I'm concerned, I tend to agree with this statement.
5.0	Firstly, charecteristics of a person can be learned through the feature of the books or movies rhat this person like.
8.0	Since it is obvious that if a person like a book, there certainly are some characters in the book who have similar charecteristics with thiis people.
8.0	Result from there s a mutual attection between the two individuals who have same characterstics, which lead us understand this people by the book that he love.
8.0	For example, if a person tend to read love stories, predictably, we can guess the person is a romantic people.
8.0	On the other hand, if a war movie is favoured by this person, to some extent, the person is a passionate people.
5.0	Secondly, the books and movies that the person love is a reflection of educational level and personal quality of the person.
8.0	Thiis is because the experiences of a person undergoing determine what the people like.
8.0	For instance,  a person belongs to the upper middle class.
8.0	It is apparently that he wll like to read or see some literary works rather than vulgar contents.
8.0	And t is unreasonable that a person who just graduated from a junior school wiill appreciate the worth of abstract book.
10.0	Taking these factors into account
12.0	With the fostering of the technology of the corresponding, we can easily get the information of the abroad events from the by lots of ways.
11.0	Some people think it has no means that we know the events happening around the world.
12.0	However, I totally disaree with this point since the worthy of the events all over the world which is seemingly not connected with us is unpredicted.
5.0	In the first place, we can get more appealing inspiration of the events which flows from outer world.
8.0	My own experience successively illustrates this viewpoint.
8.0	I always read the scientific events news, which can not affect my daily life including the time to get up and my favorite sports.
8.0	Unbelivebaly, knowing the scientific creation happening around the world  let me know more up-to-date techniques which can improve the operating efficiency of the telephone.
8.0	In this way, I specialize on this direction.
8.0	Finally, I combine this kind of highly efficient operating device with my phone,which even help me to patent this new evention.
8.0	To be honest, in the past I never image that these kind of technology events can benefite me.
8.0	And now knowing about events around the world is so important for me.
5.0	Futuremore, we can avoid some devastation by knowing events happending outworld.
8.0	It is known to all that we can access the the practice of one gorvenmental solution or economic strategy by asserting from the events which come from around the world.
8.0	A generally- accepted fact that we should learn a lot of historical events or the influential events all over the world even that seemingly has not connection with our daily life.
8.0	The fact is that these events are priceless for us.
8.0	These events like the mirror that can reflecting the shortcomming and advances of one strategy in a real event.
8.0	This is why we need to deeply do some research on these events.
0.0	To sum up, it is rediculous to ignore the outworld events.
0.0	We can have more precaution and get some magical inspiration from that.
0.0	Thus, let us shift more atterntion on these events from the boring recreation.
3.0	Never before in the history has the problem of education been such salient than today.
3.0	Since people treat education much more important, parents are likely to create some new methods to encourage their children to become more passionate about study.
3.0	Rencently, the phenomenon that parents give their children money as a reward for getting high mark in school has caused wide public concern.
11.0	Some people indicate that it will change children's opinion on study, making them believe only money is the purpose of study.
12.0	However, I contend that giving some money to children as a reward is agood choice, a choice that its merits weigh out its drawbacks.
5.0	To start with, giving money to the children as a reward can stimulate children to study harder.
8.0	When children get feedback of their hard work, the study will become a happy job instead of just a boring duty.
8.0	We cannot refute that sometimes study could be really boring, doing a lot of exercises, reading passages, working out math prombles.
8.0	So setting a goal for children is necessary for the children to keep their interests.
8.0	If they could use the money to buy what they want as a gift, children will pursue the good mark harder.
5.0	Another reason drives me to indicate is that finacial thinking as an important ability which is useful to the modern people,meaning that we need to teach our children how to manage their own money.
9.0	During the method taht giving money as a reward, children will have a chance to manage their own money.
9.0	Parents will benefit children not only to their current life but also to their future.
0.0	Admittedly, it is unwise to give much money once a time when children get a good mark, since that children will seek only for money during their study.
0.0	The goal we expect is to encourage our children and tell them to pursue more success.
0.0	However, if we make sure that children will not misunderstand the meaning of the reward and keep a healthy attitude to the money, it will be fine to do so.
12.0	Recently, an interesting topic has aroused a heated debate: whether or not it is important for old people to learn new things like the youngers do.
12.0	The answers vary from person to person.
11.0	From my perspective, i suppose this statement that elder people also should study or learn new things in their life.
5.0	To begin with, learning new things prevent them from being left behind by the society.
8.0	As we know, with the increasing development of technology, especially the smart phone, most of people rely on their smart phone to communicate online.
8.0	Under this case, if elder people are willing to learn how to use the smart phone and how to chat online, they are more likely to close the relationship between relatives, such as their grandchildren.
8.0	For example, my grandpa bought a smart phone online last year and she asked me to teach her the way to use Wechat, an application for chat online.
8.0	Later,my grandpa always talked with me by using this app without paying any extra money; and I found he is so cute and hunmorous that I have never noticed before.
8.0	Without using Wechat, i would  never form new perspective to my grandpa and much more like him.
5.0	Furthermore, the new things they have learned can be regarded as an entertainment to kill the boring time in their life.
8.0	This is because most old people are retaired for many years and their recreation life is limited by their health condition.
8.0	According to the survey, most of old people feel extremelly bored.
8.0	In this case, if they may well to learn the new skills or new games, such as photograghy and chesse, their life must be more colorful and energetic.
8.0	To illustrate, my neigbourhood was a retired people for several years and he learned to take photos by cell phone accidentially.
8.0	He are crazy into taking photos to landscape.
8.0	In that way, he also learn to take a good photos  on the internet and borrow some intro books in the library.
8.0	To some extent, photography makes his life more meaningful rather than boring.
1.0	To sum up, it is advisable for old people to study new things as the way as younger people.
1.0	This is because it can exclude old people from being left behind and allow them to enjoy their life again, which is also beneficial to their children to stop worrying about them.
3.0	Do you think it is more important for governemnts to spend money to improve intrtnet access than to improve public transportation?
12.0	I disagree with that, if governments to spend money to improve public transportation, it can make less pollution, less trafact and spen less money.
5.0	Now day car can make a lot of pollution for the earth, if government spend money to buy more public bycial and buy more bus, then the people don't need to drive their own car, the car start to decreas, so it can make less pullotion.
8.0	For an exsample bus can have 30 or more people inside but car just can have 7 people inside.
8.0	ir can get less pullotion,   In Chine travfact is a normal thing can see every day, if government built more train and bus, we don't need to see the travfact anymore.
8.0	Becuase people start to go to by a train or a bus the car get less, and it can get more safety too, many people are pass away by travfact.
5.0	Many people didn't have money to buy a car, it is very expensive, but if they buy a tickes for train or but it was very chip,the people not't need to use a alot of money.
2.0	I think government need to spend more money for the public transportation, so it can slove three very improtant things with the pullotion, travfact and monry.
12.0	Recently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people: whether it is better for colleagues or classmates to communicate in person than through emails in order to do a project?
12.0	Some claims that using emails is more convenient.
12.0	However, I believe that communicate in person is better.
6.0	To begin with, communicating in person can help deal with the problems people meet in the project.
8.0	If people find some difficults when they are doing a project, communicating in person can sooner brainstorm to solve the problems.
8.0	This is because people can show their opinions or oppose others opinions immediately and the collision of views can create the best solution to the problems.
8.0	On the contrary, if people just.
8.0	send emails to talke about the problems, they would not have any collision of views since writing emails need time and it is hard for people to write the emails to show their opinion and oppose others opionion at the same time.
8.0	Finally, they might not solve any problems.
8.0	For example, I and my friends were planing to hold a party in order to celebrate Christmas.
8.0	At first, each of us focus on one aspect of the projects and send emails to discuss the problems we met.
8.0	However, I found it is just waste of time because I received several solution of my problems but I do not know which is the best.
8.0	Thus, we decided to communicate in persons.
7.0	Then, each of us can show our opinion about one problems and find the best solution of that
3.0	Recent years witnessed the debate between working together and working alone .
3.0	While most people think the cooperation will be better.
3.0	From my perspective, the advantages of woking alone outweighs the group work for following reasons.
4.0	First,working alone will be more familiar to us .
8.0	Since most of the assignment is finished by ourselves, we may feel uncomfortable when discussing something with others.
8.0	And we will be more efficient because we get used of the styles of ourselves.
8.0	For instance, our class was asked to prepare a presentation and I decided to do it with my classmates.
8.0	While some of other people worked alone.
8.0	And the results show that students who did by themselves spend less time than our group.
4.0	Then, woking with others means more distractions.
8.0	Every student in a group may has different opinion ,and we are easily influenced by others.
8.0	Also it may cause argument in the group, which will severely affect the efficiency and the friendship between them.
8.0	The same example, we had different ideas about the title of the presentation and argued for hours.
8.0	But it was just a small part of our task.
8.0	So it turns out that the debate is absolutely a waste of time.
4.0	Last but not least, the person who can trust is youself.
8.0	Some of the parteners may be not reliable at all.
8.0	In a group ,the task will always distributed to each teammate.
8.0	And it is common that someone forget it or do not complete it before the deadline,which may destory the whole group's work.
2.0	Based on what is discussed above, I undoubtly suggest to work alone.
10.0	And
3.0	How to choose a job career is always a challenging question as the young are serious about their future at the threshold of their adulthood.
11.0	To follow the parents' pathway or to lead the way that has never been travelled, that is a personal question, since everyone has his/her preference.
11.0	As for me, i would like to choose the jobs that are different from my parents' in thinking of the knowledge that i want to gain and the life experience that i desire to acquire.
5.0	First and formost, choosing a job that is different from my parents' enables me to gain the knowledge of the field that my parents have never stepped into.
9.0	By doing a different job, I have the freedom to learn what is needed in my work and thus will not be interfered by parents.
9.0	Additionally, I can also be more concentrated on the problems in the work and learn what i really need, thus dealing with the problems and gaining the knowledge through practical work.
5.0	What's more, doing different jobs from parents' can provide me with a broader perspective.
9.0	When doing a different job, i must learn from the people whom I am not familiar with.
9.0	By interacting with different people from circles that are not my parents old quentences, i have the access to broaden by perspective, which can definitely enrich my life experience.
2.0	On the other hand, it may be beneficial for us to choose the job that is similiar to our parents' in consederation of their experience in the field, the resources they have
11.0	In my opinion,that is not a good idea to offer money for children who get high grade in school.
12.0	Because it will make children think that they just need to get good grade and the can get paid.
12.0	Even sometimes they may cheat in the test just for getting high grade.
12.0	Parents can give praise to children but not money.
11.0	Children is too young to handle this money.
10.0	They may waste money to buy something they don't really need and think it is easy to earn money.
6.0	Nowadays,we can often see news from internet that parents spoil their children so that children become selfless.
8.0	They just care about themself.
8.0	It is not good for their growing up.
8.0	When they go to work,they will not get paid just for they do sonmething they should do.
8.0	Maybe they will feel confused why the boss do not give me money.
8.0	But the fact is fact,we can not change it.
0.0	I think parents should take this chance with children to play together.
0.0	Give them a dayoff,have a family holiday.
0.0	That will be more benefit for children's live.
12.0	Nowsdays,more and more people can help the struggling strangers but some do not willing to help them because they think it is unnecessary trouble, and there are plenty of examples to prove it.
8.0	nut i argee people are moer willing to help the struggling strangers in today                                                                                                                                                                       first humans are in a better state than before,so many people hane more energy and time to help those in need .
8.0	like the creation of larger cahrities and councils.
8.0	there are lienty of things to be done to protect the rights of the poor .
8.0	as a result , the nuber of houses for people in diffculty shouid be much higher than before                                                                               sound is not just the goveernment that has a lot of these kinds of measures,but it is also the private sedtor than has of these knds of people that are passionate about these kinds of things ,and getting younger and youager,l and young people arewilling to take these kinds of jobs, to protect other people ,to protect their human rights to pritect them form bullying.
8.0	third because now people will be mire indepenndent and willing to help these poor people , because it can also exercise their own  will to make their own extracurricular life or work life more fulfilling                                                                                                     in a word i think people are moe willing to help lonr=ely people now than in the paet, besause they have better conditions and more time
3.0	Is the era of our grandparents beatific?
3.0	Is it more fortunate for us in nowadays society?
3.0	With the technological development, there are increasing number of recreational facilities appear, and various type of the transportation occur, my life is more satisfied and convenient.
3.0	As a result, from my perspective, the life today is better than it was several decades ago.
5.0	On the one hand, the development of technology renders the life splendid.
8.0	To be more convincible, a large number of electronic devices were invented, like the cellular phone, MP5, Pad and so on.
8.0	All of them can enrich the leisure, but when our grandparents were children, everything was dissimilar.
8.0	"There are no better illustration to prove this point than the instance of my grandfather, everytimes he watch me when I enjoy the happiness of the video games, he says""when I was a child, I did not has anything to play, just managing my farm and do some sport, its quite tired and boring to tears！"""
8.0	Obviously, it is fortunate for me to born in the contemporary society, since I can enjoy the sophisticated equipment that can make me joyful.
5.0	On the other hand, the development of transportation renders our life easier and convenient.
8.0	To be more specific, several decades ago, when we intended to go somewhere, we can only go there by foot or the older bicycles.
8.0	However, in the nowadays society, we can do it by car or the airplant wherever.
8.0	For instance, when my grandmother was a child, she must take bike to the destination that was 10 kilometres far for her about 8 hours.
8.0	However, when I what to go a place that 100 kilometres far for me, I just take car by only one hours.
8.0	So nowadays societ is more convenient.
7.0	Obviously, the transportation also enables us to be more eas
12.0	As the development of education and economy,should parents dffer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school or not is become the topic hotpot os masses.
11.0	In my opinion,I support the perspective that they should offer money for their children's study.
11.0	To illastrate my point,I have three reasons.
5.0	Firstly,because of the diffrifence of kid's IQ or teacher's level, there aren't all of the children can award signifikent education.
9.0	So study in school can't promise all of the study quility of childrens.
9.0	To tackle these problem,use money to achieve educate quality outside is tremendous necessary and important.
5.0	Secondly,In the past year,compatation in the world is more and more difficult.
8.0	And get a better score is become a important way to show these kids in the future.
8.0	And if these parents can ues more money to afford some class,they maybe can get the higher grade in the school's exam.
8.0	A reasearch score showed us :these kids are better than the other about 20 percent who hade these earn class.
8.0	It can lead them to achieve the offers of better highschool or university than these kid never have earn paid class.
8.0	It is better for the future’s success.
0.0	last but not least,when this kids having these class or get higher mark in their school.
0.0	They can make more friends who are equaliy great with them.
0.0	And they will teach each other,and help each other in the fucher.
0.0	Just like USA present senior Bush,his success can't with out his great friend Hebaote .
0.0	they are meet themthelves when their study.
3.0	Some families have a sort of rule betweeen parents and children that parents will award childen with money gor their high grade in school.
3.0	Many people especially some students support this idea.
11.0	However, some others doubt that this rule will not bring positive effects to children.
11.0	On a personal note, I also hold an opposite opinion towards such phenomenon.
5.0	Firstly, it might lead to the children considering it natural to ask for money for their every efforts, which is a fault recognition.
8.0	Parents' rewarding method directly links students grade with money, which is a very negative indication.
8.0	It does have effects to some extent on encouraging children to study hard, but neglects the real purpose of getting more knowledge.
8.0	As a result, children will have a tendency to ask for money for everything they do though some are their duties.
8.0	A recent research conducted by New York University shows that eight-five percent of students who used to be rewarded by parents with money take studing as a way of earning more, and tend to take it for granted for asking for money as repayment when they complete some tasks.
5.0	Secondly, it is also harmful to the healthy development of children's personality and life values.
8.0	Awarding children with money makes it too earlyfor the rules in adults' world to enter children's lives.
8.0	They realize the rule of exchanging and will try to imitate.
8.0	Generally they will have the tendency to asking for pay for every effort they give.
8.0	They have a higher possiblity of becoming selfish and worshiping profits in the future.
8.0	It can make children difficult to get along well with others.
8.0	One of my classments was used to being awarded often by his mother.
8.0	He have a habit of asking for pay for every effort or piece of information he gives, even if he was communicating with his classmates.
8.0	No one liked to stay with him.
0.0	Thirdly, it can make the family relationship quite distant.
0.0	As the way of awarding is directly connected with money, which make family relationship generally become utilitarian.
0.0	there have been little warmth and comfortable atmodphere in the family.
0.0	A recent research conducted by school newspaper has proved it.
3.0	Nowadays, as the the air pollution has got more and more greater in many regions of the world, which society should pay more attention on.
3.0	So do the government.
3.0	But some people said that the best thing for the government to reduce the air pollution is to raise the cost of fuel.
11.0	As far as I am concerned, I do not agree with this idea.
11.0	This is because there are still many ways for government to do to reduce the air pollution.
12.0	Starting to require the factories to upgrade the equipment and limit the gas exhausted everyday.
12.0	Also, encouraging people to purchase the energy-saving automobiles is an effecttive to reduce the air pollution.
6.0	First, governments should require the factories to upgrade their equipments for dealing with the gases.
9.0	This is because the main cause of the air pollution nowadays is the gases which were exhuasted by the variety of factories.
9.0	What's more, many of them have not realized the problem yet, and their ways to deal with the toxin gases are weak, which really need to be confined strictly.
0.0	Second, the government should pass the laws to encourage people to purchase the energy-saving automobiles.
0.0	This is because raising the cost of fuel can not prevent the high polluted cars from running on the road.
0.0	People who can afford the high polluted cars will not care about the cost of fuel.
7.0	So the effective solution
3.0	With the development of country, more and more parents have their career.
3.0	They don't have enough time to their children.
11.0	That's why more and more teenagers will make crime.
9.0	Many parents think that their children in the school had getten advanced educational resouces, But they don't know in the lesure, they should spend some time with thier children to have fun, so parents should know how to use time effiectively.
9.0	I think that children have a big pressure in the school, so parents should play games or sports with thire children.
5.0	In the first place, I think that parents play games or sports with their children will deepen thier relationship.
8.0	Children all like people who play with them.
8.0	Maybe in this way, children will recognize thire parents is thire partner instead of parent.
8.0	It can let them relaxed when they meet their parents who don't meet every day.
8.0	For examle, my parents always go abroad to sign a contract, so I just think they are a strenger.
8.0	But one day they come back and my father play Ping-Pang ball with me, and my mother as a fine to fighting me.
8.0	I take a match with my father and then I beat my father because of my mother's encourage.
8.0	In the following day, I regard them as my partner, when they come back I aways very happy.
10.0	Futhermore, I think that parents play games or sports with their children will relax themself, because their pressure is very big, play game will take a good mood for them.
5.0	Yet, parents spend lots of time with children's schoolwork, it will improve their grade, but it maybe make them have big pressure in daily life, but play games or sports can make them have a good time.
7.0	That's why I think play games or sports are good use of time
3.0	It is difficult for a parent to just look their children making mistakes.
3.0	Most parents have been got used to doing everying well for their children.
12.0	However, at some point part pf being a good parent letting them do it just themselves and making mistakes.
11.0	No matter how much we want to help our kids.
11.0	Our kids need  to have the freedom to make mistakes and learn from them.
5.0	Your fails and mistakes can be greatest lessons.
8.0	Children experience what they had done wrong and they will know how to do it right next time.
8.0	They will also know how to think about the question.
8.0	What matters best is not the result but what they have learned.
8.0	When i was young,i forgot to bring my homework to school.
8.0	My teacher was angry and told me to get it quickly.
8.0	So i phoned my mom to send it to me.
8.0	To my suprised, she refused my request and told me it is my own bussiness.
8.0	So my teacher punished me.
8.0	But from that day, I always check my schoolbag twice before i go to school.
8.0	So i never forget to bring my homework anymore.
5.0	Anyone will make mistakes in their own life.
8.0	So we shouldn't be afraid of our children's failure.
8.0	By this way,they will have courage to do anything.
8.0	If they make mistakes,they will also learn something from it.
8.0	They will know how to think about their problem and how to avoid making mistakesagain.
8.0	Obviously,our children will be more creative,they will have more thoughts and try to make them.
1.0	In conclusion, if we want our own children to developa sense of responsibility, we just need to let them do it themselves and making mistakes.
1.0	Because no one can protect their children forever, and we can learn to live our own lives by growing up through our mistakes.
11.0	Nowadays, many people are argueing that if universities should spend more money on salaries for university professors to improve the quality of education.
11.0	In my opinion, i think universites should not spend money on that.
12.0	This can't improve the quality of education.
11.0	My reasons are as follow.
4.0	First, i consider that rise the salaries of professors can't improve the quality of education.
8.0	Some professors might not teahcing harder when they get higher salaries, they may still do what they uesd do.
8.0	Paying more money to professors might stimulate professors to work harder but this can not be a long term measure because people will not always maintain active.
8.0	They can't keep this high efficience for a long time.
4.0	Second, if universities want to improve the quality of education, i think they better spend more money on good education resources.
8.0	Good education resources can provide students more choices.
8.0	Students can ues these resouces to understand or deepen their knowlege.
8.0	They can also learn more from these resources.
4.0	Finally, universities should spend more money on the universites' enviroment.
9.0	The reasech shows that good enviroment can enhance people's effcience.
9.0	If students have a better enviroment, they can study more enjoyablely and if study become a enjonyment, their efficience will definitely increase so the qulity of educaion will also increase.
1.0	To sum up, i don't agree with the statement that universites should spend more money on salaries for university professors.
1.0	There are more efficient way to improve the
12.0	nowadays, some people seem maintian friendsships with a small number of humans is more importent for happiness than with new friends, besause they think small number of frsends is less effort that more new friends.
8.0	but other people think male new friends and be fresh.
8.0	i agree sith the following statement than maintain friends with a small number of people have more happiness                                                                                                                    first, it is better to be friends with a few people.
8.0	because few friends are more likely to know you than many new friends anf have less complicated relationships.
8.0	to illustrate my brother  asked him to go to graduate school, and he was deepil troubled by this problem , as well as many new friends, because he loveed social activities very muchhowever, as he met more and more new friends , he garadually found that this shallow relationship did not bring him any help.
8.0	instead, more and more people would take uo his time and tell him something he did not want to know , likesilly, small talk or gossip.
8.0	it is not what he wanted at first, which means he is not happy                                                                                                                                                       second few frie
3.0	Nowadays, you can see more and ore childrena are spending most of their spare time playing computer games.
3.0	Meawhile, it is eas to find out that they are easier to get sick and they are less capable in communicating with others.
3.0	Also, they are giving up many oppotunities to search something more delighting.
11.0	What a pity if computer games take us too much time.
12.0	As far as I'm concerned, this is totally wasting time.
4.0	First, computer games will effect our health badly, and make us easy to get sick.
8.0	Because of many children cannot control themselves to play computer games properly so they will live a totally different life from other normal children.
8.0	They will play computer games until midnight or even two or three o'clock.
8.0	What is brought is that they wiil sleep untill noon of the next day.
8.0	How can it be possible that the chidren are healthy if thet are living this kind of life.
8.0	As a result, the children pay the most expensive biils for the computer games, their health.
8.0	That's why we cannot waste our life in computer games.
4.0	Second, childeren are too small to know that the computer games are all virtual and not real.
8.0	In that condition, they may get addicated to the virtual things and don't want to come back to the reality.
8.0	Although the reality may be full of the homework they don't want to finish or housework asked to do.
8.0	When my roommate was telling his story when he was a child, he told us that he played games very late and he was very tired, but when he went to the kitchen, he found that there was still a dish wating for him.
8.0	Untill then he finally realized that the reality was the only thing that's real and the only thing that can give us a good meal.
8.0	So from his experience we need to know that the virtual world can take our time pointlessly, which we wiil regret for our whole life if we wast too much time on it.
4.0	Last, many other things in life are more enjoyable and delighting than the computer games.
8.0	A book or a poem or a poery can give us great pleasure.
8.0	I was also a child who liked playing computer games.
8.0	But until I really appreciated the beauty of the a poem and a book, did I realize that the computer games are nothing by comparing these two things, because a good book or a good poem such as Forest Gump or novels written by Shakespare can really make us relax or become confident in ourselves and search for the great things inour life.
2.0	So we really should spend more time on our true life instead of wasting them
3.0	With the constant development of the country, whatever economic, medical and eductional aspects are growing more mature and prosperous.
3.0	Latter generations will live in a more beneficial circumstance that the previous one never had.
3.0	However, every period forms different kinds of people, in other words, each generation does not have entirely identical ideology and thought.
3.0	As a result, parents who were being pioneers to their kids meet some inevitable problems when that teach thier children how to face mistakes.
3.0	Should parents let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes?
11.0	As far as I am concerned, with current educational tendency, I probably say absolutely 'yes'.
12.0	This process will bring kids tremendous advantages at least for nowadays.
4.0	The moral ideology and academic purpose's integration and synthesis will bring countless benefits to the children that some of them have to be acquired form making the mistakes.
8.0	Parents should teach kids that not afraid of making errors instead of becoming brave to come up with solutions in order to fixing the problems.
8.0	While they will eventually learn something form it.
8.0	On the contrary, if their parents are not willing to do so, as a result, children probably fear to do make mistakes and a misunderstanding of making mistakes are a sort of failures and that are the toubles.
4.0	In addition, children will obtain valuable experience while they summarizing the lessons after thet making the mistakes, unlike nothing happened, at least thet will know what they should react when they make some errors.
9.0	Meanwhile, basically they could cultivate their capacities of living independently without their parents' assistances.
9.0	So parents should encourage their kids to be more willing to make mistakes and more willing to fix them up.
4.0	Generally, the initial cogenitive ability of children are not too mature to slove mistakes that happens aroudn them and parents intentional behaviors will help them to be more adaptable to practcie this kind of capacity.
10.0	Futhermore, they can play crucial roles in children's lives that assist them become enthusiastuc to face the mistakes.
2.0	All in all, from my perspective, I always support the idea of this kind of action.
12.0	I don't think it's a good idea for parents to offer their school-age children money foreach high grade they get in school.
12.0	Because it's important for children in school-age to shape the ideas of learning,which means parents should help their children find real interest in study.
8.0	Without telling or encouraging them to think about the real meaning of leaning,they may  think that learning is just a job to earn poket money.
8.0	And it's not good for their further study,What's worse,the same ammount of money will become less and less attractice for children ,which means once you start to use this way to help your children you have to keep giving more and more money as he/she grows.
8.0	Once you stop giving money,they may not keep studying hard.
8.0	And all the parents should understand one symple thing,that you can't be with your children all the time,you can't pay for his improvement forever ,so it's much more important to help them find their own meaning of study,not just money.
8.0	And,clearly, just giving money doesn't help.
6.0	Of course it doesn't mean that giveing reward is wrong.
8.0	Actually, it's a pretty good way to hep and encourage the children if parents know how and what to reward.
8.0	For example,when you children get a high grade in school ,you can allow him to plan a trip that he always dream about.
8.0	And in that trip,you can chat with your children to know more about his/her interests,and talk to your children to see if there is anyting you can help to develop his interest.
8.0	What if he/she doesn't know what his/her interest is,just find more time to help him explore.
8.0	Once the interest is found,it will be the biggest motive for him to learn.
12.0	Nowadays,a controversial proposal become more and more popular in people's daily conversation such as some parents should give their children who are student money as the reward for good grade.
8.0	Some people agree because it can prompt their children to be more hardworking to get good grades.
8.0	And some people disagree since they think it's helpless for students to know why they study.
8.0	In my outlook,I totally agree it.
8.0	Here are some reasons.
8.0	To start with,Giving money as reward can let student be pleased to study.
8.0	They wouldn't complant how busy they are because they know that everything they do now is for theirselves.
8.0	That will make they more and more hardworking so that they can get good grades.
8.0	It is no question that if they get good grades,their family and friend will congratulate him and he will be happy and satisfacted with himself.
8.0	Secondly,If they get money for their reward,they can do something they want such as watching a move or buying a vidoe game.
8.0	Doing these thing can help they control the balance of studying and resting.
8.0	It means that these things can help them out of stress and become pleased again to study so that they can be more effctive.
8.0	Thridly,it can let them konw that everything you do will give you a feedback.
8.0	If you do a nice job,you can get reward in different way such as fame or money.
8.0	But if you do a bad job,you can't get anything expect punishment .
8.0	Just as the exam,if you get good grades,you can get money for reward.
8.0	If you do not,then you will get nothing expect your mom's anger.
8.0	I think this aspect of working is useful for their futuer work field.
8.0	By the way,if I do not give my children money for reward,they will feel meanless to get good grades because they can not get anything for reward.
3.0	Presently, with the development of society and improvement in education, people are becoming more knowledgeable.
12.0	Some people are understanding how to lie to each other.
11.0	They said that is not a bad thing, at least for me.
11.0	However, I deem that we should not lie to any people, or we will get loss in the future.
4.0	First and foremost, we should tell truth to our leader in the working place.
8.0	I still remember that once I watched a TV programme, a main character in this programme took part in an interview in order to become the CEO in that company.
8.0	He makes up the lies that he is graduated in a famous university in the American and showing his fake certification.
8.0	He is quite considerate that this certification can be justified in the website.
8.0	Therefore, he passes the interview and becomes the CEO in this firms.
8.0	Once, he represented his company to join a competition, and he won the competition.
8.0	However, his rivals are uncomfortable and finding him in the internet.
8.0	At last, they found that he used a fake diploma is unfair.
8.0	Then, the police starts to touch this event, and he got the punishment that is he deserved.
4.0	Secondly, we should tell truth to our close friends.
8.0	I believe that every people expect their friends to deal with them friendly and sincerely.
8.0	If someone tell lies to the friend, the friend will not want to be your friend forever, because we believe that the basis of becoming friends is trusting to each other.
8.0	If a people have no friend, I reckon that his live is lonely and unmeaningful.
8.0	So, we should tell truth to get the trust from our friends.
4.0	Additionally, we should tell truth to our teacher as a student.
8.0	Take my own experience for example, once I want to play a game in my mobile phones, so during the class, when my teacher asked me whether understand how to solve this question, I answer yes definitely.
8.0	Actually, I have no idea about this problem and tell lies to my teacher.
8.0	Nevertheless, when I attend the final examination in our school, I see the same question, but I tell lies to my teacher and never listen to her carefully.
8.0	Therefore, I lose the precious two points and miss the opportunity to get an A grade.
1.0	In a nutshall, we should tell truth to our leaders, friends and teachers.
1.0	As a result, we will get fruit and have a
12.0	now,there is such a phenomenon in society .
8.0	parents use money to  reward children who get high marks in school .
8.0	this phenomenon is becoming more and more common .
8.0	in my opinion ,this practice has advantages and disadvantages .
8.0	first ,it is the right choice to reward children .
8.0	this approach can motivate children to study harder .
8.0	this has a positive effect on their development of a good habit of study and perseverance in their efforts .
8.0	however ,simple monetary reward is not advocated.
8.0	because children do not yet have the right values .
8.0	too much parental money can cause children to develop wasteful habits .
8.0	at the same time ,taking money as a reward also reflects parents' irresponsible attitude towards their children .
8.0	in my opinion ,parents should choose gifts carefully to reward children .
8.0	this not only promotes the affection between parents and children but also helps children learn better .
8.0	in summary ,I think parents should not just reward children with money .
3.0	When you are facing someone is talking about your mistake, but you realize he is totally misundertanding what you did, will you stop his talking?
3.0	The answer for me is absolutely yes.
3.0	Why?
11.0	Because this wrong thinking and ideal will lead others to judge you in a diferent way, which might make several huge problems.
9.0	Similarily, the teachers'thinking and answer can make students give wrong solution during the test.
9.0	However, some will disagree with my opinion, so I will display my ideal in the paragraph below and illustrate for them.
5.0	To begin with, an wrong answer can create a series of troubles.
8.0	Everyone know that even a small mistake can turn the whole event into a diferent situaton, so when others are talking something mistake, we need to revise it immediately.
8.0	For example, my math teacher used to impart a crucial knowledge point before the final test, and my classmates all thought he's opinion was right at that time.
8.0	However, I suddenly realized that there were something wrong with this question, then I quickly raised my hand and told the teacher about this.
8.0	In the exam, I do found the same question that the professor told us at that day, so if I did not revise that , everyone will lose the scores in this test.
5.0	In addition, when people have gone, there is no one will listen to you, and it will be difficult to transmit the infromation to all students.
8.0	As we know, telling a event is not easy for students to overcome.
8.0	Furthemore, many people will give some questions and doubts wheter you are reliable.
8.0	Thus, this students is busy to deal with these things, in fact, he ahs no responsbility to tell everyone.
8.0	In conclude, first solution will be convenient.
1.0	Finally, say nothing is the most terrible choice.
1.0	You see, If you say nothing about the point you are thinking, it might lead you to I wrong thinking and opinion, which can also make you to write down the wrong answer at the laist test.
7.0	But if you point out that, you will help all classmates not only
3.0	Currently, there is a debate among people that what kinds of people works are more satisfied with.
3.0	Similar tasks all day or different tasks?
11.0	Some people think similar tasks is the better choice while I think workers will be more satisfied when they have many differernt types of tasks to do during the workday.
12.0	My points will be illustrated in th following.
5.0	First all more, I think different types of task can improve workers' efficency.
8.0	For more details, when we facing different tasks, there are more challenges for us.
8.0	Therefore, we would like to learn more knowledge to slove it.
8.0	These knowledge will help us develop our working efficency.
8.0	In the contrary, when doing similar tasks all day long, we will only use the same stragety during working.
8.0	Our abilities do not improve, so our efficency will not either.
8.0	For instance, in my father's coompany, my father always order his wokers exchange their assignments daily.
8.0	In this ways, wokers will not only what they are doing but also what others are doing.
8.0	One day, there is a machine broke down and whole project have to stop.
8.0	But all people stand out and  help repair the machine.
8.0	The problem was sloved in just one hour while other factory may need more than one day.
8.0	It is obsivious that diffterent tasks improve our working efficency.
5.0	Secondly, different types of tasks can make workers joyful.
8.0	To be more specific, different tasks give us changes during workdays.
8.0	And changing things is very interested for most people which lead wokers feel joyful during working.
8.0	On contrast, if we just repeat similar work everyday, we must be very boring and tired.
8.0	For instance, ome of my sisters is a guide.
8.0	When she found this job, she told to her boss that she wanted to be the guide of different landscapes instead of only one place.
8.0	Therefore, she often take tourist to different places and she can also join different sightseeing.
8.0	During the sping festival, she share us different culture and beautiful landscape with a big smell on her face.
2.0	To put it into a nut shell, works are more satisfied when they have many different types of task not only because different typs of works can improve working efficency, but also it can make wokers joyful.
3.0	Recently, an interesting question has aroused a heated debate among people: whether students should spend more time on doing homework, participating in organized activities related to school or whatever they want to do?
3.0	Answers vary from one person to another.
12.0	Some people claim that it should be a better idea for students to pay attention to their school work.
12.0	However, as far as I am concerned, I stand on the opposite side.
9.0	I hold the belief that being engaged in some thing they want is really better choice.
9.0	My points can be elaborated as follows.
6.0	First, spending more time on whatever they want could help yhem present themselves well.
10.0	Compared with other sudents putting most of their time on shool assignment, if they could use more time on something different, they will have chances to learn a new subjet, which helps them stand out in the campus because of the difference between .
7.0	However, the students
12.0	As we know, the parents are the first choice if we young people want to seek help about decision making in the past because they are reliable and always love us.
8.0	But along with the development of our society, more and more young people tend to make decisions about their own lives, just like a tacit agreement.
8.0	So what cause it happen?
8.0	In my opinion, the reasons can be as follows: First of all, the progress of sceience has provided more approaches for young people to gain necessary information or helpful advice, which plays an important role in making decisions.
8.0	It is well konw to us that nowaday we can use advanced equipment such as computers or mobile phones to get close to the outside world and your parents are not your main source to get advice any more.
8.0	So it help us to learn the world in your own view and make choice for yourself.
8.0	What' more, the infomation from the Internet is more convincing because they are always given by authorities in education fields, which means they could be more throughtful and valueable.
6.0	Sceond, the increase of education qulity helps a lot.
8.0	In the past, a lot of people have no access to formal education, which means that they are more likely to depend too much on their parents to make decisions.
8.0	But nowadays most young people have undergone college education.
8.0	Therefore their views have been chaged largely.
8.0	And they tend to plan the future for themselves and make their own decision.
7.0	For example, my grandp
3.0	To paraphrase the prompt, it is students' teachers, rather than their frients, that exert more influence on them.
3.0	As a matter of fact, when students are at school or off campus, both their teachers and friends would have impact on them.
3.0	From my perpective, however, it is a student's friends that would outweigh his or her teachers when it comes to the influnce that they might have on a student.
11.0	My reasons are as follows.
5.0	To begin with, it is self-evident that, compared with  friends, teachers do not ususally have much time comminicating with students.
8.0	Even worse, in some schools where teachers change frequently, the time students take together with their teachers would be even more limited.
8.0	On the contrary, since students take most of their time with their friends, both in classrrom and after school, they could communicate with each other more efficiently and imitate each other more easily.
8.0	For example, regarding the issue of having naughty students fix their problems, it is far more beneficial for such a student to imitate the obedient behaviors of his or her classmates than following the order of a teacher to address the issue.
8.0	Besides, due to the fact that they tend to more in common with their friends, teachers have a far less manifast impact on a student than his or her friends.
8.0	As a matter of fact, due to the sharp differences between teachers and students, it is not surprising that sometimes teachers might even fail to understand their students and accordingly exert no power  when it comes to the influence over his or her students.
8.0	For instance, when a student shows the sign of distracting himself or herself from study by skipping classes for some blockbusters, an intimate fellow of his or hers could be more advantageous since such a good friend could pinpoint the real cause of this student's truancy.
8.0	On the contrary, however, it is more often than not that, facing such a disobedient student, a teacher could easily hit the ceiling and inform the students' parents of  what happened without asking or even wondering why the students would have the thought of skipping class in the first place.
5.0	Admittedly, teachers do have their role to play when it comes to influencing their students.
9.0	Needless to say, a teacher has to be the role of model when it comes to the students' study and the formation of world values.
9.0	However, due to the rather limited time and energy that a teacher could distribute to a student, the teacher's influence is not that much when students have formed their own ideas.
2.0	In a nutshell, while it is more than clear-cut that both teachers and friends of students certainly exert impact on them, there is no denying that it is the influence of their friends that outweighs that of their teachers for the reasons given above.
3.0	How would you feel when you are facing a difficult math problem that you can not solve while there are no one around for you to ask for help?
12.0	How would you feel when you feel tired of working alone and then just devote yourself into playing computer games like CS online?
12.0	From my perspective, studying with groups of people can greatly increase students' efficiency, and thus they learn much more effectively when they are asked to work on projects with other students than just work alone.
5.0	For one thing, students in one group can turn to others for help when they face hard problems.
8.0	It is really a waste of time when you have no idea what to do with the problem.
8.0	On the contrary, there must be some one who are talented enough can think out the problem and it saves your time rather than walking around helplessly like a fly in the window.
8.0	For example, if a student is asked by his teacher to finish an expirement about a new developed medicine with other people, he totally have no idea about this kind of thing for he hasn't learnt it before.
8.0	The teacher wants him to gain new knowledge in just few weeks while a gruop of students is the best way to achieve it.
8.0	He can just ask other people in the group for help and digest the knowledge immediately.
5.0	For another, it is really boring when you study along while there are lots of things unrelated to study you want to do.
8.0	Owing to the fact that most students don't have the ability to control themselves, it is a lot better to study with other students and you both can ask another student to leave the dormitory and start studying.
8.0	For instance, I used to like playing computer games when there are no class in the afternoon or in the evening and the grades in that semester is really low.
8.0	The project that my teacher asked me to do was often postponed for several times.
8.0	Then my teacher changed the way and asked me to cooperate with another student.
8.0	Thanks to my teacher, it really helped me a lot when I wanted to give up study and enjoy myself instead.
12.0	It is awared that there are abundant tasks for workers to do during the workday.
12.0	However, the variety of tasks can affect workers' satisfaction level while working that some prefer various works while others just want do the similar tasks all day long.
11.0	As far as I'm concerned, different types of work can be more advantageous to improve our satisfaction for several reasons.
4.0	The major one noticed by every worker obviously is the fresh feeling different types of work can provide.
8.0	Workers are faced with one task in the morning and another one in the afternoon.
8.0	People often get tired doing the same thing over and over again and may fall into sleep as a consequence of boreness.
8.0	However, when there are two or more tasks to be finished, we may not follow the same patterns to accomplish them and have to come up with something new, thus refreshiing our brain and end up more satisfied when we get the work done.
4.0	The next significant reason is that differnt tasks require versatile skills.
8.0	While we repeat what we have mastered previously, we can't really improve our ability of working and are limited whinin one specific area that may be eliminated gradually.
8.0	For instance, a typewriter used to a decent job for people in the early 1900s, but now everyone have access to computers, a professonal typewriter is no longer needed.
8.0	So it's quite important to acquire more skills in the work and it makes people feel better.
4.0	The third reason is about effectiveness.
8.0	We all want to be efficient at work and leave the office on time.
8.0	But sometimes, similar tasks are just too long and reduce our interest in working.
8.0	As a result, we may finish a task till the very end.
8.0	But when provided with new tasks, we have the belief in mind that once this task is finished, we have to do the other one just like a video game that we come across a series of difficulties.
8.0	However, once we finish them, the happiness just can't be measured.
2.0	With the above reasons, it is safe to assume different tasks are better.
3.0	With the development of economy and society , many parents have enough money to live a high-level life nowdays.
12.0	And a lot of parents will give their child money for his or her high grade.
12.0	Some people think taht it is not a good idea because it would make childen think money is the goal of studying .
12.0	I think it is a good point to award child with money.
6.0	Parents give money to their child for each high grade they get in school will encourage him or her to study hardly in school.
8.0	For example , my  brother Tom who studys in a primary school is a cute boy .
8.0	He is bad at math and he offen fails in his math exams .
8.0	My mom tells him that he would get enough money to buy he whats to buy if he can get a high grade of math.
8.0	In order to get money my brother try his best to study math and finally get a high grade.
8.0	So it is really a good idea to encourage school-age children to study hardly in school .
2.0	In conclusion , there are lots of ways to award school-age children and i think that parents offer them with money is a good idea .
3.0	Recently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate: whether people would spend less time cooking and preparing foods in twenty than they do today.
3.0	Opinion varies from person to another.
11.0	Some claim that people will spend time as much as they do today, becasue they are willing to experience the process of cooking.
12.0	However, contrary to their view comes my perspective that people will spend less time in cooking and preparing foods in twenty years than they do today.
12.0	My points are elaborated as follow.
5.0	Firstly, with the development of the technology, the delicous foods could be cooked in short time.
8.0	because of the improvement of the equipment in the kitchen, people could not be limited by the basic facility which was used today.
8.0	people could improve the more efficiency tools by speeding up in the process of cooking, leading to less time spended in the preparation of foods.
8.0	By contrast, when we are cooking in the kitchen today, we are unable to deal with the materials quickly due to the low efficiency of tools.
8.0	For example, as we all know, a experienced cooker had to spend more than five minutes in paring the potato in the past.
8.0	However, the new machine is invented to pare the potato quickly: the only thing the cooker should do is that putting the potato into the machine, and after several seconds the potato was pared, which could save his time  obviously.
5.0	In addition, in the future, people have to distrubte most of time in the work rather than the cooking.
8.0	The rapid increasing education results in the more severe competition in the modern society.
8.0	In order to acquire the well paid jobs, it is necessary for the worker to devote themselves of the daily assignment, which means that they could pocess inadequate time to cook and prepare foods.
8.0	By contrast, they are willing to cooking and preparing their foods only if they have littile task a day and could spend much time in cooking.
7.0	For example, in my home t
3.0	Nowadays, more and more parents are able to make their kids live a better life and they want to try their best to preserve them and make sure their children are happy.
12.0	So there is a hot question whether parents should let their kids make mistakes and then the kids can learn frm the mistakes.
11.0	Someon thinks the parents should not do that but my idea is yes, they should do because it has many benefits for the yong.
6.0	To start with, I strongly believe that making mistakes can let children improve their ability.
8.0	If parents always tell the children what is right and waht is wrong, they can not know how to distinguish the right and wrong forever because they do not experience it by themselves, they can not have the deep feeling from it, then they can not remeber them.
8.0	On the contrary, if they make mistakes, they will know why and what they are wrong, so they will know how to fix these problems and promote themselves.
8.0	To illustrate, my mother who runs a clothes company, and she doesn't have much time to care about me and teach me some truths, so I must experience anything by myself.
8.0	Actually, I think it's not too bad because she always is not at home and no time to cook for me, and after I falied many times of cooking, I learned that.
8.0	And I feel deeper feeliing than others.
2.0	Secondly, I think making mistakes can make children more indepedent because they will not too reply on their parents.
12.0	I think it's good idea.
8.0	For that student who can get achievement in their study or research they should get bonus because their achievement in the study.
8.0	Like the scientists or artists get achievement in their own academic field like become the first person who solve the problem noone haven' solve yet，or the artists publish the book which had influences in the society.
8.0	The goverment will give them bonus to thank their achievement in the researches.
8.0	The students are same like that.
8.0	If you are the student who is working hard in some subject,or you get much progress,I think it is a good way to award them by materially thing .
8.0	I think it can encourage them and they will working harder than befrore,they will get more achievement in their research .
8.0	Like me I'm the student who can't get much achievement in my study but I m' the student who never give up in my study,so if I get some progress in my study my parents will very happy they always give me the things I want.
8.0	In that way I will working hard than before I will get more progress in the future.
8.0	I think It's a good way to offer theie school age students money for each high grade.
8.0	I also think if the student can get achievement in study they also can controal them in using the money.
8.0	I believe them.
11.0	In my opinion, I agree with the statement which is  that, to improve the quality of education, universities should spend more money on salaries for university professors.
11.0	The reasons are the below.
5.0	First, if you are the teachers of the university, you don't want to take many classes, because taking one class in so hard.
9.0	And if the university wants you to teaching more and more students, so you must ask the school for the more salaries.
9.0	THat is the first reason for me to this question.
5.0	Second, if you do not use these money for the teaching, , you could not use thesemoney for other things.
10.0	And if the university do not support the teachers' enough money, the teachers' may strike for the salaries.
3.0	Nowadays, people are increasely paying attention to kowning about events happening around the world.
12.0	When it comes to the statement that events happening around the world we should ackownlege or should not ackownlege, different people have different ideas.
12.0	In my opinion, I think we should kown about events happening around the world.
6.0	First of all, as long as we konw some events, even if it is unlikely, but we can prepare something to prevent these events can not affect our dailt life.
9.0	If you do not konw anything, you meet these events, it is huge proplem for you, and maybe defeat you.
9.0	For example, people buy a phone for forien company, but this company make fake phone, you do not konw.
3.0	Nowadys, some parents offer money as an award for the high mark their school-age children get in the exam.
11.0	Because they think it may be a good way to encourage children to study hard.
11.0	However, there are still some people disagree with that way because they think it may also have bad influence on a growing-up child.
11.0	Foe me I think it may not a good way to let the children be hardworking on their study.
12.0	Here are my reasons.
4.0	First of all, children may cheat in the exam only in order to get the money and not pay enough attention on their study.
8.0	Because cheating is easier than studying hard to get the money the want.
8.0	So they may pay more attention on how to cheat and not try their best to study hard.
8.0	Moreover, if the parents do not find that their chidren cheat in the exam and educate them in time, the children will continue to cheat in their future life, even in their work they do when they grow up.
8.0	Finally, the child may become a dishoniest person.
4.0	Besides, school-age children are too young to have too many money.
8.0	Otherwise, they may use the money in wrong ways, such as taking drugs or buy some magazines they are ont enough old to read.
8.0	It is my cousin who has lots of pocket money his parents given to him.
8.0	When he gets money, he always use it in the computer game he loves.
8.0	So he pay more time in the game and do not study well.
8.0	So money, in some extent, may make cildren distubured form their study.
4.0	Although this kind of award can encourage children to study well.
8.0	However, that kind of money may let children pay more attention on the money but not on the knowledge itself they can get from their study.
8.0	It means that they study only -for the money, but not for the things they need to learn.
8.0	In the meantime, school-age children, who are still in the period that their way to explain the world is processing, what they really need is the education to teach them how and why they should study for what they want.
10.0	For that three reasons, Ithink it'
3.0	Today, a contraversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people: whether humans will spend less or more  time in the future to cook and prepare food than today.
3.0	Opinions vary from person to person.
3.0	Some people contend that people will spend more time in cooking and preparing foods.
12.0	However, I hold the opposite view that it will takes people less time to cook food in twenty years.
5.0	First of all, there is a tendency that people are more and more likely to eat outside, because the increasing salary gives them enough money to eat in restrant.
8.0	It is easy to imagin that people will be more wealthy in twenty years, which makes them are willing to spend their time in enjoying their life such as reading or watching movies in stead of cooking dinners after work.
8.0	One research conducted by Wuhan University investegated two hundred people aimming to find out that whether they want to cook and eat dinner at home or just eat at a restrant.
8.0	It turns out that almost sixty percent of people would like to eat outside and twenty percent of the others will choose to eat out side if they have a higher salary.
8.0	It is crystal clear that people will choose to eat outside in the future, which will reduce the cooking time.
5.0	Furthermore, the development of cooking skills and equipments will help people preparing food quicker in the future.
8.0	The high technic of cooking equipment will make cooking to be more convinient.
8.0	Imagin how human cook food twenty years ago and how much times it would take.
8.0	My mother told me that they used to use wood to cook the food, which has the lower temperature than the nature gas using to cook today.
8.0	It tooks them twenty minates to cook the Congpao Chiken in the past, but nowadays my mother can finish this dish in ten  minates.
8.0	How is it possible for people to reduse their cooking time without the advanced cooking technic.
2.0	To conclude, I firmly believe that people will spend less time cooking and preparing food in twenty years.
7.0	This is not only because people will use the advanced technic to reduse the cook time, but also many of people wi
3.0	With the development of school-age children study,a lot of parents have a dream that let there child's have a good education.
12.0	I think it is a good  ideal,but i also think we don't need cost so much money .
12.0	we need let our children find some interest in study,so they will have a goal to achieve it On the other hand,if parents always tell their chidren you must get good grades ,they will get pressure even get afraid of taking classes.
8.0	The old sperverb says the best teacher of study is interest,we can use the after classes time let chidren read some book such as english novels or chinese history book,it also can improve children study grade.
8.0	mabe it's a good chance to let children to grown their own indenpendence.
8.0	every coins have two sides,so if we save money,and let chidren study at home,the chidren will become lazy,because at home children need to self-study,and no longer like study in school have a good study environment.
8.0	and if we have some questions,we can not ask teacher for help.
8.0	we just believe myself.
7.0	but in my opion nowadays,everyone's home have a computer,we also can us
3.0	Nowadays, job definitely is an essential ingredient in our life.
3.0	Job not only can solve our basic life requirements, but also never fail to help us achieve our future achievements.
3.0	Do you want obtain a job with unbelivable high salaries but you need to leave your family and friends?
3.0	For me, I refuse.
3.0	I prefer chosing a job with low salaries but I can accompany my friends and family.
5.0	In the first place, living in a condition without any friends and family members, even huge amount of money you get, will bring lots of negative impacts on people's physiological healthy.
8.0	For instance, in the past, I could earn million dollars one year when I worked in comuper company.
8.0	However, I was so busy and I almost spend all my time on writing electronic codes and organizing comuter system.
8.0	This way, I even had not enough time to sleep, leave along to stay with my friends and family members.
8.0	However, I gradually got physiological illness because of this kind of life; I could not sleep can did not want to eat.
8.0	Finally, I queited the job and work in a resterount near my home now.
8.0	Although salary is not high as much as ago, I can have a walk with my parents every night and I can play the basketball with my friends three times a week.
8.0	Graduaylly, my body turn into a normal condition and I feel confortable everyday.
5.0	Secondly, we are supposed to consider for our family members so we need to spend more time to accompany them; therefore, it is better for us to choose a job with more time to stay with our family members and low salary.
8.0	My friend's example can successfully illustrate this point.
8.0	James works in a international company with high salary.
8.0	However, he always have no time to go home to see his mother.
8.0	His mother yearn him everyday and finally get a severe brain illiness.
8.0	When James visite his mother, his mother has not too much time.
8.0	He told me that the biggest mistake he makes in his life is that he only consider his job rather than his parents and family members are important than everything.
8.0	Based on his experience, I realize the importance of family members and I prefer choosing a job with low salary in order to stay with my parents.
0.0	Finally, it is impossible to use money exchange happiness.
0.0	However, staying with family can embrace lots of happiness.
0.0	There are lots of people who have jobs with mollion dollars salary.
0.0	However, they are actually nervious everyday because they can not have fun with family and they have sumless work to finish.
0.0	Therefore, I am willing to work with low salary but I will have more time to stay with my family.
0.0	This way, we can travel all of the world and taste different delicious food, which makes me happy and excited.
3.0	The issue of working ability is highly debatable.
3.0	What  individuals should choose to do can be succeed in a future job?
3.0	is the ability of social or the studying backgroud?
12.0	Persinally speaking, the importance of studying hard in school is outweigh the ablity to relate well to people.
6.0	To begin with, employees who have superb acdamic background will gain benifits to their company.
8.0	This is primily because by studying hard people can obtain superb acdamic levels.
8.0	Their knowledge help them outstanding solve the difficult issues smoothly at the work.
8.0	For instance,emplyors make comprehensive judgement about  their empolyees.
8.0	And the ablilty is make up of acdemic backhroud which can gain high profit when they take part in  a work.
8.0	Therefore success in a future job need foudational acdemic knowledge.
10.0	Secondly, re
11.0	I do not think it is a good for parents that offer their school-age children for each high grade they get in school.
11.0	It is useful  to encourgh children to get a good mark but it also make them lazy when they can not get the money.
5.0	Studying is a personal thing.
8.0	Every student should realize that what they are learning for themself.
8.0	The goal of learn is not to get the money that their parents offer.
8.0	Is to get enough konwlegable which can help them get a job they want and do what they like.
5.0	The way to give childern money for each high grade can only inspire student a short time.
8.0	For example,when a student face some new knowlegables outside the class he may not want to learn it.
8.0	Because it will not in exam paper,learning it will not get the money.
8.0	So children be lazy to learn something new.
2.0	So I think it is a bad idea to do so.
3.0	Recently, with the rapid development of economy.
11.0	More and more people pay attention to the study of children and the ways for them to study.
12.0	Therefore, people always have different opinions about the ways.
12.0	Some people think that students study alone can learn much more effectively than students who work together.
12.0	But from my perspective, I think when teachers assign projects, the students learn much more effectively than when they are asked to work alone.
5.0	First and foremost, though students who study alone can study quietly and will not be enterupted by others.
8.0	They may get some benefits from this, and so they can get high efficiency.
8.0	However, when students work together, they can share their opinions freely and they are supposed to choose the best method, then they can better result.
8.0	Not only can they communicate with each other, but also they can work more effectively by working together.
8.0	After all, everyone do not want to left behind.
8.0	So, they can try their best to work.
5.0	Meanwhile, students work alone must get some problems he do not meet.
8.0	Therefore, they, undoubtly, will waste a large number of time to get information of the problem, and this is time-wasting.
8.0	But, when students work together, this problem can be solved easily.
8.0	Students are possessed with different knowledge, so they can save the time and improve their efficiency.
8.0	I remember when I do the PPT the last term, our team get our work by working together, then our problems all are solved.
8.0	However, the students who work alone remain having something unknown.
0.0	So, in my perspcetive, I recommand that the students are supposed to work together adn they suly can study much more than the students who work alone.
0.0	Only by this way, can we learn much and solve more problems than other students.
0.0	We can save a lot of time and make more friends with other students.
3.0	There is an argument that  a job that only work three days a week for long hours is more enjoyable than a job where work five days a week for shorter hours.
3.0	I agree with this statement.
11.0	The reasons are as follow.
4.0	First, only work three days means that i will have four days to relax.
8.0	In these four days i can do whatever i want, i will have more time spend with my family and my friends.
8.0	Since i was young i always want to travel around the world, if i get this job, i can go travel everyweek!
8.0	That's too sweet.
4.0	Second, the reaserch shows that working for a long time can make your brain more efficient because it force you to finish your job.
8.0	Although it's a lillte bit tired, i think we can handle it.
8.0	However, work five days a week for shorter hours means your life is totally boring.
8.0	Everyday your life will be the same, go to work, go back home.
8.0	You will have no enough time to do what you want.
4.0	Finally, although it seems easier to work for shorter hours, it will make you lose your passion to life.
9.0	You are just like the most wokers in the world, your may feel bored and you can't get out of it because you choose the short happiness and give up the turely happiness in the future.
9.0	"If you have that ability but you just let chance of ""do what you want"" go than what's the meaning of life?"
2.0	To sum up, i agree with the statement that it's more enjoyable to have job where you work only three days a week for long hours than to have a job where you work five days a week for shorter hours.
3.0	Tons of advertisements persuade us to sit down for a break, such as escape for a movie.
3.0	Actually, especially for the students, as we all know, heavy burden of homework make us have no choice to have time to do what we really like.
11.0	Sure it is, I am in favor of the statement that watching a movie or reading a book is wiser for people to relax.
5.0	Here are two reasons for my choice.
8.0	On the one hand, escaping for a book or a movie refresh us.
8.0	Sorrounded by the stunning plots or gentle music,you will have a delightful mood with the effect of the wonderful experience.
8.0	Impacted by a amusing story or appealing poem, you can escape from the heavy loads from the real world.
8.0	These benifits that I mention above cannot be provide by some tiring exercise.
5.0	On the other hand, It is not a good idea for relaxing by doing exercise.
8.0	First, doing exercise is not always safe, numerous people get injuries by meanings of exercise.
8.0	It is common for you to bearing the pain of hurting your kneea or ankles while you should spend your time to relax.
8.0	Besides, doing exercise always depends on weather.
8.0	For examples, you are may be unlucky to play football in a rainy day.
1.0	Considering the risk of doing exercise and wathing a movie or reading a book has no disadvantages, I prefer to the latter.
1.0	With the ever-increasing people to chose to seek for a nice book or a fantastic movie, why not join them and talk about your feeling about the latest movie or best-selling book.
3.0	Nowadays, Internet has bocome an indispensible part of our life.
3.0	Without it, we have no idea about how to work, study and entertain ourselves.
3.0	In this way, wide broadband coverage are supposed to be ensured and goverment should put more money on developing Internet access.
3.0	In this regard, I totally agree with this view.
3.0	However, if improving Internet connection is at the cost of mitigating the development of public transportion, further discussion is needed.
5.0	Needless to say, Internet changes our life ratically in many ways such as ways of doing business, obtaining information as well as making friends.
8.0	But in some rural and remote areas, Internet is inaccessible.
8.0	The people living in these places can't keep pace with modern society's development because of information barrier.
8.0	To be more specific, they can't get information as fast as we can, so they are always backward.
8.0	Introducing Internet access to these areas will absolutely strengthen the link between these people and outside world.
8.0	Also, it makes it easier for them to do things like searching for study materials and promoting their products.
5.0	However, improving public trasportation is equally important to Internet access.
8.0	On the one hand, convenient transportant will increase people's happiness index, which means that they don't wait for a bus for a long time and don't worry about environment inside the bus or train.
8.0	What they need to do is to enjoy a faster and comfortable trip.
8.0	On the other hand, in the long run, developing public transportation is beneficial to our environment becasue to some extent, it reduces the usage of private car, which mitigates exhaust pollution and does good to air quality.
2.0	To sum up, I believe both of developments are important and governent should give the same att
12.0	Currently, a conreoversial topic has aroused a heated debate among students: Being creative is better than planning.
11.0	Opinions vary from person to person.
11.0	Some claim it is true that being creative is the best solution.
11.0	However, contrary to their view comes my perspective that planning carefully will come up the best solution to a problem.
11.0	My point can be elaborated as follows.
5.0	Firstly, planning carefully can make people think deeper and find the most effective solution.
8.0	To be more specific, when we heavy to think about the problem, we will find the other side, because everything has two sides, so if we calm down and planning carefully, we will find out wich side we should to support.
8.0	On the contrary, if we being creative, we will not think too much about it, because when we have enough confident on something, we will not spend much time to thinking about it.
8.0	For example, in my math class, we have a game to calculate a function, so almost students think creative, because they believes that this is a easy question.
8.0	So they do not spend too much time to think about it.
8.0	So the end is they all fair, because this function has a big trap, and you need to calm down to planning carefully, than you can solve it.
5.0	Secondly, planning carefully can cultivate our skill.
8.0	To be more specific, if we do anything to planning carefully, we will develop a good habits, so in our life, we will have a lot of harvest.
8.0	On the contrary, if we de anything being creative.
8.0	we will get into the habit of being quick tempered.
8.0	For example, when i was in the school, i will be planning carefully to do anything, so when i was guratuate, i have the careful habit.
8.0	And this habit help me get a lot of benefit.
8.0	Like in find small mistake in the work, and find the tiny change of friend's emotion.
8.0	Than fix them, so i will have more return.
3.0	The issue that whether employers should have a diverse range of tasks in a day or not is highly debatebale.
11.0	And some people support that  workers are more likely to achieve a sense of satisfation when they get a variety of tasks.
11.0	However, I hold on the view that different professions have different requirements and when it comes to the job satisfaction, the specific  job should be considered .
5.0	On the one hand, having different range of tasks has positive influence on employers who work for the art fields.
8.0	It is known to all, many vocations, like clothing design or building manufacture, need experience new things and environment to come up with creative or innovative ideas.
8.0	Under no circumstances will the designers make a successful product when they stay in the office, drawing the pictures for a whole day.
8.0	As for they, it will be beneficial for them to do some other activities even if they are just assigned to have a rest and enjoy the river or flowers in the park.
8.0	After all, feeling relaxing helps to release their pressure during work, which is essential to designers.
5.0	On the other hand, it is important for some workers who specilize in serious fields to repeat their work in order to be more qualified and experienced.
8.0	Take the scientists for example.
8.0	It is well accepted that scientists paly a significant role in the well-being of the society.
8.0	Every time they devise a new elctronic device or new medicine, it will definitely bring plent of impact on people's daily life.
8.0	However, all these outcomes will never obtained without numerous experiments and data collected during that period.
8.0	It may seem a little tedious or even easy for some people who are in another job.
8.0	However, once a elusive mistake happen in the experiment, the medicine may be useless sometimes may be poisonous to human.
8.0	At this time, they need to do similar experiments all the time.
8.0	Apart from that, doctors especially those who conduct operations also need to do similar works all day long.
8.0	Will you believe in a surgery doctor who attaches more importance to other tasks like learning how to inject or an experienced doctor who keeps operate patients many and many times during working time.
10.0	The truth is that the more time you spend on one task, the more you tend to be professional on the field.
1.0	In conclusion, we should take a person's job into consideration when we tale about the job satisfaction.
1.0	Not all the works are  the same.
3.0	At the present, parents sometimes offer their children some money as a award for their high grade that gotten in school.
11.0	In my opion, it will not make children study harder but will bring some negative consequence.
6.0	First and foremost, if parents offer money as a award, their children will regard money as the perpose for study.
8.0	This thouht are more likely to lead children to a wrong way.
8.0	If they don't need money, they will show no interest to study.
8.0	And in order to get the monney, children may cheat or copy the others answer in the exam.
8.0	For example, one of my friend Jack want to buy a model car fora long time but he has no money at all.
8.0	His feter told him if he can get the top three in he final exam, he can get some money so he can buy the car.
8.0	However, Jack doesn't do well in his subject, so he copy Mary's answer.
8.0	Unfortunately, h was discoverd by the teacher and fail in the test.
8.0	What the parents should tell their children is that study is the key to a bright future and a happy and meaning life.
8.0	This is the only thing that can make children love studying.
0.0	Secondary,not all the school-age student can manage their money well enough.
0.0	Sometimes, they will use the money they get to buy junk food or even do something worse.
0.0	Parents should better teach ntheir child how to use moey first before them money to use.
3.0	There are different standpoints regarding the happiness from the work.
3.0	Some argue that workers would gain more satisfaction from doing different types of tasks while others hold the poopsite idea that to do the same task leads them to be happier.
11.0	In fact, it is hard to judge and up to the context of the work.
5.0	Obviously, the majority of people are reluctant to repeat their action mechanically, because they cannot endure the tediousness created by the same work.
10.0	Trying to do different types of tasks is beneficial for them to keep the motivation of job and is easy to satisfy themselves with achieving success in varied domains.
5.0	Meanwhile, however, other consequences as a result from dissimilar sorts of work are supposed to be taken into account as well.
8.0	The differnt types of tasks would make it impossible for workers to be happy sometimes: they coerce these people to face new challenges and it costs more time to acquaint every kind of tasks which even would be changed definitely in the second day.
8.0	Except few extremely bold people, a huge number of workers will feel quite stressful when something is competely new for them.
8.0	Further, the same type of task doesn't mean the
3.0	Nowadays, a controversial issue whether people are more fond of the work that has many different things to do or the job always repeat the same tasks has roused a heated debate.
3.0	Someone claims that we can deal with the job easier when facing with the same tasks.
11.0	Contary to their view comes my perspective that the former one is better.
11.0	My opinion can be illustrated by the following reasons.
4.0	Firstly, we can learn new skills by doing different tasks.
8.0	When we are dealing with problems, we may use some solutions that we have acquired.
8.0	However, if we always do the same task, the solution would be the same one as well.
8.0	With time going by, we are able to learn more ways to solve the problems by doing different tasks, while acquire nothing new when we always repeat the same tasks.
4.0	Moreover, faced with all kind of work, we are more likely to get in touch with different areas' people.
8.0	It is beneficial to our social relationships.
8.0	Taking my own experience to illustrate it, I had a part-time job as a job assistant in one of college's department.
8.0	My boss always asked me to do all kinds of tasks.
8.0	One day, she wanted me to deliver a file to a selective course 's teacher.
8.0	I did quiet well and explained my intention to that teacher.
8.0	Surprisingly, I went to that selective course a week later, and that teacher still remembered me.
8.0	I felt familiar with him and won a great score from him.
8.0	Thus I have to own the credits to my aquintance with that teacher.
4.0	Admittedly, doing the similar task also have many advatages.
8.0	"As an old saying goes,""practice makes the perfect."""
8.0	We can make something perfect only by aimming the still goal.
8.0	But as for our teenagers, we still do not know what is the most suitable thing for us, so try different things can helps us find our ultimate goal.
1.0	To put into a nutshell, workers are more fond of dealing with different tasks.
1.0	On the one hand, they can acquire more techniques by discovering, on the otherhands, it gives chance forthey can know more people
3.0	nowadays, there has been a trend that some parents offer their children money for each high grade they get in school.
11.0	As far as I'm concerned,I don't think it's a good phenomenon.
4.0	As the quotes says,money can solve some problems but can't solve any troubles.
8.0	If parents expect to helping their children get high grade only by money,that may disoppint them.
8.0	Because this way could make their children become more lazy and just be eager to get good grades not knowledges.
8.0	When they fail to achive the goal,they may seek to other help even to copy other answer,which is not conducive to their development.
4.0	Secondly,some high school in china,such as hengshui high school in hebei province,just only focus on students' grades instead of the comprehensive development of children.
9.0	So the teachers just instill the idea to students that high grade is number one,ignoring the physical and mental health.
9.0	The studnets find that there are so many imporant things in their lives not just grades when they become adults.
4.0	Thirdly,the public moral is also infected by the idea.
10.0	the school become more utilitarian and people don't care those things  which seems to be not useful but actually has a long-term impact to the society.
10.0	All in all ,i don't think it's
3.0	Some voice rised up that students mast have some pocket money for their daily life.
12.0	This is because that without money if there are some thing unexpectedly happened will be hard to work out.
12.0	But if children have some small change between themselves, things will going to be easy.
9.0	For my words, I believe that if parents do not give their children much money and help their children develop a less currentable life-style, children can have a eaiser and self-control life.
9.0	But, if parents do not make their school-age children a clear money view, these will make their child become a waste person.
5.0	Admittiedly, have pocket money can do some thing special for a school-age student, Mostly, the pupils.
8.0	Because people at that time are only pay their attention on junk-foods, soft-drink or even the mulk-tea.
8.0	Some of them have a stronger economic bring will put up these money but the other will finished their money as fast as the can.
8.0	So, if they have a large number of currecy, it was not a availiable choice.
8.0	Howeverm, if one of these pupil have not pocket-money, he or she can only watch their calssmates to try the desert, or crons.
8.0	He will become very despair for his life and his parents.
5.0	As similar as the second paragraph speaking, it was less sense for parents to let the child have much money that they can not control.
10.0	That is becasue most children have not find their value view, so money which in their  hands is only a kinds of paper.
0.0	By the time, if students have their own money, it will be faster for them to faced the sealves-healthy problem.
0.0	We all know that it was difficult to loss a harmful habit.
0.0	But develop a habit is much eaiser than give up it.
0.0	If school-age students have some habit like having a daily bugers, this will make them less interesting from their dinner.
0.0	Parents should take the risk and the degree for these kings of moeny
3.0	Recently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people: Will people spend less time making foods in twenty years than they do today.
3.0	opinions vary from person to person.
3.0	Some people claimed that people will spend less time making food in twenty years than they do today.
3.0	However, I would stand on their opposite side and I believe that people will still spend the same time or more time in cooking and preparing food in twenty years.
12.0	My viewpoints can be elaborated as follows.
5.0	Firstly, cooking and preparing foods can make us feel relaxed.
8.0	In today's busy life, people are facing many kinds of pressure, such as study pressure and work pressure.
8.0	If we live in such heavy pressure for long time, we would be stressed out and could not concentrate on study or work well.
8.0	Then the efficiency of work and study would reduce.
8.0	However, if our mood are not very well and we decide to make some our favorite foods, we would forget the trouble and just take easy to make delicious foods.
8.0	After we taste the foods, we will feel a sense of accomplishment and gain the happiness.
8.0	I believe the people in twenty years are also facing the heavy pressure and they still need this way to make themselves relaxed.
8.0	For example, last week I was worried about my academic paper.
8.0	I felt very nervous for a whole day and I even argued with my sister because I had no patience.
8.0	My mom told me to cook for myself and she said this way can make me feel relaxed.
8.0	"I made a delicious beef noddles for myself, when I saw the noddles ""swimming"" in the soup and I smelled the smell of beef noddles, I was very expected to wait the food to finish."
8.0	Then, when I taste the beef noddles, I felt very satisfied and forgot the trouble of paper.
5.0	Second, making food can make many friends.
8.0	We can invite many friends to come to our homes while we make many delicious foods.
8.0	Our friends can give us advice for food and we can discuss the skills of cooking.
8.0	Moreover, my friends can also bring their friends to join us, then we can make new friends and our social circle has enlagered.
8.0	For example, I met my boy friend in a food party last year, we were first to seen each other at that time.
8.0	He was my friends' roomate, and he liked my dumplings very much.
8.0	He said he was very fortunated to join that party and meet me.
10.0	To put it in a nutshell, I f
3.0	Some parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade when they get in school.
12.0	As far as I concerned, it's a good way to focus children on their study and learn how to manage their money .
5.0	First of all, children wouldn't worry about the shortage of the money when they are studying, which means they can spend the whole time on what they like.
8.0	On the one hand, each-age money provides children with safity.
8.0	They can study and live without scarying.
8.0	On the other hand, parents can adjust the amount of the money by years.
8.0	For examples, if their child is going to learn a new skills in the next year, parents might take the fee of the learing into consideration and increase the amount of the money they give the next time as their child can much enjoy his or her school time.
5.0	And money given by years force children to deal with their money.
8.0	They have to plan how to use and balance the cost between all aspects.
8.0	If they use out the most of the money in the middle of the year, they have to take the result for this unreasonable plan.
8.0	And if they want to purchase the good likes high-quality camera, which always cost a lot, they have to save money ahead of time.
8.0	Otherwise, they should give up or come up with other ideas to make their dreams come true.
7.0	In a word, they will have the ability to deal with a lot money as money for
11.0	I don't think that relax by watching a movie or reading a book is better than by doing exercise.
11.0	Firstly, doing exercise is benificial for building a healthy body.
12.0	By watching a movie or reading a book are only ways to entertaing people but not exatcly the ways to relax.
12.0	Relaxing includes satisyfing one's spiritual need as well as balancing one's body condition.
9.0	Only by doing physical exercise could a people reach these two goals at the same time.
9.0	Typical ways to relax such as hiking, running and swimming are proved to extend people's lives and improve the work efficiency by scientific research.
5.0	Another reason that people are supposed to doing exercise to relax themselves is that watching movies or reading a book are probably not relaxing at all.
8.0	Movies and books are varies in types, horror movies and fictions, for example,could make people tense and uneasy instead of comforting them.
8.0	As this kind of entertainment becoming increasingly popular, it may has lost its original function--to relax people.
8.0	Some cases of suicide and violent events are the results of people's consuming of horror and vulgar movies and books.
5.0	Generaly speaking, I attach more significance to relaxing by doing exercise.
10.0	As people commited to work, doing exercise seems to be unavailable for society members.
7.0	As long as set some time aside for exercise like work in gyms or play sports games with family, people wil obtain the true meaning of rela
3.0	To paraphrase the statement, compared with merely doing similar tasks day in and day out, workers would be better off if they could undertake various types of tasks during the workday.
3.0	Whereas opinions regaridng this proposition might differ from one person to another, I tend to on the side of the statement and am truly for the benefits that results from going through a variety of different tasks during the workday.
11.0	My reasons are as follows.
5.0	For one thing, having many different kinds of tasks to fulfill is nearly an inevitable means by which a worker could make the most use of his or her time and energy in the work..
9.0	In fact, while focusing on one task might be more likely to get one thing done as perfect as possible, it is more crucial for us to realize that, professionals today tend to have a more interdisciplinary carrer than ever before and, consequently, it is far more pivotal to get the whole job done well instead of simply putting all one's efforts on getting one task done well.
9.0	One needs to consult no further than a CEO of a conglomeration or a director of an investment bank in order to realize how indispensable for them to organize their daily work schedule based on various types of tasks, namely listening to the debreifing of others, making strategic decions regaring their companies or inititives and having both formal business appointments with their clients and informal social gathering with colleagues to keep themselves posted.
5.0	For another, undertaking various types of tasks would also be a good means by which workers could relax themselves and help themselves keep their own efficiency.
9.0	Whereas spending long hours in similar tasks would more or less get workers tired of their professions and such a negative cyle would continue as time passes by, having more than one or even several types of tasks would be a more self-releasing way for workers to adapt themselves in their daily work schedule.
9.0	In fact, the drowziness and all the negative feelings would be gone when an IT engineer take a short break from staring at his or her screen and just read some latest research papers relevant to his or her field, keeping himself or herself posted in the industry and, meanwhile, helping relax a bit from the pressure of staring at screen.
2.0	In a nutshell, it is more advantageous for workers to adopt a schedule of organizing his or her workday with various types of tasks  than simply diving himself or herself in similar tasks all day long during the workday.
10.0	While it is of great importance for workers to allocate a certain amount of time on one task and make sure the job would be done as well as possible, it is more paramount for workers to realize that, getting the whole work done well means that undertaking different types of tasks during the workday would be an means by which any professionals could maximize his or her work efficiency.
3.0	I remmeber when I was in high school, students had to follow a strict rountine repeatly, meaning the tasks that we were asked to do are pretty much the same every day all year round, including morning reading, eight classes, heavy load homework, and endless exams.
3.0	It is common known by Chinese citizens' that all of these are for a piece of paper permitting you to go to a college.
12.0	It felt good sometimes to have such a clear goal, but being forced to do the same thing over and over again for saveral years, students started to lose the ability to think independently, which has almost eliminated the possibility for people making progress in metal development, strenghening faith in their future, or having interest in innovation.
5.0	However, people seems more radiant and engergetic after we entered college and adopted much more different way of studying and getting things done.
10.0	Especially with more freedom to take chances and try out things that we have never done before, we tend to become more interested in being good and making the world a better place.
5.0	Undoubtfully, it's human natural to persue for things that seem refreshed to us.
10.0	People would feel much happier to do things that can help them to feel achievement by overcoming difficulties, sovling questions, finding out the unkowns, or getting to understand better about the world.
10.0	In addition, people nowadays prefer to have more interesting lives than living a normal regular life, and with the continuelly develpment of technology, more robots will be used to replace jobs that require repeatly tasks, which would make people's lives much more efficient, but only those who can work multitasks would stay employeed.
3.0	Working in the hustle and bustle of giant machines and limited environment of  a reinforce concrete factory, the workers nowadays can probabaly find themselves so boring with their tasks and work.
3.0	The only joy they may get is the change of their work or a little difference of the job.
3.0	By occasionally change their jobs, they are more likely to find themselves more motivated and more enthusiastic to do the job.
12.0	However, this question differs in terms of which kind of bussiness and company they are in.
6.0	Highly professional jobs tends to have long length of time to acquire for a professional staff.
8.0	For tasks like this, even they could be dull if the works contiues to do it for a long time.
8.0	It takes risks for a factory to change the worker for the job too often, for it can cause the dissminish of the quality and reduce the efficiency of producing the product.
8.0	For example, when you are familiar with typing the words, you probabaly do not even need to look at the keyboards.
8.0	You will also feel quite satisfied because you are familiar and really skillful for the task.
8.0	However, it takes a long time for a person who is not capable to learn the position of different alphabetical order of the keyboards.
8.0	That will definately reduce the efficiency of a company.
8.0	And the person will not be satisfi There are some other jobs that are less required which can be changed for the workers to avoid them getting board.
8.0	When the workers are familiar with different jobs.
8.0	The efficiency and the quality of the work will not decline if the workers are changing occasionally.
8.0	In addition, by doing so, it will on the contrary increase the efficiency of a company without workers getting dull with their daily task.
8.0	On the other hand, if the job changes to fast or there are too many kinds of the job for the workers to finish, it could also not come to satisfactory because too many kinds of jobs will make the worker mess up with the task and they may get stressed out with the job changing too often.
1.0	However, for companies which highly values profits and incomes.
1.0	They cannot ignore the feeling of workers for they can never be treated like machines.
8.0	There are also some works who otherwise enjoy the stable of the job, they are likely to get annoyed if their tasks are changed too often.
8.0	There are high possibilities that they are more efficient when they are doing the same work steadily and unchangingly.
8.0	The factory or the company should know the need of the workers needs.
8.0	Sometimes the satisfactory does not come from what job they are doing but from what working environment they are under.
8.0	The noises and poor environment can not make a worker satisfied even his job changes all day long.
3.0	In current sociaty, children are controlled by their parents and school so strictly that children have no time to do somethings they wanted to do.
11.0	However some people believe that children shouldn't spend more time on school tasks and some public activities, they should have more time to do something they enjoy, but some people don't think that.
11.0	In my opinion, I think children should have more time to do whatever they want anyway.
4.0	First, let children to do whatever they want can help them find out his interest and talent in some field, and let them develope their interest.
10.0	For example, I have a sister who is not good at math, but her school and parents force her to study math all day, thereby she hardly make any progress.
4.0	Until, she started her university campus life.
9.0	Without parents and school control, she found out she was really good at painting, so she started study painting and hard-working.
9.0	Finally, she got unusual achievement.
4.0	Secondly, let children to do whatever they want can boost children's acadamic motivation, and make them study more happlier.
8.0	For example, when I was in primary middle school, I can only contact some formmal curriculums, just like math, Chinese, physics and so on, and studied these boring and cliche subjects continue the day by night.
8.0	Although l was willing to study these in the surface, but in fact, I can't stand these anymore.
8.0	Until I proposed that I need time to do thatever I want, and my parents agree with my point, and I recover the motivation on study at all.
10.0	I don't mean that doing homework or participating in organized activeties are so bad, but we can't let children to spend more time on it, or they will feel boring and lose acadimic motivation, even they will be depressed and commit suicide at last.
1.0	Finally, I think this sociacal situation is abnormal, we shouldn't force children spend more time on dong homework or particapating in organized activitied.
1.0	We should let children have more time to do whatever they want, this is a efficient way to educate.
11.0	In nowadays, young people are becoming more and more addicted to TV and films, they will also receive alot of information from these sources every day, some of them are good, but some of them are bad.
11.0	So some of the bad information will have a negative effect on young viewers.
4.0	People have the ability to learn, many bad behaviors on TV will be shown to them, so young people will try to imitate them, violence and durgs are two of the typical topics .
10.0	Teenagers will possibly influenced by these scenes.
4.0	Second, there is the problem that we loves to copy others behaviors, some young people sees someone performing some ridiculously perilous stunt and runs out to try it himslef.
10.0	This will undoubtedlly put some teenagers in risks.
4.0	Third, there is no strict classification for flims, so many children can watch adult films, this will harm their soul, and this will lead them to become mature(not the good way).
10.0	In the end,
3.0	Nowadays,education plays an important role in our whole life.
11.0	And an issue that which study style is better for student to choose is fiercely debated.
11.0	somebody are willing to have an independent study style where others enjoy to study with their friends or partners to solve all problems in study.
11.0	As for me,I'd like to choose the later one to make sure my study is effective.
5.0	First of all,when we meet a really difficult problem,I dont believe anyone can solve by herself/herself unless he is the descendant of Einstein.
8.0	So we must set up a group which contains several students.
8.0	We can solve the problems by dividing into some parts according to the number of persons.
8.0	Then everyone does his or her own assignment.
8.0	It must be better and more efficient than everything doing by yourself.
8.0	One man can't build a house without a group with a clear division of labor.
8.0	So,learning with a group borh can increase the quality of the project and keep a effective style.
5.0	Secondly,one smelly cobbler is the top of three Zhuge Liang.
8.0	everybody in group can have her or his own solutions to the projects.
8.0	We can put the answers toghther and compare them to choose a best one to submit to our teacher.
8.0	For example,a mathematical problem similar to a deometric problem can be solved in many ways,but there must be the best one to use inside this.
8.0	If I study alone, I possiblely can think about three or four ways to solve even less than this number.
8.0	But in a group,every person can consider two answers for the problem,to sum up, our group will get more ten ways to solve.
8.0	Also,I can study from this problems more because I acknowledged others' thoughts.
0.0	In a conclusion,teamwork in study or work on projects is a way to get the best of both sides.
0.0	For the efficiency in study,group work can save a large amount of time by divide problems into many pieces.
0.0	For the learning effect,we can put our thought toghther to know about more way to solve the project which teachers assign.
3.0	With the development of the sociaty and the transportation, the world becomes smaller and smaller.
12.0	As long as  there are events happening we can know the news very quickly and these news which may will not affect our life may can birng us a lot of thinking.
12.0	And these things are unlikely that they will affect your life may have some big influence that you may not find.
12.0	So I agree with the point that we should know the events happing around the world.
6.0	Fitstly, some events that happen around the world may bring a lot of thinking to us.
8.0	For example, in the last year a ship met accident on the sea and there are several hundurd of students in this ship.
8.0	Unfortunately, most of the students cannot escape from this accident; they staied in the sea forever.
8.0	This news astonish me very much; it seems has no relationship to me but when I think for some time, I found I learn a lot from this news.
8.0	The first we must to follow the regulation; the one reason that the ship met the accident is there were too much people in the ship and when the ship fall into the sea, the ship cannot provide enough small ship for these students to leave.
8.0	Furthermore, this news also teach me that we cannot lose order even though we are being great dangerous; when the people in the ship saw the ship will fall they all very nervous; they all want to be the first one to leave these bad situation.
8.0	Consequently, the efficiency of them to leave the ship decrease and they all could not leave the ship.
8.0	All these details give me very deep thinking and I learn a lot of things like we need follow regulations and to be come down whatvever we meet.
8.0	This news likely have no relationship with me teaches me so a lot.
8.0	So you can say the events happen on the world have no influent on our daily life.
12.0	When I go home, the most frequent words I hear from people around me is that you have changed a lot.
11.0	One thing I am sure in today's world is that the world is changing quickly and so do people.
11.0	Some people ,like my parents do not ilke it .
11.0	Their idea is that changes scare them since they do not know how to adapt to the current world.
11.0	However, as far as I am concerned, I firmly believe that changing is fantastic which makes people become happier than before.
12.0	My reasons are as followed.
5.0	To begin with, with the development of science and technology, a lots of innovations are brought, enriching people's lives and making them more convenient.
8.0	This is to say,  things like public facilities, health care service, and so on , are improved to make this world a better place.
8.0	Nowadays, with the support of the government, when getting sick, people can access to free treatment, which largely improves people's sense of happiness.
8.0	For instance,  nowadays, patients with AIDS can get free medicine in certain hospitals,helping them to sustain their lives for years.
8.0	The soical  innovation plays a iimportant part in people's lives.
5.0	In addition, as we all know, economy has made a giant progree in the past few years, rendering people lead a richer lives as well as providing them with more ways of entertainment and richer lives.
9.0	It is said that material life is the basis fo a happy life, so people now can pursue what they want, buy whatever they like and go wherever thay fancy, they are definitely happier than before.
9.0	Taking myself as an example, 10 years ago, being a poor girl, I hardly ever had the ability to buy things I like, but now I am much richer and shoping gives a great sence of fufillment.
10.0	Lastly, I admit that changing also has some negative effects, for example, nowadays, it is much harder to make real friends and most young people are engaging themselves in online games and seldom talk as what people did in the past, however, all the merits mentioned above overweigh the shortcomings.
2.0	In conclusion, It is believed that people are happier than before as a reuslt of all the advantages brought by the fast changing world.
3.0	Nowadays, an interesting topic has aroused a heated debate: whether it is necessary or necessary for all university students to take history cources despite their own major?
3.0	Some people hold the view that students are only supposed to study their own subjects.
3.0	However, as far as I am concerned, studing history is crucial for every college students.
11.0	My view can be elaborated as follows.
5.0	First of all, it helps university students improve their academic performance in their professional subject.
8.0	As we all know, every subject has its personal history.
8.0	Therefore, it is a precious chance for college students to master the logical system of their own subjects' former talents and get some significant inspirations from the experience in terms of how to think the professional questions and further accelerate the development of their own expertise.
8.0	For example, Bragg is a fomous professor in physics and he has received the Nobel Prize in 1922.
8.0	One time he received the interview of a media and he said the reason why he could devise a brilliant method which had the ability to observe the structure of cystal was that he had learned the history of phycis and found some interesting experiments conducted by another famous professor and got some inspiration.
5.0	Furthermore, it helps people make more friends.
8.0	It is for granted that history is interesting and attracts the attention of many students.
8.0	Hence, always will university students will broaden their social net by participating in the history classes.
8.0	Silmutanously, given the existence of many chances for studensts to communicate with others during the class gap and after class time.
8.0	The relationship between studensts and their friends encountered in the history class will be consolidated a lot.
8.0	For instance, I chose history cources last year and our professor provided us with abanduant time in order to let us share our personal ideas about the specific historical things and work togther in the form of group to have a presentation for the class.
8.0	Therefore, my group nembers lived and studied with me in a long period and therefore we became good friends.
1.0	From what has been discussed above, I can safely draw a conclusion that taking history cources benefits college studenst a lot no matter what their field of study is.
1.0	Not only can they have a good performance in their own subject, but also will they make more friends with others.
12.0	In school, there are usually some assign projects that need some student to be a group to work.
12.0	Some people may think it is much more effectively than when they are asked to work alone, some people also think alone working is more flexible and effectively.
12.0	However, I prefer the first ideal.
12.0	Working as a group is more effectively.
4.0	First, working together can have more good ideal.
8.0	In a group, people all have their own ideals, they can show them to other one and make sure which are the best.
8.0	It is quickly and effectively.
8.0	There is a typical example.
8.0	Every companies all will have meeting.
8.0	It is a way to shre people's idea.
8.0	By that manager usually can get very good ideals to develop the companies.
8.0	It is one benefit of group working.
4.0	Second, very people in group will have their own jobs.
8.0	It can make a huge working become a small work for every one.
8.0	Members in group can't work sotired and save much time.
8.0	Then people can use check their work or improve them better.
8.0	Like mey group wrking in school.
8.0	I also have this kind of project, at that time we usually choose a part of work to do.
8.0	We have enough time to do it better and check them finally.
8.0	Moreover, this is a group work, we all don't want to lose our resposbility, we are all more hard-working.
4.0	Third, if you work alone, it may be more flexible, you can choose the ways or subjects that you interested to do, but you will not have enough time to do better.
8.0	Once, I choose work alone a group work, Ifeel there is not enough.
8.0	So i every neverous.
8.0	I can't do the work well.
8.0	I thinsk it is not effectively.
8.0	Finally, I told this situation to teachers and  taook part in other group fot finish it.
1.0	The group working is more effectively.
1.0	The more and better good ideas and the morerelaxed and enoug time are the benefit of it.
3.0	Can histroy cource becomes a compulsory cource?
3.0	It is significant for universities to take history cources?
11.0	As a common university's student, I believe that we should take history cources whatever we major is, since history is a experience that can help us, and the learning of history is a respect for our country.
5.0	On the one hand, history renders our life convenient.
8.0	To be more convincible, by learning history, we know more methods or truth as the experience from the ancients, then we can solve the same problem that the ancients met easily, and gain their opinions or methods, our life will become more convenient.
8.0	For instance, it has the motto that regarding the history as a mirrow in our country.
8.0	So I read large numbers of books about history, some book claims that we should calm down when we meet some trouble.
8.0	As a result, when I was confuse about some math puzzle every time, I will calm down and think about it in every angle, and every time I gain the wonderful fruit.
8.0	Undoubtly, the truth the ancients claim are good for us.
5.0	On the other hand, the learning of history is a fundamental respect for our country.
9.0	To be more specific, the learning of history enables us to know more about our country, It necessary.
9.0	Consider myself for instance, I went to England to travel last year, and then I meet my pen friend Peter.
7.0	But when he ask me to introduce my country, I found nothing to answer him, I felt shamed
12.0	When it comes to the question whether parents should offer their children money through their marks, different people hold different views.
11.0	Personally, I believe that it is not a good idea to evaluate chilfren by their grade.
4.0	To begin with, parents should pay more attention to children's interests and life.
8.0	It's acceptable that children don't gain a high mark.
8.0	But it doesn't represent that children are not smart enough because the result may caused by many factors such as the bad mental condition.
8.0	Instead, parents are supposed to care their children's talents and offer them encouragement and praisement to let them pursue what they really like.
8.0	Only by this way can children find what they are good at and make efforts to improve themselves.
4.0	In addition, that parents care more about their children's grade rather than their true feeling will bring more pressure to them.
8.0	Everyone has their speciality.
8.0	Some do well in study.
8.0	Others have a good command of art or sports.
8.0	Therefore, grade can be seen as a standard to evaluate children.
8.0	What's more, most children have peer pressure so that they can't be blocked out of the stress accumulated in their daily life.
8.0	If their parents are unable to find their difficulities but to require them to get a high mark when they are stressful, it only increases their pressure.
4.0	Granted, high mark is beneficial for children to apply for a good university.
8.0	However, if parents offer children money for each high mark, it may hurt their feeling in certain extence.
8.0	What's worse, they will have a heavier burden on their shoulders.
8.0	Therefore, it's  parents's duty  to justify children' s grade properly.
7.0	To sum up, it is of less benefit to provide children with money
3.0	For me,I think watching a movie and reading a book is better than physical exercise when I was exhausted.
3.0	Beacuse I am a little fat,I don not like exercise.
3.0	So,when I was exhausted,I like watching a movie and when I was energetic I will choose to exercise.
11.0	On the contrast,if one like play sports very much.
10.0	He will think exercise is better than watching a movie for exercise is an enjoy for him.
5.0	In fact,watching a movie and reading a book is relax your body and exercise is relax you thinker.
8.0	When I work or study a day.
8.0	I will feel tired in my body,I will not choose to exercise or it will make me more uncomfortable.
8.0	Image I finish a big test I will feel tired in my mind,so I play sports with my friengs possibilely,but go to watch a movie or read a book is not a bad choic too.
8.0	So I agree with the statement that it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.
5.0	When you watching a movie you don't need to move,just stay in the seat and enjoy the story on the scene.
8.0	Reading a book is comfortable too,it likely that I live in my own world with nothing to trouble us,it's too much more relax than exercise.
8.0	As for physical exercise,it makes us tired in the body,though it can relax our mind.
8.0	I don't think it's the best way.
0.0	In a word,watching a movie or reading a book is better than physical exercise.
0.0	For the first can relax our mind and body .
0.0	The second can only relax our mind it even make us body more exhausted instead.
3.0	In China, offering school-age children money for high grade they get in school are becoming more and more common.
11.0	From my perspective, I don't think this is a good idea.
4.0	It couldn't be denied some money for getting high grade in school is good for children's high enthusiasm, but it will lead to an unforeseeable result especially as lying.
8.0	Children are young, they can't realize the importance of honest enough.
8.0	Sometimes they want to get extra money, they may lie to parents, which will lead to the result of a bad habit.
8.0	I still remember the story my mother told me about my uncle.
8.0	When they were young, my grandparents gave them money for snacks if they got good grades.
8.0	But my uncle didn't like study so that he never got high grades for extra money at first.
8.0	Overtimes, he began to lie that he got good grades to get the money from grandparents.
8.0	Certainly, they knew his trick, but they didn't expose him at first time.
8.0	And now, even becoming adults, uncle still lies to us sometimes.
8.0	That is a bad habit of dishonest.
4.0	Moreover, while young, parents should help children form the idea that study is for themselves instead of other things.
8.0	Students study to gain knowledge for further use after entering the sociaty.
8.0	If parents always give their child money for each high grade, the child would form a contrary idea that only if I got great grades, I could earn money.
8.0	So they would study more for grade and exams, rather than study itself.
4.0	What's more, to school-age children, their only goal is to study knowledge, so money should not be the thing that they think about.
9.0	Parents should give their child enough money for their need.
9.0	One of my friends' parent is same as the topic talks about, and now he become a man who is very mean.
2.0	So on the conclusion, I think parents shouldn't offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.
11.0	There is a body of opinion which state that the proposal made by celebrities or famous people are more influential to youngsters than to the older generation.
11.0	I personally disagree with this idea.
5.0	Admittedly, young children are typically more into famous people than older people because they have less concerns in their lifes.
8.0	High schools students, for example, work only for their academic performance in the exams, as their parents bear all the pressure and responsibility of earning a living or buying houses.
8.0	As such, they have plenty of time left for watching movies and listening to trendy music which strengthen their bonds with the celebrities they like.
8.0	This certainly is something theri older counterpart does not have.
5.0	I, however, think idols or celebrities have an equal infulence on older or younger fans, since it depends on how much a person feel emotionally attached to the them.
8.0	My friend who was in China feels related with a famous band he liked which named the Mayday.
8.0	He went to every concert they held and also formed a fan group for their idols.
8.0	All the activities he took made his life meaningful and worth living which is something his parents would find challenging to encourage.
8.0	So to be emotionally attachedd with one's idol peopbably does not related to the age of the fans.
8.0	Furthermore, older people are more likely to build emotional attachment with the idols they like because they just live loger than the younger generation and has a longer history about liking their idols.
8.0	When people like a person long enough, the emotion would gradually level up into something more intense like love.
7.0	This love can help
3.0	How to cultivate the children and youth is always a difficult question for most parents to answer.
11.0	Some people may say that they do not allow their children to make mistakes and learn from their own mistakes.
11.0	From my perspective, I contend that making mistakes and learning from their own mistakes are very essential for children's growth.
12.0	Because making mistakes is a very odinary phenomenon for everyone whoever you are and learning from the mistakes is a good method to protect the children themselves and others.
4.0	First, making mistake is everyone's right and everyone can make it.
8.0	There is an adage in China' Even though the saint can make a mistake'.
8.0	In the whole lives, people always make mistakes and then learn from them.
8.0	Because of these mistakes the cociety can develop forward constantly.
8.0	The mistakes can benefit human especially the children because they are in the golden age.
8.0	There is a difference that children in Amerca and China.
8.0	In China ,the parents always take care of their children in every aspects, like help the children open a close door.
8.0	In contrast, American parents will let their children open the door by themselves.
8.0	After suffering a lot of failures, American children can learn how to open a door by themselves.
8.0	They are more independently.
4.0	Besides, allowing children make mistakes and letting them learn from the mistakes can help the children protect themselves  and others.
8.0	After making mistakes children can realize the way they wanted to go is a dead routine.
8.0	Then they can avoid to make lager mistakes.
8.0	They will become a person do not hert themselves and others.
8.0	Like a child who is curious with a sharpen knife.
8.0	If he were hurt by the knife, he will never play it.
8.0	In this way, he can not hurt anyone else.
4.0	Admittedly, the parents should take care of their children carefully and regular their behavoirs restrictly.
9.0	In the way their children will never be hurt.
9.0	But when they grow older, they may be hurt more seriously without the shield from their parents.
10.0	In a word, making mistake andd
3.0	Some people think this is a good things,but i have different ideas.
11.0	There are some reasons why i agsinst it.
12.0	Admittely,giving children money can stimulate them study hard.
11.0	Because they can get money to do anything they want,it can help them release the pressure from study.
8.0	They will excited about it,because they know the effert of them is worth getting reward.
8.0	So they will keep this hard attuited to do another thing.
8.0	Invisiblely,they develop a good habits,and this habits will accompany them forever.
8.0	When they grow up,they can have opportunity to get success.
8.0	However,i have different opinions.
5.0	First,as a student,they study well and get good grades is their responbility.
8.0	If their parents always give them money,so they study hard is in order to get more money.
8.0	For example,my friends is a good girl,she always get good grades in exam,so her  parents give her more and more money.
8.0	One day,her parent lost their job,they cannot give her much money like before.
8.0	In a test,she get high point like the past time.
8.0	But her parents cannot give her money,so she is very angry about is.
8.0	After that many troubles is occured between she and her parents,and her grades become very bad.
5.0	Second,they will make wrong opinion about study.
8.0	Maybe they will think study well is to get money.
8.0	But the truth of studing is let us become a person that have virture.
8.0	If parents always give them money,it will cause children do anything is want to get benefits.
8.0	After they bacome an adult and come into the society,they do not get remarkable grades,because they cannot have good vision to think about these things in their daily life,they just want get benefitd.
1.0	In summary,i disagree with this opinion.
1.0	For these reason ,children will lose the sense of responsibility,and they cannot gert success in
3.0	Nowadays some parents use money to encarage there children to chase high grage in school.
11.0	Almost people don't think it is a good idea for these children since they think it will make these children loose the interests of study.
11.0	But in my opinion, it is not a bad way to make children study well.
6.0	First of all, it is true that offer money to these children will encarage they get higher grade in school.
8.0	Although a lot of guy think the high grade wasn't cause of the real interests of study from children, they shoulde admit children make the score higher.
8.0	Moreover, it is a chance for children to get interests on study.
8.0	When children get high score on it and they realize they can make it, they will do more.
8.0	And with time goes by, children will get real interests of study.
8.0	If there is no reason at first for they study, they won't begin it and lose a chance to enjoy it.
8.0	Secondly, using get higher grade to earn money is same as we adults working hard in company.
8.0	These parents who offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school just let their children have experences in young ages.
8.0	A lot of graduate students said they didn't adapt the working at first, if they have experences when they are young?
8.0	At last, these children who earn money from their parents will know how to use money properly when they are young.
8.0	It is not easy to get money every time for exam.
8.0	And for this hard working they just know they should not waste money.
0.0	All in all, given money to school-age children for they study hard is a good idea for parents.
0.0	However, it is just a begin of study well and  the parents of these children should do more after offer money.
0.0	Only hold the chance to make their children catch the interests of study and more good habits out of study, the parents will get what they want at first they offter money to their children.
11.0	There is no denying the fact that parents' early education has become more and more important in this competent situation.
12.0	Whether parrents should tolerate the mistakes made by children and make them then from them has always been a significant debate nowadays.
12.0	Many parents are too strict to their children so that they tend to punish their children when they make mistakes.
12.0	I think it's unfair, so I agree with the idear that parents should take the children's mistakes for granted and teach them how to avoid them next time.
12.0	Here are my reasons.
5.0	Firstly, there is an old saying goes that 'no one avoids mistakes'.
8.0	The parents often make mistakes in their own work or something else, and they can't finish their job without any obstacle.
8.0	Hence, it's no doubt that the innocent children can finish their acadmic assigments without making any mistake.
8.0	What counts is not what mistake they make but what they can learn from the mistake.
8.0	For example, the famous inventor of the United States, Edison, used to make mistakes during the time when he was aborbed in the process of invention.
8.0	In order to make the factories more efficient, Edison decided to invent something that can give off light to make sure that workers can work during the latter time.
8.0	One experiment after another, he could not make the electricty into light power, and failed again and again.
8.0	However, he learned from the mistakes that it's impossible to tranform electricty into light directly, so he began to try something else.
8.0	Finally, he kewn that fire is very blight, which means he could use the heat to make light and he eventually invented the bulb.
8.0	Acoording to this example, we can understand that mistake is the step stone of success.
5.0	Moreover, making some mistakes can help children to exercise their heart.
8.0	Every time children make mistakes, they are going to feel upset and lose motivation to go ahead.
8.0	If parents choose to critisize them strictly, they may lock them heart and don't want to do what they have failed.
8.0	No wonder that hurt their heart and ruins their self-esteem.
1.0	For my own part, I totally agree that parents should take the children's mistakes for granted and teach them how to avoid them next time.
1.0	As long as parents learn this, their children is bound to embrace a brighter future and turn over a new leaf in their life.
3.0	It is a signifiant thing for a person to determine a most efficient way for he or she to organize a day's schedule.
3.0	No matter he or she is a leader of a company,a journalist of a magazine or a professor  of a high school.
11.0	they have to choose,the basic thing, doing various things or doing the same work in a day.
11.0	As far as my opinion,I will choose only do a single task in a day,and here are my reasons.
5.0	Firsly,somebody will say,different tasks means one can change his mind several times in a day and we all know that if we keep on doing one thing it may let our brain feel dumb and tired.
8.0	While I do not think this is a problem,because we can take rest  when we feel tired.
8.0	Even though you are taking various work in a day,withou the intervals for having a rest.
8.0	You still will feel tired.
8.0	While if you have a short rest after each step of  a same task.
8.0	You will never feel tired.
8.0	As old saying goes,only work  no play makes Jack a dull boy.
8.0	Whether you are tired or not is a matter with the frequency of having rest and which has nothing to do with the sorts of work you do in a day.
5.0	Secondly,only concentrating on one thing is the most efficient way do address things.
8.0	If you take so many things in a day,it also  means you should conduct many begins of various tasks.
8.0	Compared with doing single task ,stating doing various task without the connection between task to task,you should pay more time to get start.
8.0	Take myself as an example,when I going to finish my math homework and english home work in one day,I have to prepare both kinds of reference meterials for checking,while those  work are sweat paying.
8.0	When I pay all my attention on the math homework I forget to prepare the reference material for my english,so I have to borrow it from one of  my classmate in the library,while when I use this to finish my english homework,I find that is not the correct version I want to use.
8.0	So what I have done is in vain at last.
1.0	So we should put our attention only in one single aim in one day.
1.0	It will help us make less mistakes and do things more efficiently.
12.0	People who already had all the things they wanted might don't think it's a good idea, they might think that children shouldn't get in touch with money with such a young age.
11.0	However, in my opinion, I believe that this is a good idea to give money to children like a gift or a thing to encorage them.
5.0	First, give money to the children for their high mark is just like give extra money for the workers if they do well in their work.
8.0	It's kind of similar with adults working in the companies.
8.0	They do better jobs to gain money, and they use money to do things they want to have a better life.
8.0	In another words, it will never be a disadvantage for children to know how hard their parents earn money everyday, they may even be more cherishing their money after they get them.
5.0	Second, we can just see the money as a gift for the students.
8.0	High marks in school is the thing that both children and their parents want to have, but not all of them have the ability to get.
8.0	If the parents can show their children some things to encourage them for a better mark, it will be very useful for them to give confidence to themselves.
8.0	Then, money will be the most easy and useful thing to be as an encouragement.
0.0	Last but not least, the process that parents give money to their children can also seem to be a way to develop the relationship between children and their parents.
0.0	I remember when I was a middle school students, I really appreciate my mother and really want to play with her because she always give me some little prizes when I get good marks, I thought I was very lucky that my mom can stand by my side to understand how I would feel if I will get gift because of a good mark, which is happy, also will have energy to get a better grade next time.
0.0	I believe that every parents want their children to be happy.
3.0	Nowadays, an interesting discussion has arose among the public, whether children should spend more time on doing homework or participating in activities organized by school.
11.0	Some people think this idea is reasonable, but other group of people think that children should be given more time to do whatever they are willing to do.
11.0	From my perspective, I agree with the idea that children should have more time to do whatever they want.
12.0	Here are several reasons I will explain.
4.0	Firstly, having more time to do what they want is good for their mental health.
8.0	As is known to all, the duty of education is not only focusing on the physical development, but aslo focusing on the mental growth.
8.0	With too much homework or compulsory activities, kids cannot bear the pressure from their daily life, which do harm to their mental growth.
8.0	As a result, we should give children more time to do what they want, that is more helpful for their spirit.
8.0	For example, when I was a child, my parents usually told me that I do not have to finish all the homework assigned by my teacher, while I should have more time to do things I prefer, like playing chess with my grandfather.
8.0	And that is really good way to help me balance the study and rest, making me feel relaxed and let me have a good preparation for the next day's study.
4.0	Secondly, children have more time to do whatever they want can improve their self-studying skill, which is significant for their future career.
8.0	With the great development of ecomonic and technology, we should be attached more importance to the self-growth, because this era need the talent people who are equipped with the skill to study new things.
8.0	And the children should have more time to exercise their creation and innovation by doing what they are willing to.
8.0	As is universally acknowledged, there are many agency which accept the children to train their ability of imagination and creativity by letting them do things they want.
8.0	And with the time goes by, the result proves that this training seems have a good effect.
8.0	Therefore, for the children, they should have more time to increasing their hobbies and imagination.
4.0	Admittedly, children should do homework and attend the activities from their school or their parents' instruction.
10.0	However, if they control their time in doing what they want and balance the time between both, it is undeniable that this way is better for their growth.
2.0	Taking everything into nutshell, I totally agree with the idea that children should spare more time to do the things they want, which is good for their mental health and the improvement of their sell-study skill.
12.0	Currently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate  among students: the ability between make new friends and maintain friendship with a group of people, which one is better to people to choose.
11.0	Opinion vary from person to person.
11.0	Some claim that people should focus on to make new friends.
12.0	However, contrary to their view comes my perspective that maintain friendship with a small group of people is more improtant and decides people happiness.
11.0	My point can be elaborated as follows.
5.0	First of all, maintaining friendship with a group of people can increase the goodwill of our friends, so that when we need help, they will be the first time to help you.
8.0	To be more specific, as people grow up, we all will have smoe difficult problem that we cannot slove it by alone, so if we have s group of best friends, they will help as.
8.0	On the concrary, if we focus on to make new friends, maybe we will ignore to get into their relationship, just a matter of knowing each other, like exchanging phone number and so on.
8.0	So when we get some trouble, they will not come to help as.
8.0	For examle, i got to know a loot of people and exchanged phone numbers at the freshman seminar.
8.0	So i think i get a lot of friends in this university, may be some time when i need help they can help me.
8.0	Once, i was on my way to class in the morning and my car broke down, so i might be lat, and i wanted to ask these people if anyone would help me fix the car or take me to school, but no one will help, so i was late in that class.
5.0	Secondly, maintaining friendship with a group of people can improve our knowledge.
9.0	To be more specific, when we have a group of people to play, we can do every thing with them, so we will learn some knowledge form them, because not everyone is ferect.
9.0	On the contrary, if we have some acdamic queastion want to ask our calssmate, maybe they will not teach you the true anwser, because them are have compete e
3.0	Nowadays, with the various company models developed, the working style relatively converts variously.
3.0	People  can decide their working style.
3.0	Some enjoy to work only three days a week for long hours, for they think it is more enjoyable to have a entire time to deal with their private stuff not being disturbed.
3.0	However, the others hold that to have a job where you work five days a week for shorter hours will disperse the pressure from the everyday work load.
11.0	From my point of view, the former is more attrective for me.
10.0	The reasons are as follows.
4.0	Fristly, working three day a week means one can enjoy a more flexible schedule.
8.0	They can either take avacation or participate in some kins leisure activities on another 4 days.
8.0	For example, if i want to take a trip to Thiland, i no longer need to ask for leave since for eache week, i have two more off-duty days with this new working schedule.
8.0	On the contrary, this kind of flexibility can hardly be achieved with a 5-day workday.
4.0	In addition, there is an increasing tendency that many employees are forced to work over time, soetimes many employes are forced to work over time, sometimes even without pay.
8.0	Obviously, a longer- hour workhday suits them better.
8.0	They can take better rests in another 4 days and resume their work with full energy next week.
8.0	For instance, IT engineers in my department often work till 9pm because they do not want leave some minor bugs to the next day.
8.0	However, their hard work is not compensated by more paid vacations or overtime pay.
4.0	Admittedly, for some people such as a new mom, working shorter hours is better.
8.0	It is because they need to take care of their family on a daily basis, and a five- day workweek offers them with more time every day to fulfill these responsibility.
8.0	For example, parents may not be able to pick up thier kids from the kindergarten and prepare the meals for them every day if they chosse to work longer hours.
8.0	However, in general, most people can benefit more from the three-day workday.
2.0	In conclusion, iwill favor the three-day workweek compared with the traditional five-day work day.
3.0	Have you ever seen that some children prefer to play computer games rather than join some interesting activities that need them to use their brains?
11.0	Some people in the society think that technology has made children more creative because they can use many kinds of instruments to help them thinking.
11.0	When it comes to the opinion that children become less inventive because of technology, I strongly agree.
11.0	There are three aspects that can help me to illustrate my idea.
5.0	First of all, technology not only bring convenience to children, but also bring countless chances that can let children be lazy.
8.0	However, children that living in the past didin't have the technology to aviod difficulties.
8.0	So the children liveing in the past must be more smart and creative in order to come over many barriers.
8.0	For instance, my father is diligent and very excellect in math.
8.0	He told me that when he was young, people didin't have calculators and nobody could tell them some formulas that can help students fugure out the question quickly.
8.0	Then he kept thinking and attenpted to summarize the formulas.
8.0	After that, his math became very excellect.
8.0	However, my bother is very foolish in math because he always use calulators and formulas to solve the problems.
5.0	Furthermore, technology doesn't just creat many products that help children finish their assignments.
9.0	It also creates many devices that use to enertainment.
9.0	Many children will be addicted to these devices of entertainmant and put off study and thinking.
7.0	As the time passes, children's ability of creation will
10.0	The mistakes help you grow better
3.0	Many parents would like to teach their children all their lfe experiences and skills and they think this will help children to go less wrong road.
11.0	However I think this is not good for children's growing up.
12.0	Everyone has his own road, and nobody can repeat others' method to success.
11.0	In this way, to make some mistakes in early age and recorrect it, is benefit to the whole life.
4.0	First but not the most, to make some mistakes, you will know what you cannot do well and yu will have a clear way to improve yourself.
8.0	Just take myself for example, in my childhood, every time when I made some mistakes, such as did something wrong or not did well in exams which I could have done well.
8.0	There would always not the critic from my parents nevertheless the idea that I could use to do better.
8.0	As a result of this, I could do better no matter in my stdudy or to do things.
8.0	With the mistake, I clear know my faults and later I will train it and cover the shortage.
4.0	Secondly in China, there is an ancient saying that you were not the god and you can't do everything right.
8.0	So you cannot avoid every mistake.
8.0	To compared with using your energy on help children avoid it, it is better to teach them how to correct it.
8.0	Children will general assembly meet the problem or do something wrong some day.
8.0	If they don't have a training when they young to cover the mistake, they will be puzzled when they later meeting it.
8.0	At that time it will be late.
4.0	Last but not the least, to make mistakes does not lose face.
9.0	For the same thing, one gets over it with parents' help and the other does it wrong and do again until he succeeds.
9.0	Maybe the first one would do it more quickly, however this thing will give him little expressions and give him nearly no experiences.
4.0	To let children know what they do wrong and help them learn from the mistakes is better for children's growing.
9.0	The courage to face the mistakes, the method to cover the problems and the experiences to benefit the life, all these kinds of things can only gain after you make your own mistakes and getting over it.
9.0	As far as I can concern, the mistakes you make can help you improve yourself and have a more colorful life.
10.0	Grade and money
3.0	Nowadays ,parents are more and more concerned about their children's grade in school ,so they use many method to encourage their child to get higher grades ,one of the method is offer them money.
3.0	Which creates many arguments in the society.
12.0	In my opnion ,parents give their next generation money for each good grade they get have a lot of benefits.
5.0	First of all ,teenagers can kown if they want to get rewards , they have to pay their time and try their best to achieve their goals .
8.0	Many children always get what they want just by ask thier parents and than they can easily have it.
8.0	But if they are grow up and can not earn enough money to satisfy thenselves ,that may lead the to crime or other harmful things.
8.0	For example .
8.0	there was a news that a teenager asked his parent to buy a very expansive shoes for him ,and his parents refuced him ,he was very angry and argue with his parents.
8.0	Then he stole his classmates' money.
8.0	why he do that is because his parents did not taught him how to get what he want by his own effort .
8.0	so use this method can develop children's ability to be independant.
5.0	addimittedly , many people may think that if children get money ,they will waste those money by buying the things not necessary.
9.0	But this view is not ture because if children get money by thier own efforts ,they will more value these money and use then in a wiser way .
9.0	W很
3.0	Nowadays parents often give children money accroding to their academic performances,such as their grades.
3.0	In a certain perspective,it can stimulate kids to study harder,however,this may do harm to children's growths.
11.0	In my opinion,I totally oppose to this idea.
4.0	To begin with,kids should study subjects in school out of curiousty and interest,not the money they could get.
9.0	Parents are highly likely to build wrong opinions on childrens' mind that if you get good grades ,you will get much money,in which case,kids will study for money rather than useful knowledge.
9.0	Consequently,once they grow up,it is easy for them to give up studying because they have gotten enough knowledge for them to make a living.
4.0	Furthermore,I consider it is a duty for kids to study hard and get good grades at school.
8.0	There is no need for parents to provide any awards to fulfill their children.
8.0	Besides,money enable kids to do whatever they want,which may cause some problems.
8.0	They will go to net bars or game halls that are harmful to their study.
8.0	In addition,they are too young to deal with money,let alone spending it.
4.0	Last but not least,parents should use other meaningful methods to assist kids get good grades,such as books,museums,tours,to name a few.
10.0	In fact,they all have more benefits for kids than just giving money.
2.0	From where I stand,money can't aid kids study and even worse money let children accustomed to some bad behaviour.
10.0	If parents really worry about kids'study,
3.0	Now, many partents intend to their children have a good grade when they study at school,so they will give some money if their children gain a excellent grade.
12.0	In my opinion,I think it is a very good idea,because children want to buy some toys or books,they have to study hard and try their best to review the exam,so it is a positive and good way to make children study much hard.
11.0	I have two reasons about why I think it is a good idea.
5.0	Firstly,I want to talk a reason which is  children want to buy some books and toys or they intend to hold a party with their friends,so they will study hard.
8.0	As we all know that present children hope to buy somethings which is very cool or expensive,so that their friends will think they are very fashionable.
8.0	If kids want to do these,they must gain a good grade about an exam,so their parents will offer some money tothem that they can buy everything what they like.
8.0	All in all, I think this idea is good.
5.0	Secondly,I will tell you another reason about this idea.
10.0	many children can't control the money or time well when they become an adult,so if their parents offer money when they get good grades,they think how to use these money and it will practices these children's ability.
7.0	In short,I think this idea is good,because it can make children have a good gr
12.0	If we don't have the televisions in our lives, we could not know the thing happening around the world, nd we could not see the views all around the world.
11.0	So, that's why I think the movies and the televisions have more positive effects than negatives effects.
4.0	First, if we don't have the movies and the televisions, we could not know the things happening all around the world and see the views we haven't bee watched.
8.0	For example, before the televisions innovated, we could only know the things happening all around the world by the newspapers and the magzines.
8.0	And we could only see the letters to describe the beautiful views and where is it.
8.0	But when the scientists innovated the televisions, we could know the things happening all around the world which is recorded by the repoters.
8.0	And we can also see the beautiful views and know how the nature made it.
8.0	So, the young people could learn the knowledge and know more about the world.
4.0	Second, because we have the movies, we could spend our free time by a variable way which is watching the movies.
8.0	Why do I think the movies is a good way to spend our time?
8.0	Because we could make the movies which is based on our imagine worlds or some impressable views in the history.
8.0	For example, we could imagine the ancient ages, and we could make the movie based on the history frameworks.
8.0	And also, we could improve our creativity by watching or making (if you could) the movies.
8.0	This is a good way to train the brains of the young people.
4.0	Lat of all, some people would say that if you watch too many television programs or movies, your sight would turning down of have ill.
10.0	But I don't agree with the statement, becuse if you watch the movies and the television programs by having time limit, and do some actions to release the pressure of your eyes, your sight would not turns down.
2.0	So, that's why I think the movies and the televisions have more positive effect than negative effects of the young people.
3.0	Different high school teacher have different education style to  cultivate students.
11.0	Some teacher believe that teacher should find students that are really need help and help them make their own future carrer.
12.0	However, I totally believe that helping students to learn by themselves is the most important .
4.0	Although helping student to make their future plan can save them a amout of time inthe future.
8.0	Besides, after students making plan for their future the still need to give effort for theri dream.
8.0	If they don't hardworking for their plan, their plans are just dreams.
8.0	And, those plan that students make maybe will cause students be lazier than before.
8.0	For instance, when I studied in my high school, my neighbour class teacher asked his students to choose one university they want to go.
8.0	All of his students choose very high level university.
8.0	When middle exam caming, they didn't get good grades.
8.0	But, they still missed some important classes because they thought they could join the high level university.
8.0	The result is almost fifty percent of students got fail in the final exam.
8.0	So, making a plan for future is not very important for high school students.
4.0	Comparing with that, if students have ability to study by themselves outsied of the classrome, they go to libray or the nature, they could easier to get more intellegience from textbooks or nature.
9.0	They can research the yellow cedar for their biology exam, do some part time job like restaurant adimistrator for their statistic exam and so one.
9.0	According to their own experience, they could not only enjoy their spare time but also increase their academic grades.
4.0	Finally, high school teacher don't have enough time for finding students that really need help.
8.0	Although they find this kinds of student, thay will find that it is hard to improve their grades cause those students are don't want to study .
8.0	If high school teacher spend too much time on those students, that unfair to other students that want to ask some question.
8.0	If they still do that, the result is the grades of almost sixty percent of students will decrease.
2.0	To sum up, high school teacher should encourage and help thier student to study by themselves outside of the classroom.
3.0	The society is developing constantly at a very fast pace,so it's inevitable that we have a lot of things to deal with to catch up with the trend.
11.0	Therefore, i think it's necessary to have the ability to plan and organize,otherwise we would get lost in the torrent.
5.0	To begin with, having the ability to plan and organize can help us cope things more logically and clearly.
8.0	With an well-designed organization, I know clearly what I should do today at a specific time and place and I wouldn't get confused or find nothing to do.
8.0	What's more, I wouldn't miss out a thing that might be important to you.
8.0	For example, when I was little, I always did things without any plan.
8.0	I do anything just according to my own mood and interest.
8.0	I love math so i did the math homework first and leave the Chinese composition to the last.
8.0	Hence, every Sunday night i struggled with the composition and didn't go to sleep until midnight.
8.0	That really develope a bad habit and it's harmful for my health.
8.0	If i had plan and organize, i wouldn't feel tired in the Mondar morning and effeted my study.
5.0	Besides, the ability to plan and organize gives me an aim I need to fight for.
8.0	Sometimes you did one thing just because of it's your job or someone ask you to do so, you wouldn't stop to think about the meaning of it.
8.0	Keep working without a plan makes you like a working machine and even yourself have no idea why you're doing this.
8.0	Thus, haveing a plan is really essential.
8.0	For instance, when i was in high school, i always had trouble learning biology, but to break through this, i just keep doing exercise all the time but didn't try to understand the basic knowledge it want to convey during the process.
8.0	It turns out that it's meaningless.
8.0	However, my teacher told me that i need to know the reason i'm doing this,not just because of the practices but the thoughts and ideas i used to solve this problem.
8.0	Later, i made out a plan and it worked well for my progress.
1.0	Above all, what i want to illustrate is that the ability can guide you on your way to the success, it help you perform more wonderful.
1.0	With some much distractions around ,you need to be clear what you want.
3.0	I disagree with the statement.
11.0	My main point is quite simple, modern people need exercise more than movies or books, even if they probably don't like it.
12.0	First of all, modern citizens are having worse health conditions every single day, mostly due to their lack of exercise.
12.0	People are generating more and more fat, that's a big problem to everybody even if they don't want to confess this.
10.0	No one would be happy if he's to fat, if  people are unhappy, how come they can be relaxing for a long time?
5.0	Secondly,exercise can help people build up their selfconfidence.
9.0	It is becase exiercise is hard for us to   keep on, there will be so much more pleasure when we really did it.
9.0	No such confidence will be built if we just sit there reading or watching other people's work.
5.0	Finally, taking exercise for leisure is quite different from other activities, especially when you do it outdoors.
8.0	It's the best way for us to get ride of a day's boring work and embrace our mother nature.
8.0	Taking an action is always better than submerged in the world of imagination, like what books and movies often creat for us.
8.0	Taking exercise calls our original abiilities back to our life, which is long forgotten in the modern way of life.
3.0	Recently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people: During economic crisis, which one of the following expenditures should be reduced by goverment: library, police or public transportation?
3.0	As far as I am concerned, government should cut down the expenditures of library.
11.0	My point can be elaborate as follows.
5.0	To begin with, library is not necessary during the economic crisis.
8.0	To be more specific, people are very anxious because they lost their property and jobs.
8.0	What they need to do is to find a job or way to earn some money and make a living.
8.0	They need would never have time and money to read books.
8.0	For example, my uncle Wang lost his job and most of his property during the economic crisis in 2014.
8.0	He also had three kids, old father and mother.
8.0	He need to find a job to earn enough money so that he can afford his family's life.
8.0	He spent all his time to search a job and did some part-time job at the same time.
8.0	Although he was crazy about reading and always visist library before, he never read book during the economic crisis.
5.0	On the contrary, police is necessary during the economic crisis.
8.0	To illustrate, some people lost hope of making a living since thay might lost all their property, jobs and even family.
8.0	This kind of people might do some illegal things such as robbing and stealing.
8.0	In this case, we need more police to ensure the public security.
8.0	Thus government should increase the expenditures of police instead of reduce it.
8.0	For instacne, at the start of the economic crisis, there were many thieves in our country.
8.0	Then government hire more police in order to improve the publice security and it worked.
0.0	What' more, public transportation is also necessary during the economic crisis.
0.0	This is because government can reduce unemployment through funding some new transportation project which can create a lot of jobs.
0.0	It is very good for social stable since people do not complain if they have a job to make a living.
0.0	For example, my country funded new metro during the economic crisis and millions of people get the jobs from those projects.
0.0	And our society is very stable during the econimic crisis.
3.0	Nowadays, education is a hot topic.
11.0	The opinions of whethwe all of the university students should be required to study hoistory no matter what thier field of study is are divided.
11.0	Some people say it is necessary because history is a really useful subject while other people argued because they think it is just a waste of time.
11.0	However, in my opinion, I strongly believe that learning history should be required.
5.0	Firstly, we can avoid making the mistakes that the ancient people make by learning history.
8.0	"There is an old Chinese saying,""People who learns history can gain many things."""
8.0	Just like the saying, when I hear some interesting stories when I'm having history classes, I can learn many important things.
8.0	For exampie, from the YING ZHENG, who is one of the most famous emperor who built the Great Wall, I konw that although his idea and work are great, we still should think for others before we begin doing something; From the story of ZENGZI in China, I konw the importance of being honest......
8.0	If I can get so many things from these history classes, university students can do so,too.
5.0	Secondly, although some students may compiain that they can not even get grades in their main subject, so they do not have any effort to study a new subject---history.
8.0	However, I think that you might can find your own joy by learning this subject can relax yourself.
8.0	As for me, I always enjoy myself when I am learning history and I develop a new strengh.
8.0	Isn't it a great thing?
0.0	So, all in all, I thinl all university siudents should be required to learn history, it can really help them a lot.
0.0	So what are you waiting for?
0.0	Start learning history now!
11.0	In my own consideration , I cannot agree with such strategy.
4.0	Any strategy will have its benefits, though.
8.0	Use money as an award and source of motivation to stimulate the interest of children about study.
8.0	It may get very impressive result in the short run.
8.0	Children who are really thurst for some awards such as expensive toys, candies etc. will obviously make their effort to study much harder to get their target accomplished.
4.0	But , however .
9.0	First , If the problem of school-aged children confronted is not the motivation of study , but the method of study , this stimulate machanism will just drive them into a more anxious status that studying not well is not just a problem but a sign that their parents will not love(award) them.
9.0	This will obviously lead to a cycle that maybe result in a fear of study itself in the end.
4.0	Besides , children's mental area are easy to be manupulated.
8.0	Guiding them with physical material to push their study makes no different from training dogs with bones.
8.0	Dogs will chase the bone , but in the long run ,they will only responde when their masters throw object.
8.0	So does children that are awarded in such machanism.
4.0	Study is a long term behavior , even throughout our lives.
8.0	So , if these parents really want their children get good scores in the exam and enjoy study in the long run.
8.0	To study with them , communicate with them , take part in the whole period of early study and help their children to establish their own interest and good habit .
8.0	Try their best to provide their children with an environment that is suitable for study.
8.0	Only in this way, as Children grow up ,their habit of study will be firmly established and maintained.
1.0	So, pay more on heart and attention rather than cash and toys.
1.0	Finally your children will get their own way for studying.
3.0	when it comes to children's grades, every parents hope their children get good grades, but not every children will not let their parents down.
3.0	therefore, some parents will offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.
12.0	They think maybe money will let children restart study.
5.0	Form where I stand, it is a good idea.
8.0	even if children, they also need money to buy something they like.
8.0	Although, most of their things are bought by their parents.
8.0	the more poket mone they have, the more things they can do.
8.0	So, they will struggle to get more poket money.
8.0	If parents will give them money because of their good grades, they will get more high marks to earn money.
5.0	My little brother is a positive example.
8.0	He is not good at English.
8.0	Sometimes he even absent in his English class.
8.0	And abandent English completely.
8.0	However, he likes eating snacks, my uncle decrease his pocket money for getting bad grades in English.
8.0	And my uncle also told to my brother that he would never buy snacks if you get another bad grade.
8.0	If you restart studying English.
8.0	And require a better mark, I will give you money to buy anything you want to eat.
8.0	Nowadays, my brother not only good at English, but also reqire money form his parents to snacks.
2.0	Money is a kind of encourgy, it give children a intrests to do sometihng.
3.0	Recently, an interesting topic aroused a heated debate among the public: which one is better: follwing the dreams which need a lot of efferts or focusing on achieving realistic goals.
3.0	The answer vary from person to person.
11.0	Some peoplewill choose the achieving realistic goals because they think that will easier to achieve, while in my perspective, I will choose the ambitious dream.
11.0	My reasons are as follows.
6.0	First, the further and ambious dreams will make peopel have motivate to achieve,which will rreative their abiliy of persist.
8.0	That is because that when people make the dreams come ture, they will have more benefits.
8.0	In that way, they will have more motivate to reach, they insist to that things.
8.0	For long time, the ability of persist will be cultivated.
8.0	When they meet some thing which they feel difficult, they would not easy to give up.
8.0	Take me as an example.
8.0	When I was nine years old, I wanted to be a pianoist.
8.0	My mom told me to achieve that dream will experience many difficult and make more efferts.
8.0	I insist to play the piano every day.
8.0	Finally, last year,I was invented to play a performance on the stage.
8.0	And I learn for the experience of learning piano: do not easy to say give up.
0.0	Second, the ambitious dreams will bring us a huge sense of achievement and confident, when people reach the aim.
0.0	As we all know, to finish the ambitious dream will cost a lots the energy and efferts.
0.0	So when we finnally did, we will feel very happy and that will built up people's confidence.
9.0	To illustrate, my brother wanted to make 100 million dollors per year.
9.0	Through the consistant efferts, he made his won company and achieve his dream.
7.0	He was so happy and when I
3.0	Nowadays,more and more attention has been set in the  education of the school-age children in every family.
3.0	Every parents hope their children can have a good grade.
3.0	And some parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.
11.0	I don't think it's a good idea.
4.0	As far as i can see,the main reason thoes parents use money as a prize for high grades is because they want to encourage their children to study harder and keep getting good grades in school.
10.0	However,this have many nagative impacts.
4.0	First of all,in this way,children may tend to only do things which are rewarding.
9.0	For example,if they won't get anyting by doing homework,they may don't want to do that.
9.0	As a result,parents have to provide money to encourage their children to do anything.
4.0	Second,children will tend to ask their parents for money if they are often rewarded with money for good grades.
9.0	They will think that their parents have a lot of money and should provide their with money.
9.0	When they grow up and become young adults,they will still turn to their parents foe money instead of getting a job and earning money by theirself.
4.0	What's more,when children get their money,they usually use it to do something that may have a bad influence to their study.
9.0	For example,i saw children,after receiving money from their parents,immediately ran to the nearest internet bar and started playing video games all night.
9.0	If their parents had known how their children wasted their money they earned by hard work in this way,they would have been very upset.
1.0	All in all,we should let the children know one thing:working hard is for their own future,not for money.
1.0	So,i think offer school-age children money for cach high grade they get in school is a bad idea.
3.0	Nowadays, every parent pays more attention on their children, bacause they want them can own a prospected future.
3.0	Thus, they are a child, parents are worry about their grades.
3.0	When they grow up, parents will concern their job in the future.
3.0	Hence many parents want their children can choose a job that is similiar to them.
11.0	But in my opinion, I think parens do not need to focus on the children's chioce of job.
8.0	This is because, the society is developing, even their children choose a job is same to parents, it does not mean you can help them, bacause in that time, parent's experience is old fashion.
8.0	Second, maybe the job that is similar to the parent's job is not fit children.
8.0	Finally, c
5.0	First, I think the society is developing, but our parents are getting old and old.
8.0	It will meas that sometimes their experience is not suitable this environment.
8.0	In that case, if we follow this old rules, they do not give us help.
8.0	My uncle, for example, is a teacher, and his parents are teachers too.
8.0	Nonetheless, when my uncle becomes a teacher, his parents always told him their own experience that do not have any help for him.
8.0	For example, his parents thinks if students cannot remember a formula or a concept, teachers should require them write these again and again,until they remember.
8.0	However, my uncle thinks that teacher should help students understand the meaning of these knowledges, then they can memorize these points well.
8.0	But his parents still persist their opinions, and require my uncle modify his teaching style.
8.0	The result is that it brings a lot of pressure for my uncle, now, he told his family that he want to quit this job.
8.0	Hence, according this instance, we can know if we choose a job that is similat to our parents, we will be under too much stress.
5.0	Second, the job that is likely to parents job does not means that this job is suitable for us.
8.0	If we choose a job that is not fit for us, we wil feel uncomfortable, meanwhile, it will waste a lot of our time.
8.0	There is a example.
8.0	My sister's parents are working at administration.
8.0	In other's eyes, they think this is a good job, bacause administrators can earn a lot of money and enjoy a lot of goods.
8.0	Because the surrording environment affect my sister, so when she graduate from university, she find a job about administration.
8.0	Nevertheless, when she starts work, she found that the atmosphere of the unit is serious, and she needs to finish many tasks everyday.
8.0	Thus, when this situation lasts a long while, she decided to give up this job.
8.0	bacause she thought this job is not fit for her.
8.0	Everyday every tasks will drive her crazy.
8.0	So, after that, she become a nurse, and she told me that she satisfies her situation now.
2.0	Finally, it is an opportunity for us to try to different things and extend our scope of knowledge.
7.0	If we always do the same job, we will feel tired
11.0	I think it is a good idea.
12.0	My reasons are listed below.
5.0	First of all, it is known to all that without a reword you will not have passion to do one thing.
8.0	It is apparently that if you give money to your kid for a good mark,they ,of course,will study harder to achieve a good grade.
8.0	When kids know that they will be reworded for a good mark,no wonder they will burst into excitment to bury themselves into study.
8.0	Second,both parents and kids will be happy if a kid will be reword for a good mark.
8.0	Not only the kids study better,but also they can buy what they want,which is a good circulation to make study happier.
8.0	At the same time ,their parents will be glade to see that they become loving study.
8.0	Third,when kids are aworded alot it means that they have already become good students,that is when parents should abandon the rule and give them money monthly or weekly.
8.0	Because when being a good student become a habbit,they will become better and better.
8.0	Last but not least,parents should teach their kids how to fair use  thier money at a young age.
8.0	Otherwise,when they have a large amont of money at that age,they will not know how to use and what to buy.
8.0	For this reason,parents should not give too much money.
5.0	All in all,offer money to kids for a good grade is a good idea.
8.0	"As a saying goes""no pain,no gain""."
8.0	The kids will know more time they spend on studying lectures,more money they can aword.
8.0	Also,kids will think study happier than before as they can buy toys they want.
8.0	At the same time,parents will be glade to see their kids' grade grow higher and higher.
10.0	Do not hesitate,
3.0	In the summer vacation, are you willing to play the computer games or read more books and have some creative thinking?
4.0	Firstly, children have less time to have some creative thinking.
8.0	Children nowadys have more stress in acdemic than those in the past.
8.0	The students in our country have to get up at 6 a.m and stay up late at 12a.m every day, because they endeavor to get their school performance better than other students.
8.0	They are willing to sacrifice their sleeping time to achieve the acdemic work excellent, but if they want to be more creative than peers, they need to read more books and meditate more.
8.0	On the contrary, there are few students are willing to sacrifice so much especially their sleeping time.
8.0	But the students in the past have less stress than the modern children.
4.0	In addition, children are less considerable about their surrouding world.
8.0	Modern children indulge in playing games of computer or mobile phone, because they are more intriguing than the books and those creative things are boring to them.
8.0	Those games are exciting and could give them a sense of proud immediately when they win the games.
8.0	However, the books are not exciting
4.0	Finally, children nowadays have less independent thinking.
8.0	Their minds are more dependent on the known knowlege and their parents or their teachers.
8.0	Nevertheless, independent thinking is  fundemental for creative thinking.
8.0	Many children like to finish their homework by searching books or Internet, and asking assistence from their parents and teachers.
8.0	Schoolwork is their obligation to finish, but they rely on other things deeply.
8.0	So  when they do another thing or meditate other things, they would rely on exterior world too.
7.0	But the parents or teachers in the past have less time to care for children, because making money is were more crucial than the nowadays parents
3.0	Recently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people: whether is it as essential for older people to learn new things as it is for younger people?
3.0	Opinions vary from person to person.
11.0	Some people claimed that it is not as improtant for the elder to study as it is for young people.
11.0	However, I would stand on their opposite side and I believe that it is vital for older people to study as it is for the young.
12.0	My viewpoints can be elaborated as follows.
5.0	Firstly, it would increase the level of knowledge of the whole citizens include the older people, if older people study or learn new things.
8.0	With the development of electric technology, older people would not understand the advanced technology or knowledge.
8.0	If we just concentrate on the education of younger people, the level of whole citizens of knowledge and culture would unchange or go back.
8.0	If we want to make a big progress in national civilization, we should pay as the same attention to the older people as we pay attention to the younger people.
8.0	For example, Wuhan was assessed as advanced city last year because the older people which from Wuhan took part in the scientific model contests and got good grades.
8.0	More and more older people now are encouraging to learn more new things and our level of knowledge has been increased.
5.0	Secondly, older people would feel happiness if they learn new things.
8.0	Many people would think that it is unnecessary for older people to study in their current ages.
8.0	However, if older people study or learn new things, they would feel sense of accomplshment and feel happiness because it is not easy to achieve for older people.
8.0	They can also share new things with their family.
8.0	For example, my grandmother learned a new cook way about western food two years ago.
8.0	We were very moved when she cooked western food for us and all of us prasied her and hugged her.
8.0	She said she was very happy and feel a sense of accomplishment.
1.0	To put it in a nutshell, I firmly think it is as essential for older people to study as it is for younger people.
1.0	Because it not only can increase yhe level of knowledge of the whole citizens, but also can bring happiness.
3.0	With the development of the society and the econome, there are a lot of new things come into our life and all of these things make our life more and more comfortable and relax.
3.0	Do you think now we have more things to play and those things are more interesting than before?
3.0	Do you feel the transportation is more quickly and efficient than before?
11.0	And the most important is we can buy the things we want very convinient.
11.0	So for this opnion I think today's life is more comfortable than before.
5.0	Firstly, the things that we can play them to relax become larger than before and we can find more fun from them.
8.0	In before we just could found a little number of tv channel that we may not truly like, but now we can enjoy a large number of tv shows.
8.0	If we like sports, we can watch the channel about the sports.
8.0	And if we want to see some movies, we can look them from the movie channel.
8.0	Whatever we like we can see them on the tv.
8.0	Moreover, with the development of the phone, we can do a lot of things like listen to the music and watcht the news rather than just site at the sunshing during our relax time.
5.0	Second, the transportation become more quickly than before.
8.0	In the before we arrive to a far place need long time and the time when we stay at the car or train is very boring and uncomfortable.
8.0	Nowdays if we want go to far place we can rite the plane that is very quickly and we can enjoy the time when we in the plant.
8.0	And the railway system become maturer than before and the trains are more comfortable than before.
8.0	So we will not worried about arrive a place too late and lose the mean during the vacation.
0.0	Finally, we have more money to buy the things more than the things too eat and we can buy things more convinient.
0.0	In my grantparents time, to feed themselves is the most important things because the society is very low and the production is very short.
0.0	But now the economic is very good and we have money to buy beautyful clothes and go to another place for a vacation.
0.0	We have more time to pursue the things we like.
0.0	And some app like Apple pay also let us could buy the things very quickly.
3.0	Because of the fast Economic development in Chinese, Many companies have to extend the working time so that many employees do not leave any space for their children.
3.0	Nowadays in the Weibo, it is a hot issue that which way is the best use of time for the busy parents spend with their children.
12.0	Many net friends think parents can have fun playing games and sports, others believe they can do something that are related to schoolwork.
5.0	As far as i am concerned, i think it is better for busy parents paly games and sports with children.
5.0	As a starter, it goes witout any doubts that playing more sports with children will make children healthier.
8.0	In China, Children have many drastic competes and it leads to too many homework and outschool class.
8.0	They have no time to have sports.
8.0	However it is bad for children to have long time to focus on computer screen, it must do harm to children's bodies and when children relax themseves, it will be more efficient for them to finish assignments.
8.0	So it ia necessary for parents to do more sports with children because of their health.
8.0	Also, it is more savety for parents to have fun playing sports with children, when they play sports with children, they do not worry about that the children will hurt theirselves.
7.0	However, it will inc
12.0	I agree that people today are more willing to help the struggling strangers.
8.0	For instance,more and more rich people  begin to donate their money to support the poor students finishing their school.
8.0	In China there are handreds of poor students get  kind help from many kind strangers every year.
8.0	As the journalists constantly report the hadship which many struggling strangers have gone through,people who are in the more comfortable state realize that they should give more to make the world a better place.
8.0	Lebron James who is one of the best basketball players in NBA has do a lot for a great many of struggling strangers.
8.0	He donates to poor schools in order to let kids study in the best classrooms and enjoy the best environmrnt.
8.0	Besides,he also stands out to give speaches for black people and help them to gain the rights.
8.0	living in the world today you find everyone is so kind that they hope to support other struggling people not only friends but also strangers.
8.0	In fact ,people are kind all the time from ancient time to today
3.0	From my point of view, mistakes make a person grow.
3.0	No one can avoid mistakes and it is mistakes that make people memorize for a long time.
12.0	So it is better for parents to allow their children to make mistakes and the most importantly, let them get experience from their mistakes.
5.0	We are not born to know, everyone grow up from a silly kid to a mature person.
8.0	It is common to make mistakes and every parent should not punish their children just because making mistakes.
8.0	We should be tolerent to each children and teach them mildly.
8.0	Circling from making mistakes and correcting mistakes let a person to improve.
5.0	It is human's natural ability to remember sorrows longer than happiness.
8.0	So does kids.
8.0	Children might forget that they were praised by their teacher but they would always remeber being punished to stand outside the classroom.
8.0	Instead of telling them what they should do, it is better to let them experience.
8.0	Only when they experience it by themselves can they really understand what is right and what is wrong, what bad effect a mistake will bring them.
8.0	For example, Helen Keller always lost her temper when she was young and once she broke her doll.
8.0	Her teacher said noting and just brought her out to enjoy the nature.
8.0	When she came back home, she took up her doll carefully and  said sorry to it and learnt not to push her own mood to others.
8.0	Even in the animals' world, mother fox will never help its grown up kid find food, it is not cruel but to help them suivive in the competitive world.
8.0	It is the same when it comes to human beings.
8.0	Mistakes help children learn for lifelong.
2.0	Making mistakes is a good method for children to grow up.
10.0	S
12.0	It is widely known that parents cares so much about their childrens' gardes in school that there is almost nothing they wouldn't do in order to obtain a higher score.
12.0	Thus, some of them would choose to give awards to children to encourage harder-working.
5.0	This is not a bad idea based on psychology researches.
8.0	Simple as it is, we usually expect something in return of our hard work.
8.0	Knowing that high grades does not necessarily attract all children, we need to provide them with something they want in trade of what we want from them.
8.0	"As far as I am concerned, this ""work-award"" system is much better than punishing them in circumstances where they fail to be distinguished."
8.0	After all,high grades are what we want from them, not necessarily what children value the most.
5.0	Agreeing that it is important to encourage children with rewards, it is inevitable to discuss the methods.
8.0	Money is flexible enough to be almost anything only when children can use them wisely.
8.0	We have to admit that there are criminals out there aiming at our children who do not have enough experience to help them tell honesty from lies.
8.0	Also, they may think that you don't care about them enough to spend time on getting to know their interests,or maybe just asking the question.
0.0	One solution is to find out what else you can give them in stead of money.
0.0	For example, supposing thst your child likes football, you could promise him a ticket to a football match, thus making it an award to his high grade and also a priceless chance to bound with him.
0.0	What is really important is to show that you care, not simply demanding something form them.
10.0	It is of course also vital to let them understand why you are doing all this and that you are always stiking together no matter what comes along.
11.0	To be honest, many parents will give thier children money when they get a high grade in school.
11.0	because of that they believe that is a effective way to arouse thier children's  passion to study harder.
11.0	but i don't agree this opinion.
12.0	i am also a student too, so i know the feeling of thier children .
11.0	the first time when thier children get the prize .
8.0	they will extremely happy , and they will build such opinion is i deserve .
8.0	because i get a great grades .
8.0	what's worse , they will use the money to play games and other things from which he can get forfile .
8.0	and they will addicted in those things and waste thier time in it .
6.0	From the other aspect, if you give your children money beacuse of they get a high grade in the school that would be change your children's mind .
8.0	they will lost themselves in this question .
8.0	why i need to study hard or i study just for the high grade and the money from parents?
8.0	obviously not .
8.0	as a parent you need to let your children build up a concept that i study iust for myself not for anyone , just to improve myself to enrich myself  to get an oppotunety .
8.0	an oppotunety for a better life for a job , enable to pay for school or put better things on the table .
2.0	now we are live in a colorful life .
8.0	because in the world have a lot of different empolyments ,  for example just like the cleaner or writer and so on .
8.0	even if they don't have a lot of knowlegement .
8.0	but they still give ue a wonderful experience to our life .
8.0	so different people has different selections .
8.0	it's impossible make everyone have the same goal to become a schoolar or scientist.
7.0	i think we should give money to them when thry get a high
3.0	It is a long-time controversial topic about whether leadership is gifted or learned.
3.0	It is said that some peole are born to be leaders, and that some people cannot grow up to be successful leader despite of elite edution.
3.0	Despite of all the examples taken by these people, I disagree with the argument that one cannot learn to be a leader.
11.0	Personally, I believe that one can become a leader with great effort and help from others.
5.0	First, one needs great effort to grow to be a leader.
8.0	Being a leader means great responsibility and better ability in some sense.
8.0	A leader should work hard enought to take the responsibility and gain corresponding ability.
8.0	For example, Zhu Yuanzhang, the first king of Ming dynasty, paid great effort to grow from a beggar to a king.
8.0	Being poor and uneduated, Zhu were accustomed to follow the orders of others.
8.0	It was the death of all his relaves that stimulated his awareness to be a leader.
8.0	He worked day and night to obtain knowledge and paid enormous efforts to be a sussessful leader.
8.0	It is not easy to be a leader, but leadership does't come naturally.
8.0	It requres hard work and great effort.
5.0	Second, growing to be a leader needs help from others.
8.0	Leadership asks for a group of people.
8.0	One needs help in the way to leadership.
8.0	Besides, a successful leader gain supports from other.
8.0	Jane, one of my pre-classmates, works as a management in a big company.
8.0	As a young girl, she was taught to get along with other and took specific responsibility.
8.0	Then, she worked as a moniter, helping teachers deal with class problems.
8.0	Her parents, teachers, classmates, and later her bosses play a significant part in her growth to be a leader.
8.0	Thus, help from others is an essential element to leadership.
2.0	All in all, leadership does not come naturally.
7.0	o
11.0	I think it is a good idea.
12.0	As we all know, a man work hard because of his reward.
11.0	When given a bonus or an expectation, one can develop his potential and struggle hard for the bonus.
10.0	Speaking back of the case, parents use money as a bonus for their chid to work hard for, which is as well a acceptable expectation for a child-that he can spend the money for whatever he want.
4.0	As i am concerned, I used to get this kind of bonus when i was little in a primary school.
8.0	I could get 100 yuan for each perfect mark-100 I recieved.
8.0	It was a great moivation for me at that time, so that it stimulated me a lot to make the money my own.
8.0	Then I got pretty good marks those days, which I have been proud of even till now.
4.0	Let us see another example.
8.0	People in cities may have a hobby to keep a pet.
8.0	Given example of a dog, what will we do to teach a dog how to sit?
8.0	"Surely one may say ""sit"" and make the dog at a right gesture and instantly feed him a piece of meat."
8.0	"Eventually the dog can get to know what he is supposed to do when hearing his owner saying ""sit"" and then the dog make a success in leraning sitting at his owner's will."
10.0	So is true in us humanity, one can hardly get in a studying mode without a specific motivation and on the other hand, when given a stimulation, man can burst out incredible potential to fullfil his wish like money rewarded by his parents.
4.0	Furthermore, the possession of an amount of money can train a child's skill of money planning as well.
9.0	It can gradually develop his sense of money spending.
9.0	It can help his growing as well.
2.0	To a nutshell ,I agree with the method of motivating children.
3.0	Society has been changed greatly since the advent of development of technology.
3.0	However, as technology brings many advantages for people, people also debate on wether it brings people more advantages or disadvantages.
11.0	In my opinion, people shouldn't pay too much attention to pick out its disadvantages and ignore the good.
12.0	And actually, technology has made children more creative than before.
5.0	Firstly, it's easy for children to come up with ideas with technology.
8.0	Because of technology, Internet and transport has been driven.
8.0	The possibilities of arriveing the places people want to go, the person they want to meet increase much more than the past.
8.0	Children can take flight to do research and communicate with people in another distant place.
8.0	The more they see, more creative they are.
8.0	In the past, they cannot access so much.
8.0	Therefore, they cannot put forward views naturally.
5.0	Secondly, children grow more creative because they can get more information in the present.
8.0	In the past, chhildren cannot get as much infoirmation as they want.
8.0	For instance, when a kid comes up with an idea in the past, they just can image instead of search for some massages about the idea.
8.0	However, the develop ment of internet technology effectively helps children with this aspect.
8.0	Children know more about the knowladge of their ideas so that they can develop their ideas further which benefits their creativity.
1.0	Futhermore, technology also helps children to achieve there imagnation.
1.0	In the past, children so not have conditions and money to realize what they want to create.
10.0	Nowdays,
11.0	I agree with the statement that it is better to relax by watching a mvie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.
12.0	Here are some of my opinions.
4.0	Living in such a competitive society,people are always busy with their study or work in order to create a better future or just to earn more money.
8.0	From adults to teenagers,it is very evident that they all have much stress.
8.0	Therefore,they are bond to relax themselves sometimes.
8.0	And I think watching a movie or reading a book may be more efficient.
4.0	Firstly,as is universally acknowleged,people will probably get exhausted after they fight for their lives and what they need is to relax wtihout taking their physical strength.
9.0	What if people choose to do physical exercise,they may be more tired and have no more energy to continue their formal work.
9.0	Consquently,watching a movie or reading a book in people's leisure time can help them store more energy and then get their work or study better.
4.0	Secondly,from my perspectives,watching a movie or reading a book to relax can give people more efficient comfort to their heart.
8.0	There is no denying that when people deal wtih something or get failure,they are likely to feel upset or even sometimes they may be lost in despair.
8.0	And at that time, a film or a book can give a hand to them.
8.0	On one hand,watching a film or reading a book can make their sadness fade away,on the other hand,it can give people more courage or confidence to overcome the difficulties and eventually acquire success.
1.0	In a word,watching a movie or doing physical exercsie can both get you relaxed,while watching a movie may be betterand more suitable.
1.0	And no mather  which one you choose,you are bond to remember to take 5-minute- break and then go on your work.
12.0	Currently, the controversial topic has aroused heated debate among people: is it more likely for young people today to improve the world than for young people at past.
12.0	Some claims that young people at past can endure difficulty so they are benefial for the world.
11.0	However, contrary to their view comes my perspective that it is the young people today devote more to the improvement of the whold world.
12.0	My point is well elaborated as follows.
5.0	To begin with, it is no doubt that the education level of contemperary youngsters are higher than before, which palys an important role in development of the whole world.
8.0	To be specific, the high level of education means that the young today might have plently of peoficiencies in all fields and better ability of learning and working.
8.0	As we all know, only when people utilize the knowledge more flexibly and full can more innovation be creacted.
8.0	With more and more new technology and concept come into being, people may find it easier to improve the whole society constanstly.
8.0	However, limited by the low quality of education and living standard, people in the past may not have sufficient knowledge and enery to create new thingd.
5.0	In addition, it is the competition of young people that are conducived to developing the world.
9.0	To illustrate, with more young people eagering to the decent and less position provided, people have to work harder and try their best to stand out.
9.0	Under this circumstance, youngsters might sacrifice more lesuie time to work, which means more production of the whole society.
7.0	In  constract, people at past usually have job through government deviding,
12.0	Facing the situation where we hold different opinions with our teachers, we are encouraged to consult with the latter after the class.
12.0	Based on what I have learned, I will wait until the class is over and others have gone, and then talk to my teacher, if what my teacher says is wrong in my opinions.
12.0	My reasons will be explained in the following paragraphes.
5.0	First, discussing my ideas with my teacher privately cannot only sovle my problem but also save her or his face.
8.0	If we have problems, they can only be tackled if we face them and talk about it.
8.0	Besides, we are often told to argue with others in an approriate manner, like in private place rather than a public place.
8.0	Several years ago, my mom, together with me, attended a kind of meeting aiming to promoting the communication between parents and teachers.
8.0	When my teacher talked something about my grades, he made a mistake about the mark.
8.0	I felt blue and wanted to cry.
8.0	I told my mom that what he said was incorrect.
8.0	My mom told me that my teacher would be sorry for making such a mistake, but we should told him after the meeting was over.
8.0	I felt terrible, but I followed her words anyway.
8.0	The following result defended my mom's words.
8.0	Therefore, telling your opinions to your teachers or leaders privately will lead to a happy ending.
5.0	Second, interrupting and correcting the mistake immediately will disturb the class or meeting and harm teachers' face.
8.0	When I was a middle school student,  we had chemical experiment classes.
8.0	One day, our chemistry teacher made a small mistake, that is he forgot to wash a jar.
8.0	I poped up and said that he forgot it.
8.0	My teacher was so embarrassed and I felt sorry about it.
8.0	From then on, I learned that we should take into consideration others' feelings, even though we are right.
0.0	Third, saying nothing will make us confusing during learning.
0.0	My cousin is a very shy boy with excellent English accent.
0.0	The strange thing is that he cannot get a good grade in the primary school.
9.0	He said that he knew that many English words pronunced by his English teacher was incorrect.
9.0	However, he dared not to speak to his teacher about it.
7.0	With time going on, he losed his interest in learnin
3.0	Recently, an interesting topic has aroused heated debate among people: in order to attract tourists, is it good for the government to improve the safety by hiring more police or improve the appearance by improving the old buildings and streets?
3.0	Answers vary from person to person.
3.0	Some cliam that it is the best idea for government to attract tourists.
11.0	However, I would stand on the opposite side and I am firmly believe that this two suggestions are not beneficial for city's tourists.
12.0	And some reasons and examples given below can illustratre my point of view.
4.0	Firstly, hiring more police is not good for tourists.
9.0	For one thing, we all know that hiring more new police would take more money containg training activities, take new uniforms stuff and their salaries, thereore it is not the best way for the government's finance.
9.0	Moreover, if there have more police stand on the most streets, it would seems serious rather than easy, but most people want have an relaxing vacation.
4.0	Second, improving the old streets and the building are destroy the tourists.
8.0	What the treasure of one tourist city  are the old buildings and streets.
8.0	This unique places are the intertesting of the visitors.
8.0	If the government improve the appearance by improving the old streets, the visitors would go out and the city would lost the valuable things of the tourist.
4.0	Third, the government can improve the safety and theappearance by another ways.
9.0	Such as they can fix many camera in the public that stand on the secrets.
9.0	And they can also improve moral sense of the local people such as do not throw rabbish in the public.
1.0	To put it in the nutshell, I think the two ways is not good for the tourists that is not noly because of hiring more police is expensive but also because of the old streets and building is precious for one city.
1.0	And we can use better way to improve the city that being a good tourist place.
11.0	When it comes to the better relaxation way, I would contend that we should stay outside and doing physical exercise.
11.0	So I disagree with this statement.
11.0	The reasons that account for my opinion are as follows.
5.0	To begin with,there are disadvantages about watching movies or reading books.
8.0	As a student,I will have to spend a large amount of time to stay in the classroom and study.
8.0	But if I still choose to sit there when relaxing,which is relatively easy comparing with doing physical exercise.
8.0	To some degree,it is not a kind of relax.
8.0	In order to keep the balance of the body,we should do some exercise physically and metally.
8.0	So here are the advantages of doing physical exercise,for not only can we get fresh air outside,but also we can sweet and expell the toxin in our body.
8.0	More importantly,we will be more energetic when we get back to work.
8.0	But in comparsion with watching a movie or reading a book,we will be more tired and under great pressure by taking this kind of relaxation.
8.0	So this is the difference between these different ways of relaxation.
5.0	For chinese students,it is necessary for our to do physical exercise rather than watching and reading.
8.0	It is not exaggerated to say that we are lacking in exercise in our daliy life with heavy study work.
8.0	In the recent years,the healty of Chinese students is decreasing,which has bought a lot of concern to it.
8.0	So as far as I am concerned,enough attention should be paid to this problem and measures should be taken.
8.0	For the government they should advocate more students to get involved in physical exercise,and improve the quality of the exercise equipment.
8.0	And for our students and other people,we should be more considerd about our healty.
1.0	In conclusion,doing physical exercise is the best way for us to relax ourselves.
1.0	Only we more and more people aware of this can they strenthen this body while having a good relaxation.
3.0	Have you ever met some people who have a really good grades, but the relationship between them and their classmates are not so good?
3.0	Have you ever met some people who have numerous friends but their grades are  ladding?
3.0	Many parents prefer the former statement.
11.0	However, from my perspective, the latter students always have brighter future than the former students, because I think if you want to success in a future job, the ability to relate well to people is more important than study hard at school.
5.0	Firstly, the friends you have made in school would have great benefits when you have a job.
8.0	Especially some jobs are related to social network to attain profits.
8.0	Take my cousin for example, she was well known when she was in high school, and she made lots of friends.
8.0	When she grew up and became an bussinessman, she recommended her product to her classamates, and because of the classmates belief to my cousin, she gained various fixed customers, and the consciousness of losing customers decreased a lot.
5.0	In addition, the more friends you have in school could help you solve more problems.
8.0	Differnent people have their differnet own exellent skills.
8.0	And if we have some trouble in some area, we certainly need some friends who are adept of it to help us solve the problem instead of Differnent people have their differnet own exellent skills.
8.0	And if we have some trouble in some area, we certainly need some friends who are adept of it to help us solve the problem instead of facing it by yourself.
0.0	Finally, although studing hard is really important to students, because this is the basic skills for you to success.
0.0	However, the ability to relate well to people is a basic skills for your life.
0.0	Even if your academic skills are really superb, if you are unable to relate well with others, nobody are willing to contact with you.
0.0	Therefore, there are more and more companies embrace the people who are good at communicating with others instead of just have a high academic level.
0.0	So it is really essential for students to develop this good ability when they are for their future job.
11.0	In China,parents always tell their children what is right and wrong ,what they should do to achieve their goals before they do it , children could avoid making mistakes and find the shortest way.
11.0	However,in western countries,parents always let their children go and tell them what is right and wrong after they do it.
11.0	In my point of view,parents should let their children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.
12.0	Here are the reasons.
6.0	Let children make mistakes when they are young can be a great forturn for their future.
9.0	For it will be more clearly for them to remember if they had done it once before.
9.0	Therefore,they will not make the same mistake if they had suffered from the bad results brought by the mistake.
0.0	They will know how to settle the same problem next time if their parents introduce them to learn from the mistakes .
0.0	Making mistakes does not matter, what you learn from the mstake matters a lot.
0.0	Children will have much more confidence if they find ways to aviod the mistake by their own.
3.0	Nowadays, some parents award their kids with money for good marks their children win at school.
3.0	Whether it is a good idea is under the debate.
3.0	I firmly believe that high grade should never be equal to money.
3.0	If children receive money only because of their acdamic performance at school, they may regard the purpose of studying as to win money and awards in a quick way.
3.0	Hence they will underestimate other virtues they ought to poccess.
11.0	What is more, acdamic perfomances may not win them awards and fame in their future carrer if they are involved in the field of science.
11.0	There is potensial risk that they will spare no means to accelerate this process, which can sometimes be illegal.
5.0	Also, it is essencial that a child should learn that he is studying for himsilf rather than anyone else.
9.0	If he only works for awards in his childhood, he will feel confused in the future when he finds that there are no longer clear goals.
9.0	This is the inevitable consequence of wrong education.
5.0	Some people may argue that award children with monry can motivate children to work harder effienctly.
8.0	I think they have overlook the problems.
8.0	Money may work now, but the trick won't last long.
8.0	At a young age, we should urge children to go through the experinces which are eccential.
8.0	Or it will pay back in the long term.
0.0	Overall, right parenting is of great importance.
0.0	While parents are focusing on the good grade their children get, they should also pay attention to their children's psychological development.
0.0	Kids need to gain their self-assessment and goals for lifetime through experinces anmd frustrations.
0.0	So parents ought to by long-sighted rather than stick to the grade their children get.
7.0	Hopefully every parent will raise children who live with satisfaction,
3.0	In the rapid developing society, the opinions of people and also the rules of society have been changed alot.
12.0	Therefore, there are some scolars holds the opinion that the regulations for young people today are too strict.
12.0	As far as I concerned, however, the rules for youngs today is comparative less strict.
5.0	To begin with, young people have more rights and chances to decide their future and their life.
8.0	Because of the thrive of technology and edcation development, most of young people are university students or higher which is highly educated.
8.0	So they possess higher horizen and knowledge that is really useful when they decide their work.
8.0	In contrast, people in the past were lack of important information and money, so it is really hard for them to obtained high quality edcation.
8.0	As a result, there were only limited chocies for them when they were the age of working because they were not fit the basic requirement of the work which they liked.
8.0	So it is obvious that young people are less strict today since they are free on choosing they work.
5.0	Moreover, young people today can be considered less strict by the aspect of choosing mate.
8.0	In the nowadays society, all of the young people are allowed to dress up as they wish without any restrict, and they are able to pursue anyone.
8.0	However, this concept might seems ordinary but in the fifty years ago, people are not allow to have free love.
8.0	In China for instance, parents always chose husband for their daughter following they own opinion with any idea from their daugher.
8.0	And also, homsexuality are definitely inhibitant at that time, those people with homsexuality relationship will be put into death by the local people and there were no policy to protect them.
10.0	Indeed
3.0	Books and movies consist of most of our means of entertainment.
3.0	And since the competiton of the society is becoming more fierce, more and more peolple are inclined to relax by these means.
3.0	When being asked whether it is better to ralx by watching a movie or reading a book than by doing phiscal exercise, different people have different ideas.
3.0	From my perspective, I feel inclined to relax by watching a movie or reading a book.
12.0	My reasons are listed below.
5.0	Firstly, as we read the books or watch movies, we will indulge ourselves to the world created by the author or director and be endowed with a temporary detachment with the bothering cuurent sictuation.
8.0	Stories nowdays are so appealing thta we can hardly resist the temptation to take a glimpse of it even when we are loaded with tons of pressure.
8.0	And many books or movies not only privide wonderful stories but also offer inspiring ideas which can benefit people a lot.
8.0	And for instance, thousands of white collars will take going  to the theater to see the newest blockbuster as the best relaxation after a nine-to-five work.
8.0	Accordingly, I think books and movies help people relieve pressure effectively.
5.0	Secondly, books and movies are readily available, therefore it is convenient for people to choose them to be the means of relaxasion.
8.0	Since the techonology is well-developed now, we can get every book or movie we desire from the internet, No matter how old the book is, or which country the film producer coms from.
8.0	And our booming ecnomy give a propulation to the development of theaters.
8.0	Imagine, after coming back home, we can have a bathe and meanwhile enjoy a brilliant moive.
8.0	How glad and relarxed that experience may be!
8.0	On the contrary, sometimes it is comletely inconvenient for us to do some kind of sports.
8.0	For example, we can not run outdoor if it rains or if it is foggy.
8.0	However, buying a big and heavy running machine and put it home may take up most of the area of your bedroom.
8.0	While reading a book or watching a movie only require a phone or a computer.
8.0	Therefore, these two means seems more convenient.
0.0	To put it a nutshell, If want to choose a good means to help us relieve pressure, effect、budget and convenience should be the key reasons taken into consideration.
0.0	Reading books or watching a movie will indulge your in anthor world and forget about the current bothering affairs.
0.0	And it is much more convenient than doing physical some exercise.
0.0	So why not try this effective and easy way to rest for a while?
11.0	I don't agree the statement that people are more willing to help others who are in trouble.
11.0	There are three main reasons that can prove my view.
11.0	First, we have to think about why somebody think people are more willing to help the struggling strangers.
12.0	In my opinion, that's because we see more phenomena of somebody helps strangers who was in trouble than before.
11.0	I think that's not because people give more help, but we could know more than we used to be.
8.0	So that should be given the credit to the development of communication technology.
8.0	The more we have  seen, the more we think people are more willing to help others.
8.0	I believe people are willing to help others like what they were before.
5.0	Second, I think helping others is a kind of significant quality in every culture.
8.0	Though the cultures are keeping imporving, some good tradition will not have any changed.
8.0	Just like in Asia culture, kids are told to be willing to help others since they were born.
8.0	The adult in the familiy will teach the children always be enthusiastc to others because there will be a day that we will need help from others like what we do to others before.
5.0	Last but not least, I may think people are more willing to help others in the old days.
8.0	On many media station on the internet like Youtube, there are many social experiment, and most of these experiment shows that people are busier than before because the beat of modern society are too fast.
8.0	Most of people just passed away with their head down when thay see someone needs help.
8.0	We can't blame on them because help or not it's their right, and they need to protect themselves more than before because the terrorism are becoming more and more serious in thede days.
2.0	So that's way I don't agree the statement that people today are more willin to help the strugging strangers.
3.0	In this information age, we can easily get access to various information from different sources.
3.0	Some old and reserved gentlemen may prefer obtaining information from print media, like books or newspapers.
3.0	As a young man, I get used to receiving information from different sources including electronic media, like TV, or Internet.
5.0	For one thing, we will devote oursevles to thinking deeply with print media.
8.0	With a newspaper or a book, we will take more seriously what we are reading, which will provoke our thinking.
8.0	When I was in high school, I found it really hard to build a composition.
8.0	Faced with the title of a compositon, I did not know whether I should agree or disagree with it, since I had no evidence to support my idea.
8.0	To be honest, I did not have an idea.
8.0	I was suggested to read newspapers and then share the contents with my classments.
8.0	Listening their comments about the newspaper, I learn to view the newspaper in a critical way.
8.0	I learnt to analyze the causes and results of an event.
8.0	Thus, getting information from print media is a good way to gain critical thinking ability.
5.0	For another, we can get up-to-date news from electronic media.
8.0	If one is reluctant to be cut off from the outside world, he or she should keep pace with the latest news, which are often provided by electronic media.
8.0	In one of our English class, we were asked to share our knowledge about foreign culture.
8.0	We worked in group.
8.0	Our group chose the United States.
8.0	Somehow, we mentions the differences in politics in China and America.
8.0	"When my peers mentioned Trump, I asked a silly question: ""Who is Trump?"""
8.0	I was so embrassed.
8.0	From then on, I started to learn some lastest news, even though I did not adore any international news.
8.0	Therefore, we can gain up-to-date news to keep pace with our peers with assistance of electronic media.
1.0	Admittedly, absorbing information from various news sources may be time-consuming, whereas it can improve our time management and boost our time efficiency.
1.0	In the past, I spent too much time in searching for news.
12.0	These days, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people: whether colleagues or classmats should communicate in person or through emails to do a project better.
11.0	From my perspective, communicating in person is a better choice.
12.0	My point will be elaborated as follows.
5.0	Firstly, communicating in person is conductive to improving the efficiency of doing the projects.
8.0	It is largely due to the fact that colleagues and classmates can discuss with each other and share the different opinions with each other, resulting that everyone can have a complete overview of the project.
8.0	Moreover, sitting together and communicating in person can guarantee that they can solve the new aroused problems and make sure that they go towards a correct direction.
8.0	On the contrary, if the colleagues and classmates use emails to communicate, they cannot receive and send emails in time because they may concentrate on the other stuffs, which would delay the process of solving the project.
8.0	For example, I took part in a project targeting at environment probles with my classmates.
8.0	We shared viewpoints through emails, sending materials to each other.
8.0	However, it turned out that we used three days to just finish the first step.
8.0	So we changed our communicating methods and discussed  with each other in person in the team-work room.
8.0	It is no wonder that we finsihed the project in just two day with everyone find reference and solve the problems immediately in a limited time.
5.0	Secondly, communicating in person can help colleagues and classmates understand the project further.
8.0	With everyone sitting together, they can discuss the project and find the hidden meaning of the key points resulting a better understanding of the concepts.
8.0	Solving the difficult tasks and sharing the methods to have easier access to the projects, they can clarify the misunderstanding and think further towards the projects.
8.0	On the other hand, the emails messages may cause misunderstanding because they cannot explain the tasks with so much words.
8.0	For example, a research conducted by Harvard University shows that teamwork especially the communicating in person with others can have a positive effects in solving the most difficult tasks.
2.0	All in all, communicating in person is a better choice.
3.0	Nowadays, a controverisal topic about teachers' income has aroused attentions among the people from evey walk of life.
3.0	Some people think that teachers' income is too high, which may cause financial burden for school.
12.0	However, I think teacher should be paid as leat as much as some decent professionals like doctors, lawyers or bussiness leaders.
6.0	First, there is no doubt that teacher is the one of the most important role in society.
8.0	This is because they can impart their knowledge and life experience to students, who may be devoted themselves to the society and construct their home.
8.0	For example, Tao Xingzhi ,the famous teacher in China has taught about 20 years in the high school.
8.0	Many of his students learned a lot of knowledge from him, which lay a good foundation for their future study.
8.0	When the students finished their advanced education in the university, most of them dedicated their whole life to the New China construction, such as Dun Jiaxian ,a famous scientist found nuclear fission which made the nuclear power plants come true in China.
8.0	If our society give teachers more payment, it is safe to say that many good teacher as well as Mr Tao will be found because there will be more young people to oocupy in professional as teacher.
1.0	Second, high salary may make teacher more absorb themselves in teaching.
1.0	To illustrate, with high salary,teachers will not consider  basic life essensials like buying houses and tuitions of children.
8.0	So they may consentrate all their energy to teach.
8.0	For example, there are some teachers in remote area of China.
8.0	Everyday, they have to some part-time jobs to susutain their life.
7.0	As a result, they will have little time to prepare for teaching mater
12.0	Nowadays, people like to concern more about their stars who are famous entertainers and athletes than concern about themselves.
12.0	Sometimes, if some entertainers or athletes get marride or they have a baby, people might be so crazy about these things.
12.0	Some of fans are even so hurtful, and they might feel themselves lose their spirit support and they don't trust love or anything else.
11.0	So in my opinion, I agree with the opinion that famous entertainers and athletes deserve to have more privacy.
4.0	First and foremost, even famous entertainers and athletes are just humans.
8.0	As a person, every one will get marry with other people and they will have their own bady.
8.0	Maybe they have a bad memory of their childhood or something else.
8.0	And these things are their destiny, they need to go through that.
8.0	They are the same as us.
8.0	They are just have their own major which make them so popular in the world.
8.0	For example, like China movie star YuhaoMIng, he had a bad destiny when he filmed and he was hurt by fire.
8.0	Because of this, he didn't have great appearence any more.
8.0	And some of people weren't feel pity for him and cheat with him which made him so sad.
4.0	What's more, with the development of the Internet, the public opinion sometime are so hurrible.
10.0	Nowadays, if famous entertainers and athletes got hurt by something, people are just think it is fake and they don't believe them, sometimes these things will hurt them so that they might be disease by these things.
4.0	However, famous entertainers and athletes have their a large amount of fans.
8.0	And they are fans want to have a closed distance with their stars, so they want to know their privacy.
8.0	But I think these famous people need to deserve to have more privacy.
8.0	In some certain, this will they protect themselves.
2.0	In a nutshell, I think famous people need more privacy.
3.0	I don't think that parents offer their childern money for each high grade they get in school.
3.0	Many parents send their their children to school is in order to gets more kownledge in school and their children will lean a variety of kownledge that parents couldn't teach their children.
12.0	To begin with,in my opinion, parents give us chances to school is not a easy thing and they need to afford our highly tuition and daily consumption.
12.0	Getting a great grade in shcool is our responsibility and goals to repay our parents.
8.0	What is more, I believe that giving money to your children not only simulate your children study hard, but also bing a bad effect.
8.0	In the one hand, they migth think that study is equal to money and they just study to eran money.
8.0	In the other hand, imagining that your children get a lot of money, they maybe buy many games and paly with their friends or buy some clothes they wanted.
8.0	And their won't pay more attention to their study.
8.0	So I recommend that parents should give a prize which include your heart and care to your children.
8.0	I received that prize when I got high grade in middlie shcool.
8.0	It was a note book that is very good and I used it to noted my mistakes.
8.0	So I think that prize like my note book is very well to your children.
8.0	To illustrate, hunging out with your children to see their favorite moives or buy their clothes they like.
8.0	All of them are good ways.
2.0	All in all, offering money not a good way to reware your children.
3.0	The education is very impoetant for us.
12.0	Some people think that improving the quality of education, the universities should spend more money for professor, but some people believe that universities shouldn't spend more money for the professor, because they think that universities should spend more money on student.
11.0	Personally, I belive that universities can spend more money on salaries for the professor, because it can let professor focus on students.
4.0	To begin with, universities can hire more professor to teach the students.
9.0	Hiring more professor is benefit for student to study, because they can not worry about many students to find the professor, professor is not enough.
9.0	For example, Mark has a math question want to ask the professor, he go to his professor's office to ask help, but in his professor's office have many students, at this time he can find other professor to solve his problem.
4.0	Secondly, univerties can sent the professor to learn high level education, this way the professor can tackle the difficult problem for the student.
9.0	For instance, before sent the professor to learn high level education, the professor just can solve some simple problems, but when students meet some problems that very challenged, the professor doen't have approach to help them.
9.0	However, the professor have high level education, they can fix some difficult problems for their students.
4.0	Lastly, univerties can spend money to build a domintory, let the professor live in the school, it is convience for the professor to help the students.
10.0	For example, if the professor live in the school, the student have any problems, they find the professor fast than before, and can save the time for the student to doing other work.
1.0	All in all, some people think univerties should spend more money for the professor, but some people doesn't think that.
1.0	I think that univert
3.0	There is growing tendency that people begin to pay more attention on the education their offspring will accept.
3.0	And one of  the hot topics is the cooperation projects.
3.0	Whether the projects on which students work together is more beneficial when compared with projects just involving a single person?
3.0	As far as I am concerned, working alone is more educational for students.
11.0	And following are my reasons.
6.0	First of all, working alone is more efficient for students to bring what they have learnt from the class into the realistic condition, such as the offices in the work place or the factory.
8.0	The theories are useless if the students just read books, attend lectures and rely on their parters when faced with the real difficulities.
8.0	Working alone will force them to rely on themselves, which is more beneficial and educational.
8.0	For example, one of my classmates, who has not worked hard, will turn to other students to cooperate with him, when face with a challenging project.
8.0	It is surperising how Rare knowledge he can get Secondly, for the company and employee, evaluing the ability of working alone is an important part in the interview of the students who just graduate from the university.
8.0	So being able to and being familiar to work alone is precious for students in the competition of the labor market.
8.0	As you can imagine,the employees must have a special preference for fewer employers because the small number of employers always means the low cost for the company.
8.0	What's more, they are also willing to get the assistance from a single employee who can work as efficiently as a grounp.
2.0	There is no doubt that the cooperation is also helpful in the course and assignment for students.
8.0	Because they can learn to communite with other students and make some friends.
8.0	Nevertheless, in the serious accadamical projects, the unexperienced students are very like to regard the cooperation as idol chatting so that they cannot focus on the projests.
8.0	And in students' spare time, it is more convinient to make friends without taking up the studying time.
8.0	So it is better for the students to work alone.
3.0	Have you travelled in a group with a tour guid?
3.0	Did think they make no sense?
3.0	I have travelled Mountain Yellow in a group with a tour guide, but I think they tell us things that we can search on the internet and urge us to use money on souvernirs that are expensive but we do not need.
11.0	Therefore, I do not think it is the best way to travel in a group with a tour guide.
12.0	There is a couple of specific facets why I think in this way.
5.0	Initially, tour guides always are not the good vehicles for transferring value imformation to us when we go sightseeing.
8.0	This is because they tell us the information that we can get from the internet.
8.0	For instance, when my families went for a trip in Mountain Yellow, we wanted to know the information about local falks about the interests.
8.0	But the guide in our group just introduce some basic information about this mountaion, such as its history.
8.0	However, if we only need to know the history, we can search on the internet, but want to know entique or fanny informations about the local people.
8.0	Hence, we thought it is not worthwhile to travel with a guides.
5.0	Moreover, guides often introduce their tourists to the store with much more expensive souvernirs than the nomal stores have.
8.0	This is the way that help them make benefits from cheating tourists with the store owners.
8.0	For example, when we wanted to by some souvernirs for our friends, the guides introduced us to an expensive store with some normal articles that we can buy in our city.
8.0	We were angry when we found out that.
8.0	Thereby, guides are almost not kind.
1.0	Even though guides can help people find their way to the sightseeing sites, I still hold fast on my idea that guides cannot do much more things to help us than we think so, and I think that people can do what guides do by themselves, if they make plants carefully.
1.0	Taking account all the factors mentioned above, we may safely arrive the conclusion that it is not the best way to travel in a group with a tour guides.
3.0	It is crutial to think about wheather shoud we protect enviornment with a large amount of money.
3.0	And I believe the answer should be yes.
3.0	In contemporary society, the wild animals and wilderness ares are decreasing over time.
3.0	Species extinguish in ever hour.
12.0	If people don't put any effort on enviornment protection, then after few decates we have nothing to do because maybe human is the only living animal at that time.
5.0	Protecting wild animals and wilderness areas are critic because is a precious preasent for every one.
8.0	When I was a kid, my father always took me to forest.
8.0	We observed the different kinds of plants, mimic the sound of birds, and we even took some mushrooms back to home and used them to cook delicious food.
8.0	I spended very great time at there and also learned a lot of knowledge through this experience that no one can teach me at school.
8.0	When I grown up, I realized this experience have a long-term influence on me such as the dream to become a biologist.
8.0	However if the wild animals and wilderness area are keep declining and people do nothing to prevent that, children in the future have no opportunities to feel the same feeling I had.
8.0	They can only recognize variaty animal from textbook.
8.0	This phnomenon is already happening now.
8.0	Some kids never saw the real fish so they believe the fish was born with out bones just like sushi.
5.0	Moreover, protecting enviornmrnt is the only way which can help human figure out who we are, and this question is the most basic and most dificult problem in human history.
8.0	In the past, people assume that human are created by God.
8.0	However, the evolutionism casts doubt on this view.
8.0	It contends that human are the offspring of primitive animals.
8.0	And many scientists are working hard to provive this theory is reliable.
8.0	However, if the wild animals like monkeys and apes are all extinct, we lost the evidence to reserch and prove the theory.
7.0	All in all, protect wild animals and wilderness areas are crucial because these reasons I listed
12.0	I think it is a good idea to reward children money for their high grade.
12.0	In my opinon,rewarding chilren money can be a good motivation for them,allowing them to know that the good hard working will gain you what you want which is really practicle in real life,and if not reward children after their hard work,it can some times destory a child's passion to study.
5.0	Turther more,rewarding children with money  with a right guiediance,they will be learning how to deal with their money by their own,this will therefore,teach them how to manage their own life which most of student lack with normol education.
5.0	Lastly,letting children with some money in the poket can solve some incident ,like helping peple who is homless which cam teach children about kindness,or setting party for their friends and develop better ralationships among them.
10.0	While children without the concept of using money will only know to relly on their parents.
3.0	Currently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among students: Young people in the past did not have as much time to invest in improving the world as the do today.
3.0	Opinions vary from person to person, some claim that the people in the past is more likely to invest their time and efforts in improving the world.
11.0	However, contrary to their view comes my perspective that todays people is more likely to improving the world.
11.0	My point can be elaborated as follows.
5.0	First of all, since education is better, more students have access to political issues, so more political talents will be created for the country.
9.0	To be more specific, in the past, education had limited resources, so people can have access to more education resources, and create more talents more talents for the country, to help the country achieve better goals.
9.0	For example, i want to learn when i was in junior middle school politics, but because of all the mot basic courses taught in the school, such as chinee maths and english, so i did not have a chance to contact with politics, but when i went to high school, here are many courses i can choose, so i chose politics, because i hope that i can go to political work after graduation.
5.0	Secondly, because the current techology is developed, people can see more national news, so they will attract some students to learn ways to improve the country.
9.0	To be more specific, in the past, it was impossible for young people to get in touch with national news.
9.0	Even the
3.0	With the development of society, nowadays more and more people are educated than before, and that is all because of the hard work of the teachers.
3.0	Now there is a hot debate about whether the teachers now are more appreciated by society or not.
11.0	Some people might say yes that teachers are being more appreciated than before.
11.0	However, in my opinion, the teachers nowadays are not much appreciated than the past time.
4.0	First, teachers'status are much lower than the past.
8.0	As we all know, in the past time of China, especially the 19th centuary, there were only a few teachers.
8.0	The people who were educated at that time were admired by the iliterate people or the most of the people who were farmers.
8.0	If someone else got the education certificate, the whole village would celebrate.
8.0	As you can imagine, the teacher who have high edcational dioploma will definetely gain the respect of other people.
8.0	The status of the teacher at that time is superior than the normal people.
8.0	For instance, my grandma's mother was a teacher, at that time she used to recevied lots of respect like complaints and gifts.
8.0	But now my cousin who is also a teacher, she needs to apologize for she misses the message that sended 2 minutes ago from the student's mother.
4.0	Second, the salaries of the teacher is much lower than the past time.
8.0	If the money of past teacher converts to nowadays accurancy, it will be much more than the teachers' salaries now.
8.0	That is simply because there are too many teachers now and the subsidy from the government is too limited.
8.0	The teachers now cannot even buy the products easily bacause of their poor salary.
8.0	For instance,  my grandma' mother used to have 500 RMB at that time, that converted to nowadyas currency is almost 20000 RMB.
8.0	But my cousin who is also the teacher nowadays, she can only have 2000 RMB salary, which is not enough for the daily purchase, and she needs to do the part time job to support her life.
4.0	I admit that some people might say the teacher teaches us the infomation which will be the prerequisite of success.
8.0	And the people now are more aware of the eduacation than before.
8.0	So the teachers now is more appreciated than the past.
8.0	However, teachers now do not have the deserved respect, they get rebuke from the students's parents if they do not do exactly that parents want them to do, and get unfair punishment just because the students who do not behave.
8.0	Teachers now are not truly appreciated they are actually discriminated.
2.0	To conclude, I  agree that  the teacher is more appreciated and valued than now.
3.0	Nowadays, as the developement of the education and the technology, the competition in the school become more and more intense and many teachers and parents think giving students proper rewards such as money is a very good way for them to study hard and it's one of the most important goals for the students.
11.0	From my opinion, I don't think it is a good way to encourage students to study hard.
5.0	Firstly, giving students money if they succeed will make them think that money can do everything, they will fight for money instead of other more important things, they will only know that money can make me study harder so money can make others do anything, mayby they will use money to do some bad things, and also, if a student can use a lot of money when he is at a very young age, he will not know other more important things, he will not know love, health, family, friends...
10.0	these many things are more and more important than money.
5.0	In addition, although giving students money can let them study harder for higher grades but they can't have a clear target, they will not know if they are studying for money or for their own future.
10.0	They will love money instead of the knowledge, they will not get happiness for study, they can't experience failure so that they can't understand, if they can't get good grades from exams and they can't have money, they will complain they can't have money instead of thinking about themselves why they can't get good grades.
7.0	All in all, I think offering students for each high grade they get is not a good way to encourage them to study harder, they will not realize what they are studying for and also, it will make them become more greedy
3.0	In the developing country,the education is every important to their parents.
3.0	Some parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade (mark) they get in school.
12.0	But the other parents think it is not a good idea to achievement the childrens' future.
4.0	When you offer their school-age children money for each high grade (mark) they get in school,the children will have the different ways to resist to do it.
8.0	And they will avoid the problem when they face to face the difficult  ies.
8.0	When the children study in school,they will depend on their teachers or parents to solve the thing.
8.0	Theremore,they will not think about or do something by themself.
8.0	However,a little children can accept it.
4.0	For example,my little sister,who awlays study hard in school.
8.0	Her parents do not offer her shool-age child money for each high grade (mark) she gets in school.
8.0	When she was join in the exam,she offen gets excerllent grades.
8.0	In school,she is clever and smart girl,that many schoolmates like her,and make good friends to her.
4.0	Finally,different parents have different idea to it.
10.0	S
3.0	Do you like history?
3.0	Do you think history is essential?
3.0	Whether will you choose hostory?
3.0	And do you think hostory is meaningful?
12.0	From my perspective, I will choose history whether what my field is, because learning history can not only help me be familiar with my own country's history, but also let myelf to have a more mighty heart..
6.0	Learning history can enrich my knowledge about my own country's ancient feature.
8.0	If a person who do not know her country's history, she may be laughed by others and redarded as a unpatriotic person.
8.0	Take my elder sister as an example.
8.0	After she enters her college, she gives up history, because it is extremely difficult to recite all the stories.
8.0	But when she studys abroad, she cannot share anything about her own country's histiry with her foreign friends and what she can do is just to listen to other country's history.
8.0	And all the friends slowly leave her thinking she is a person without any knowledge.
8.0	She becomes lonely and unhappy.
8.0	From her own experienced story, I realize that hostory is a really significant subject.
8.0	And whatever what our fields are, we cannot give up it.
8.0	Hence, I think all universities students should be required to take history courses.
1.0	Indeed, learning history need a bunch of time, but we can become more strong and bravely after we learn it.
1.0	You may feel strange why learn history can let a person have a mighty mind.
8.0	Let me take myself as an example.
8.0	When I was a student in junior high scholl, we have the choice whether to stufy hisory.
8.0	Luckily, I choose it and now I am a girl with full cnfidence.
8.0	During the time I laerned history, I was proud of my own country.
8.0	And I was deeply affected by some heroes and authors in the ancient time.
8.0	In order to change our country, those people dared to speak out their thoughts bravely.
8.0	They will not be influended by the bad guys and the bad government.
8.0	What they do is to use thier blood and motivation to help all the citizens get rid of the bad society and tried their best to change our country.
7.0	And at last, they do it, today's China is really s
11.0	Recentlly a controversial topic has aroused a hated debate among people whether movies and television have more negative effects than positive effects on the way young people behave.
11.0	Some people claim that movies and television have more negative effects than positive effects on the way young people behave.
11.0	However I would stand on their opposite and I believe that movies and television have more positive effects than negative effects on the way young people behave.
10.0	My reasons can be seen as follows:
5.0	First of all, movies and television can teach young people many knowledges.
8.0	As we all know, movies and television programs base on the real life, so they have many life knowledges, which can teach young people many knowledges.
8.0	And some TV programs even project for children such as follow me and so on.
8.0	For example.
8.0	when I was a high school stuent, I realy hated history, because I think it is so boring.
8.0	One day, I watched a TV program named small class about history.
8.0	It attached my atteation.
8.0	The program make the history become many interesting story with many humous speaking.
8.0	I felt interesting, and watched it everyday.
8.0	At the end of this semester, I suddently found I like history, and I get good history grades.
5.0	What's more, movies and television can release young people stress.
8.0	As we all know, all of us have much stress when we live in the world.
8.0	The children is as well, and they do not have many ways to release stress like adults such as smoking, drinking and so on.
8.0	So movies and television provide a good way to release our stress.
8.0	For example, when I was a child, I realy liked watching TV.
8.0	When I leave school and back home at Friday, I would watch TV to release the stress accumulated in the week.
8.0	I felt happy and had the confidence to face the next week and the weekend homwork.
10.0	In a nutshell, I think movies and television have more positive effects than negative effects on the way young people behave.
2.0	Because movies and television can teach young people many knowledges and release young people stress.
3.0	Have you ever felt that your history or political teachers are really likely to express their social or political views in class?
11.0	Many peers of mine sometimes complain to me that they just want to learn new things and do not want to hear their teachers' perspective, it is really waste of time.
12.0	And I really endorse this idea.
5.0	Firstly, students need to learn things objective.
8.0	Provided that teachers illustrates their opinion after they inculcating a kind of unfamilliar knowledge, students would remember more about their teachers' opinion toward one thing rather than the thing itself.
8.0	To illustrate, the class is about industry revolution.
8.0	If teacher tells students that he thinks the impact of industry revoultion is more detrimental because people emitted much toxic atmosphere in the air, and gave earth big pollution.
8.0	After class, students probably remember the perspective of their teacher insread of the conception or the event.
8.0	Because it is so boring, and teacher is a more relative person to them, so some subjective things are easily to remember.
8.0	When they are in their rest of the life, they would finally misrepresent the events, and the knowlege.
5.0	In addition, students need to have their own perspective for the first place.
8.0	Like the previous example,not only the students would easily forget the events itself, but they would like to have a simillar opinion like their teachers.
8.0	One reseach demonstrates that 70 percent of students' opinion are simillar with their teachers.
8.0	When students are in the argument part of this events, they have arguments based on their teachers' opinion.
8.0	It is difficult for them to have independent thinking after lisr=tening t
1.0	Admittedly, sharing teachers mind to students could enable students to overlook things in many views.
1.0	However, in many students' mind teacher is a authority, and even though they have contradicted opinion, they are willing to accept their teachers' idea.
3.0	Parents often use some ways to encourge children to study.
3.0	Some of them chose using money to stimulate their children like higher grade, higher money.
11.0	I disagree with this opinion.
5.0	Frist of all, children is in the time of forming their impression towards this world.
8.0	If parents use this way to encourge, he will assioclate money with his own study.
8.0	However study is his own thing, parents shouldn't pay for it.
8.0	Once you don't pay for his high grade, he will think his assignment is over.
8.0	Study is a pure thing, he should desire knowlege instead of money.
8.0	This way maybe led to a bad result.
5.0	Secondly, school-age children should't have too much money.
8.0	In this age, the essensical thing is study.
8.0	If their want some thing, He could communicate with you in his dailly life.
8.0	You aslo get an oppotunity to know his ideas.
8.0	Communication is very important, it's neccssary for children' healthy growth.
8.0	However, if he have enough money to buy some things he want by this way , he will think this communication is useless.
8.0	Maybe he is in a wrong way and you do not have notice in time, because good grade is not everything.
0.0	I don't think offer money to children is a good thing.
0.0	And as a prize or stimulation for children' study is also not a clever way.
0.0	Maybe to be a guide of their life is more important.
3.0	The education issue has never been more prominent in history than it is today.
3.0	As peoplevalue education more, parents may create new ways to encourage their children to be more enthusiastic about learning.
3.0	Recently , the phenomenon of parents giving their children money as a reward for high scores in school has caused wide publicconcern.
11.0	Some people think it willchange children's view of learning and make them believe that only money is the purpose of learning.
10.0	However, I think giving kids some money as a reward is a good option, a trade-off option.
5.0	At first, It is unwise to give a lot of money at a time when children are getting good grades because they will only seek money in their studies.
9.0	Our desired goal is to encourage our children and tell them to pirsue more success.
9.0	However, if we make sure children don't misunderstand the meaning of rewards, maintain a healthy attitude toward money.
5.0	Financial thinking as an important ability is useful to modern people, which means we need to teach our children how to manage their money.
9.0	In a way that rewards money, children will have the opportunity to manage their money.
9.0	Parents are not only good for their children's present life, but also for their future.
2.0	From what I have mentioned adove, I should strengthen my opinion that is good for parents to give their children money as a erward for getting high scores in shcool.
3.0	Nowadays, styles of  commercial advertisings become various, it migtht towords to different customers, such as students, whit collar worker, fitness enthusiasts.
3.0	But, some Tv advertisings dirceted toward to young children, this has caused controversy in the society,whether it should be allowed or not.
11.0	In my opinions, it should be allowed.
12.0	The advertisng can gives parents a guidline, it can let citizens noticed that importance of young childrem, and if there is no adverting towards to young children, the producets for young children might be made less.
4.0	To begin with, advertisngs toward to young children should be allowed, it can give parents a good guidline, to show parents which product is good option for their young chirdren.
8.0	For instance, when I just borned, my parents was new and unfamiliar with their duty.
8.0	But,one day, when, they saw television, the TV was playing a advertising for milk powder and baby diapers.
8.0	My parents were extremely confused about which signs of products should buy for me, which one is better, after they saw the advertising, they became firm about which products is good.
4.0	Futhermore, advertising can let citizens knows about importance about young children, the advertising is public service advertising.
9.0	Before the advertising showed, people might not concern on childs' saftya lot, they just cares about themsleves.
9.0	But, after the advertising showed, every citizens have duty to keep childs safe, no matter whcih situation is , childs are the most important, Let less baby trade happens in this world.
4.0	In the end, advertising can let more sicentist to invent more products about childs.
9.0	When the merchants find their are huge benifit they can get from selling the childs' products through the advertising.
9.0	Before, they might just invent some products for adult, but after the advertising they become to invent more product about chlids, because they know this is what people like and need, then, young children can get advantages from the advertising.
10.0	In cloclusion, the adverstising
3.0	Many parents now give their kids money or things they desire in order to encourage their children to learn and get a better grade.
11.0	However, I partly agree that it is a good way to benefit students in their study.
4.0	Offering a visable prize can motivate students as students will focus on study and once they get a good mark, they can get the moey and buy whatever they want.
9.0	Reward and efforts are seperated and because of that, students may come to understand a fact that once they work hard, they will be rewarded.
9.0	This result may push them to have more desires to learn and may gradually become interested in studying, which is the outcome the parents would like to see.
4.0	However, only focusing on good grades are not practical as the grade can be influenced by the level of the exam.
8.0	If a test is too simple, getting a good grade actually means nothing.
8.0	Thus, the grade student get does not equally fullfill the parents purpose.
8.0	Even though the grades are a good way to test a student's ability of study in a period of time, the ranking of the students at his or her class seems to be more important.
4.0	Also, to use money in exchange of student's hard work and good grades is materialisic.
8.0	I have witnessed a friend of mine, lie to her parents about the exam's result so that she will not be punished as she did not meet her parents' requirement.
8.0	It could be predicted easily from this example that, children may lie to their parents about their grade only to saitisfy their parents and get the money.
8.0	They will even make fake grade report, which is indeed terrible.
1.0	In a nutshell, I agree that, under the circumstance of the student being honest, there may be a win-win if the parents are more practical and focus on their kid's hard work and care a little less about the grades.
1.0	However, I cannot deny that money reward on every good grade may seems foolish sometimes and may have an opposite effect on students.
11.0	With the technology get more and more advanced, there will appear lots of solutions to deal with the problems of pollution.
12.0	As we can see, the eviroment problem gredual become one of the countroversal topic in recent years.
12.0	And it turns out that people have to pay much attention on it if we want to protect our home, earth.
11.0	In my opinion, i agree with the statement strongly and here are several reasons to support it.
4.0	First of all, I want to claim that cars is the major cause of  enviroment pollution.
8.0	With the number of cars increase repaidly, the situation pollution also get worse.
8.0	It is the common sense that cars will gives out carbon dioxide and other toxic chemical gas.
8.0	those gas may mixed with fresh air and through breathe to launch into our lung.
8.0	That's the reasons why in 20 years the number of lung-cancer increased beyond our imagine.
8.0	I belive that those terrible effect have already alert people to stop using car as a way of go out.
8.0	Hence, with the councious of  enviroment protection reinforce form citizen, the number of cars must decrease in recent years.
4.0	Secondly, According to a statistic we can analysis that cars is one of the most dangerous transpotation for trevallor.
8.0	We can always get the news from internet or newspaper which reported that the car accident happen and lead to numbers of people get injunry.
8.0	For my family ,we all have the viewpoint that it is not necessary to take cars when we will have a long trip.
8.0	I hope that most of people may have the same idea with me.
4.0	Some people may argue that it will get hard for us to go out without own cars.
8.0	Everything may seems that it will become less convenient.
8.0	hOWEVER, i think that may the new technique will appear to solve this puzzled problem.
8.0	For example, people could invent clean resource like solor energy or wind energy to replace the fuel so that it will no longer pollute the enviromen any more.
8.0	Also with the equipment get more and more advanced, we even could create other faster and safer transpotation like magnetic railway to help people go out.
8.0	Meanwhile, there is no pollution.
0.0	I believe that the number of cars in twenty years will be fewer than today.
0.0	It is possible for us to realize enviromental friendly .
0.0	And our planets living conditions could improve beyond our expect.
12.0	Some people may think that parents should always tell children how to deal with their own things to let them have less barriers on their road of life.
11.0	Although it is undeniable that parents want to bring their children some convinience, I still don't think that it is a education method.
11.0	In my opinion, parents should let them do what children decide to do, and let them learn from their mistake.
12.0	Here are few of my reasons.
4.0	First, the parents usually choose to tell children their own experience in order to avoid them from doing mistakes, to protect them, but this may bring negative effct at the same time.
9.0	Always being taught to do what are supposed to be right, may let children develop mental problems.
9.0	"Some may become more eager to ""make mistakes"", some others only listen to what their parents decide then lose their independet thinking skills and critical thinking skills."
4.0	Second, children do obsorb experience from their mistake and gain new skills.
8.0	I once painting in my art class when I was a little girl but felt fear about using colorful pigments.
8.0	I think any wrong brushstroke may spoied the whole picture.
8.0	"But my teacher came and said that, ""if you don't make mistakes, you will never learn anything."""
8.0	As I tried to use warm color, I found that the characters and the atmosphere the painting built should be better to use cold ones.
8.0	Though it may be a little time- consuming to color it back, it gave me a lesson that I should color the painting environment-oriented.
4.0	last, I think mistakes are more memorable than phenomenons for children.
8.0	The memories of mistakes always last longer than phenmomenons do.
8.0	"Sometimes children may forger what their parnents tell them, for example, ""don't jump on the sofa, you may get hurt!"" may be unuseful for a noughty boy, jumping up and down on the sofa can bring him fun."
8.0	But once he falls down on the floor and hurt himslef, he will probably never jump on the sofa anymore.
10.0	That's why I agre
11.0	I don't agree this statement .
11.0	I think physical exercise is the better choice to relx yourself.
4.0	First,I have to claim that the two ways of relaxing is in different kinds.
9.0	In the former way,people still need to use your brain to think about the plots the meaning of the sentences in movies or novels.
9.0	Howerer, in the latter way,people just need to move their bodies.
4.0	Neither a person is tired in mental nor in physics,he won't get real relaxation from the former way.
8.0	Because if the man need to relax his mind,of course, he shouldn't do brain work.
8.0	Even if he watch the movie or a book,he can't be devoted to them.
8.0	On the contrary, he will only be more tired.
8.0	So at this time, he need physical exercise to relax.
4.0	Doing exercise don't require the frequent active of brain.
8.0	So if you just want a relax after a hard brain work,the physical exercise is your absolute choice.
8.0	Because during the exercise,you all most just need to move your bodies,and in this time,your brain is at a relaxing situation--it dones't think too much.
8.0	I think this is a kind of transpotation of concentrate.
8.0	Therefore,after doing the exercise,you will notice your presure and burden in your mind all go away.
8.0	All you want is to take a shower and have a good sleep.
0.0	Not only can doing exercise relax your mind ,but also strengthen your body.
0.0	That's obivious.
0.0	So if a the physical exerse has these good effect
12.0	You can often see people in a hurry passing by a begger indifferently.
12.0	It is common for us to see one person siting in the bus seat pretending to fall sleep to avoid giving a seat to people who are in need.
12.0	people are nowadays under tremendous pressure from work and study so they don't have extra energy to care other people's affairs,so in my opinion people are less willing to help the struggling strangers now.
7.0	People are busy with their own issues like work and family ,they are so busy that
12.0	Recently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people: whether it is as important for older people to study or learn new things as it is for younger people.
11.0	Some claim that new things is too complicated for older people to learn.
11.0	However, as far as I am concerned, it is important for older people to learn new things.
6.0	To begin with, learing new things can make a better life for older people.
8.0	To be more specific, our life become more and more convenient because of the advanced technology.
8.0	Nowadays, most of thing can be done by phone such as paying, shopping and reading.
8.0	People just need to download applications in their phone and then they can almost do everything.
8.0	If older people can learn these new things, they will find it is easy for them to have a high qulity life.
8.0	However, if they do not learn any new things, they will have some difficulties in their daily life.
8.0	For example, my grandfather was easy to forget his wallet and sometimes when he finish his food in resturant, he can not pay the bill because he did not have any cash.
8.0	But after he learned how to use phone to pay, he did not worry about forget to pick his wallet.
2.0	To be followed, learing new things can strengthen the realtionship between older people and younger people.
8.0	To illustrate, younger people always like to learn the newest things and they always talke about the new things.
8.0	So if the older people can learn some new things, they can have some common topic with their kids.
8.0	Once they have common topic, they will have more chance to communicate with their kids which can actually improve the relationship between older people and kids.
7.0	For instance, my father always find some interesting words in yutube in order to find some common topic with me and once we find a interseting video, we can talke with each oth
3.0	Is the extended family less significant than it was in the past?
3.0	Are all the relatives unimportance for us?
12.0	From my perspective, the extended family is significant in the past and it still significant nowadays.
12.0	For the helps that our relatives give us when we meet some trouble, and perpetual kinship.
6.0	On the one hand, the extended family render our life convenient.
8.0	To be more convincible, whenever we meet some trouble, they can give us help for the bankroll or we think about the solutions together.
8.0	As a result, most of the trouble become easiest.
8.0	Consider my family for instance, with the development of the era, our consumpution level is improved, and then it comes that an increasing numbers of the seller about estate drastically enhance the price of their house.
8.0	When my parents bought the house, our extended family imburse us about 30 percents of the cost.
8.0	It is widely acknowledge that our consumption level in the past is lower than it nowadays, so the quatity of the bankroll of our relative also increase, so whenever we bought the house, the reative
3.0	Nowadays, money are not only becoming more attractive to adults, but also to the children.
12.0	Some parent will encourage their children wih money when they get good scores in school.
12.0	From my point of view, it is a controversial idea to discuss and my reasons are listed as follows.
5.0	To begin with, it is a very effective way to reward and encourage the children to put more efforts on their study.
8.0	For example, if a girl wants a doll in the shopping center for a long time, but her mother requests her to get good marks on her final exams then she could buy the doll.
8.0	The girl will surely pay more attention on her classes and try her best to do her work, because it concerns about her doll.
8.0	Parents use this method to stimulate the childrens' interests in study, but it is not a long-term thing.
5.0	When parents offer their school-age children money for the good grades, it deprives the childrens' instinct in study.
8.0	They study just for money and gifts, but not the real knowledge they gain from lectures.
8.0	When they are not aware of the importance and the real purpose of study, it is difficult to maintain their interests and hardworking.
8.0	So I suggest that this idea can be a temporary one to stimulate the childrens' interests in study.
8.0	As the children are aware of the purpose of study is to develop themselves and find the happiness in study, parents are supposed to cease this method and continue to tell them the importance of hardworking.
8.0	The work you have done is for yourself, not for the parent.
0.0	Above all, this method will surely stimulate the children, but we could not let them rely one this.
0.0	It can not be a long time thing.
0.0	When someday there is no money reward, children should still work hard because they know they are doing for themselves.
3.0	Despite the rapid development of today's society, occupation is no more than a commonplace.
3.0	Recently an interesting question has aroused heated discussion: Should people take a secure job immediately or wait for a more satisfying one?
3.0	Some people have the idea that they would wait until a excellent job is offered.
11.0	Others claim that a proper job should be taken immediately.
11.0	From my perspective, I agree with the statement that people should take a appropriate job immediately.
11.0	My reasons are as follows.
5.0	To begin with, taking a secure job right away enrichs experience in professionallism.
8.0	Due to paticipating in work earlier, people can become familiar with the interpersonal relationship, the softwares used in work and other things.
8.0	With the experience which is significent in professionallism, the people who paticipate in a job immediately are more competitive in workplace.
8.0	And the experience is the advatage in changing a more satisfying job if the people want.
8.0	For example, my sister took the opportunity of a secure job right away after graduating.
8.0	She then got a great deal of experience in working.
8.0	With the experience, she became professional in her field and have a good career.
5.0	On top of that, people can begin to earn money earlier if they take the opportunity immediately.
8.0	Waiting for a more perfect job in the gap years, people cannot earn much money themselves because they do not have a full-time job.
8.0	They need the financial support from their family.
8.0	On the contrary, the people who take a secure job right away do not need support from family.
8.0	Due to secure salaries for their labor, they can live themselves.
8.0	They are independent and do not need family's support anymore, which reduce the living pressure of the family.
8.0	Moreover, they can buy some gifts for their parents.
0.0	Admittedly, waiting for a more satislying job may lead to a better career.
0.0	During the gap years, people can study knowledge used in the job and think thoroughly about what kink of job they really want to paticipate in.
0.0	However, there are minor factors when compared with the reaasons above.
0.0	Without the experience in work and sufficient financial support, people cannot study and think efficiently and peacefully.
0.0	To put it in a nutshell, I totally agree with that one should paticipate in a secure job rather than wait for a job that is more satisfying.
3.0	Education is more and more important today, and teachers play a very important role in education.
3.0	However, should teachers show their social or politicial ideas to students is debatble.
3.0	Some people advocate it because it can make students have a wider inspective, while others argue that this might mislead the students.
12.0	However, I strongly agree with the  latter, here are the reasons.
5.0	First of all, this behavior may reduce students' studying time.
8.0	Talking these views must take some time.
8.0	There is only 40 minutes in one class so every minute should be valued.
8.0	These topic is really un related to the teaching so they should not appear in the classroom.
8.0	I have a very good example of this.
8.0	My math teacher was exactly a person like this.
8.0	He was really nagging and always talked something that had nothing to do with the class.
8.0	At first, there seemed to have no difference, but gradually, we were surpassed by the rest of the class in math.
8.0	We could be the first, but it was our math teacher that slowed down the teaching process.
8.0	In conclsion, thid kind of behavior is really bad to the students.
5.0	Secondly, when the teachers discuss those topics, it might influence the students' own perspectives in some way.
8.0	Students are still not so mature yet, they are still learning.
8.0	So what they hear today may even direct their life path.
8.0	However, what the teachers say can't be 100 percent right, so this behavior can just mislead the students which has a bad influence on students.
8.0	Thus, teachers shouldn't make their social or politicial opinions toward students in the classroom.
1.0	All in all, teachers make their social or politicial perspectives konwn to the tudents in the classroom will make the students less effective and maybe can mislead their life.
1.0	So, teachers, don't make you social or political views known to the students!
3.0	With the advancement in technology, many electronic devices and internet games changed our lives.
3.0	Near 90 percent of the children have a cellphone with them.
3.0	Some people think that because of these electronic devices and internet games, children today are harder to educate than in the past.
11.0	From my own perspective, children are not harder to educate than children in the past.
4.0	First, the advance in technology can provide children with faster information reaching tool.
8.0	This can help children to find their study resource more quickly than in the past.
8.0	Imagine this, if a child in the past need to learn some new subject, he/she had to look for some book in the library and there may be some book was not exist.
8.0	However, nowadays, there is a more varied way to get to knowledge.
8.0	For example, online courses and electronic books.
8.0	Students can easily find those things if they type them on the browser.
8.0	And in recent years, we have smartphones which we could carry to everywhere.
8.0	That's means we can acquire knowledge everywhere and every time.
4.0	another reason can be seen by everyone is that there are some internet games that border people's normal duty.
8.0	Nevertheless, that's not true, researchers found out that human's brain ability can be improved if they play online games for adequate hours.
8.0	That's means if children are not playing games for so long that their eyes maybe hurt, this activity may be a good way to relax and develop their brain.
8.0	Also, online games can improve social ability because they have to communicate with other's and even make more friend.
4.0	Admittedly, mobile phones and online games take up a lot of time in today's society.
8.0	Some children can not stop using mobile phones, and some children play online games for one night.
8.0	These things may take up their time that should be taken on the study.
8.0	However, I think parents should guide their children on how to make a daily routine more reasonable.
8.0	In this way, their children could have a good habit on their daily schedule.
8.0	Like for what time they go to study, for what time they go to play games, and for what time they go to the bed.
8.0	I think this is very essential in educating children.
1.0	All in all, I think educating children today is not difficult than educate them in the past because of the advance in technology serves a  good way to reach the study resource, and online games can relax and develop their brain.
1.0	Also, the problem of wasting time can be fixed if their parents guide them properly.
3.0	Nowadays,the competitions among students are becoming more and more competitive from Math,English to Sports.
12.0	Therefore,parents try their best to figure out a proper solution to stimulate their kids to pay more attention on study rather than spending time on playing cell phone or chating with their friends about some topics which are not related to learning.
12.0	After these parents struggled to seek a way out to give their children a promising future,money as a reward could be useful to some students during the period of studying.
4.0	It is hard to deny the temptaions of money due to every human beings,even a child.
9.0	Setting a goal for children to achieve is constructive and educational,at the same time,a reward could play a crucial role in this process.
9.0	And money,which can buy every thing in the world,is suitable to consider as an offer for school-age children when they get a high mark.
4.0	Giving kids money is not only helpful to concentrate their eyes on learning,it also provides an opportunities to cultivate a correct understanding of money.
10.0	When people are young,they are not sophisiticated with handling money,by this chance,let they deal with their own money,assisting them to have a good command of money management.
4.0	Last but not least,most kids don't aware of the difficulties of earning money,however,they earn money through their hard-working,they would understand nothing will come easily without efforts.
8.0	As young generations,once we ask for some things,parents won't reject us.
8.0	Sometimes,this behave is regarded as love,but i think it is more than love when it becomes an usual situaion.
8.0	Spoiling children will make their path more muddy,more dangerous.
2.0	To sum up,setting a target for children to chase during their learning period has plentiful advantages and it is worth to spread wildly around parents.
12.0	Nowadays, there is a heated topic arised among the public: whether it is more important to have the ability of making new friends readily than to have the ability of maintaining friendship with a small group of people.
12.0	The answer is different from people to people.
11.0	Some people think making new friends easily is more important, however, I think maintaining relationship with several friends is more important and gives me happiness.
5.0	To begin with, maintaining friendships with a small group of people can help me be far away from the bad mood.
8.0	It is acknowedged that old friends know more things about me, the characteristic and hobby and so on.
8.0	If I am unhappy, they would  accurately share the things which will let me happy or communicate with me to make me feel better, so I can forgot the unhappy things.
8.0	For example, I failed in a music competition last semester, I was disappointed at that time.
8.0	When my old friends knew these, they took the cheese cake which is my favorate food to me, and encourage me that I was the best musician in their minds.
8.0	In this case, I temporarily forget the frastration and turn to be happy.
8.0	However, the new friends would not know real me, so they do not know how to help me out when I am in trouble.
5.0	Moreover, maintaining friendships with a small group of people can cultivate my responsibility which is essential to get happiness.
8.0	To illustrate, keeping relationships will friends ask me to spend lots of time to talk and care them, so I should give up the time which can be used to do other things.
8.0	This kind of giving up have positive effect on me, since I know what is the most important things.
8.0	In this case, paying more attention on friendship helps me respect to the relationship and help me to be a genuine person.
8.0	By contrast, even I can make lots of new friends, if I do not pay attention on the friendships, I can not get the genuine relationship, so I can not be really happy.
2.0	In general, it is more important to maintain friendships rather than make many new friends.
11.0	I agree this statement.
11.0	modern life is very complex.
11.0	For young people is very important to have the ability to plan and organize.
12.0	And now is diffuclt to relaxing, people want done their work well and have time to relax.
11.0	So the ability to plan and organize is very strong tool to , make a better tomrrow.
5.0	Firstly is about study, the key thing is the time in life with study, but so many people think they does not have time to do the review, or reserch, it not time`s problem, the issue is they have not plan well and badly organize their time.
8.0	Like my roomate, after school they always want do the pc game first, not the homework essay.
8.0	But near the mid night they began busy, and often very sorrow to me said they does have time to do the review, and tomrrow they have test.
8.0	no way to flee the turth.
8.0	the tutrh is time.
8.0	So if do want to lose the game be relax and strat plan, organize you time, you need to trian yourself be a good planer.
5.0	Secondly, is about heath.
8.0	heath frist right is keep heathly.
8.0	And always have relationship with time.
8.0	You want to be heathly you need to know what is your need, your go bed time, you eating, your drinking.
8.0	You want to work fast, you need sllep, and do not stay up night.
8.0	Like me during middle school, I can not plan my life, I feel sick whole year.
8.0	Go to bed to late, eating is too much.
0.0	Another is about you time.
0.0	life is limited, no one can stop death.
0.0	your need to plan you time well .
0.0	enjoy your life.
0.0	the young people have so much time and better tomrrow, that is most importannt thing for them.
0.0	Rise you ability.
3.0	With time goes by, many young children can access to the TV more and more easily.
3.0	So there is a question that many parents worry about, if it is allowed that Television advertising directed toward young children.
11.0	As far as I am concerned, the Television advertising which toward to young childen especially aged two to five should be banned.
4.0	Here is my reasons.
4.0	First of all, young children don't have ablity to distinguish which things is right and which is wrong.
10.0	But the advertising in order to earnig more money, maybe they will play some wrong advertice to seduce children to buy it.
4.0	And many children maybe have wrong judge about the World.
10.0	second, young children can't afford those things, if they want to buy something, the only way is ask to their parents, and it will brings bad influence such as don't know the money is hard-fought.
4.0	beside, even the advertice can toward to young people, they can't make as much money as they want.
10.0	Because the children usually don't have money, and many things they like don't fit to their parents .
11.0	With the rapid development of the fast-changing society, people desire to be successful in future job in the highly intensive competition.
12.0	However, the question that what ability is more important for the success remains undone.
11.0	Some people believe that the social ability is inevitable, but in my opinion, to study hard in school is more foundamental for people to succeed in future job.
5.0	To begin with, most of  the professional skills which are necessity of the future success are practiced and accumulated in school.
8.0	This is because when people graduate from school and enter the society, faced with so much work, there is almost no time for them to acquire extra knowledge.
8.0	Therefore, what they have learned in school plays a important role in their future job.
8.0	Actually, those who have a solid command of the knowledge of their majors perform better than those who learn little in school.
8.0	So, it is essential to concentrate more on school studing.
5.0	Secondly, one is more likely to study further even after graduation since he has cultivated the habit of study.
10.0	In other words, even if people start
11.0	I think is a good idea.
11.0	There is a true story of myself.
12.0	As I was young, my mother once did this on me.
4.0	She said if I was admitted to a good high school, She would give me 1500 dollars.
4.0	It sure makes sense.
9.0	I was hard-workin not just in oder to get the money but also for my future school.
9.0	But I can't denited that it's like an orientation.
4.0	For example, it's an award like you joint the competition get a good grade so you get the bonus.
10.0	So afer I worked hard and got in to a good school, my mother gave me a large amount of money despite my father was against.
4.0	During the holidays, I used the money to travel around Taiwan and bought a new camare for myself.
8.0	The new camare shooted wonderful photos.
8.0	As the travel in Taiwan, beautiful secnerais and kind people still remain in my heart.
8.0	These memories are so treasure.
8.0	I once lost my passport in Taiwan, by the guide was so kind to take me out of the troubles.
10.0	If my mother did not give me the money, I will never experience that.
4.0	This amout of money makes you to know how to use it.
8.0	It's an oppotunity to tell you how to use a large amount of money.
8.0	If you have economic brain, you will do some investigate to make this money more.
8.0	If you enjoy life, you will traval or buy something expensive but strongly need.
4.0	School-age childeren in my country are not permitted to work.
10.0	So it seems to be a good chance to let them know try hard will get paid.
4.0	As a large thinking, the money will be the element of the ecomonic circle.
9.0	People will get work, you will get experience.
9.0	If you just keep money in your pocket, it just normal money.
2.0	By the way,it will also stimulate humanbings potential.
12.0	Nowadays, with more the spreading of phones, more and more students are owning phones, even when they are in school.
12.0	This phenomony makes parents worry about whether their children will be distracted by the phone when they are studying.
12.0	While some people are strongly against the use of phones by students when studying, I personally contend that the benifits overweigh the disadvantages.
6.0	To begin with, there are many useful apps or websites which will help students in their study.
8.0	For example, faced with unfamiliar English words in reading English magizines, the online dictionary will be a great instrument to resort to as it is not only convenient but also easy to carry.
8.0	In addition, with the development of the science and technology, lots of new apps emerges.
8.0	At present, students can learn in traditional ways or
3.0	In the present-day society, there is not uncommon to see that individuals have their own washing machine at home, which is really convenient for people to utilize.
3.0	What is more, with the straggering development of techonogy, many labor-saving machineries or even labor-replacing machineries are emergying in large number to our daily life.
11.0	Therefore, I have a profound conviction that in this day and age, everyone live in a easier and more comfortable life than the past day.
5.0	First of all, there are a huge number of cutting-edge machineris for individuals to exert, resulting that boosting the effiency to finish their assignment.
8.0	That is to say, thanks to state-of-the-atr techonogy, citizen could have an opportunity to eable their life more easier.
8.0	For instance, there is universally acknowledged that every household have to do chores.
8.0	Nowadays, with the assistance of washing machine, dish washer and micorwave oven, etc, people could finish these trivial events quickly.
8.0	However, in the past day, without these machines our grandparents were supposed to go through the first-hand experience to wash cloth, clean disher and make food heated, which was extremely tedious and time-consuming.
8.0	Therefore, life today is more comfortable than before, for the reason that the equippents are very cost-effiective for us to use.
5.0	On the top of that, most of citizen always appreciate some different tourist attractions, because of the convenient transporation.
8.0	To illustrate, with the development of transporation.
8.0	we could obtain the chance to choose a suitable method to travel around the world,so it is really easy for us to vist various places of interest.
8.0	Nevertheless, in the old days, there were only carriages for our grandparents to use, and there is no doubt that it is extremely slow, and the house have to be feeded by people.
8.0	Therefore, in the usual case, citizen were hardly to move from one plave to other place, never to say travel all over the world.
7.0	In conclusion, from my perspective, I certainly believe that life today is easier and more comfortable than  the past ys
3.0	If give student more money in school is a good question for them parents.
11.0	In my opinion they both have advence.
12.0	First,give more money than children need can develop children's self manage of money.
8.0	Follow the result,these parent can know if they can give them children more money and if they children can control themself.
8.0	And they can easily teach them children how to control them money and how to spent it.
8.0	These money also can let children know money is not easy to obtian and not all things have value to solve by money.
8.0	It can help children know how hard them parents in the work.
8.0	the money loss now can save more money loss in future,it is a good deal.
6.0	Second,if nt give your children money than need.
8.0	parents will not loss any money now.
8.0	They will not spend any money to something your parents think it not have any value.
8.0	they can make every part of money have value to pay for great where.
8.0	them children will not spend the money in game or play,the all money can help children to have class like music class               or have math class,these all can help children to be the better child than others.
0.0	Frankly say,i think give more money to children is the best choice,it is more helpful to children develop.
0.0	children can study how to manage these money and do more well in future.
0.0	The most imprtant is how to control yourself.
3.0	The issue of  students dealing with the projects assigned by teachers is highly deboutful.
3.0	Which is more effectively for students  to do projects, work together, or work alone?
3.0	Absolutly, I would suggest students to work together.
3.0	Althought working alone is more efficient to avoid been disturbed, I strongly believe  work together is more effective, because work together can increase the attention of students, besides, working together can help people open their mind and lease pressure.
4.0	Firstly, students are more likely to entertain rather than concentrate on study.
9.0	While they stay alone, they might watch TV and play games for relaxed, they are unable to menage their schedule well, their schedule would be disorder, they might study in the midnight, it is harmful for their health, might increase the the risks of illness.
9.0	However, while in a group, they will be affect by other people, and be force on study.
4.0	On top of that, working together would increase the opportunities to communicate with others, they might get inspiration an motivation from other students.
9.0	It is meaningful for them to finish their programs.
9.0	their can popen their mind in the discussion and learn a lot, while study alone, they would not be able to be provided extra ways of thinking, they would be less creative, they just think in their own way.
4.0	Furthermore, Facing with heavy pressure, their can communicate with others to ask for help, Talking is one of the best way to lease press, friend will help us to face with difficulties and solve them, we can get many helpful informations from them which we might have not thougt before.
10.0	But working alone are more likely to make us feel lonely, it will result nevigate emotion which will cause a less effective learning condition.
1.0	In turn, It is more effectively for students to study in a group.
1.0	For the reason that they can concentrate on study, open their mind and lease heavy pressure.
3.0	With the remarkable process of people's living standard, more and more parents pay more attention to the children's education, and they try their best to motivate their kids to get a high grade, For example, some parents will give some money as a reward to their children for their good learning performance in the shcool.
11.0	In my opinion, I think it's an unsuitable method, my reasons and examples are given below.
4.0	Firstly, this kind of motivation will cultivate a wrong awareness of their children's learning value.
8.0	To imagine that, if their children always get some money after they got high grade in the school, as days going by, their main purpose of leaning is to earn money instead of gaining some useful knowledge and skills.
8.0	Apparently, the wrong awareness is harmful for their later career in the future, they will miss many truly happiness from the wonderful knowlegde and useful skills.
8.0	One day, they eventually lose their passion for their wok and life.
4.0	Moreover, the money will bring some adverse effect to their children's study.
8.0	With the plenty of money, students are more likely to go to internet bar, vedio game hall, or dance hall.
8.0	As a result, they will spend more time on playing computer games, vedio games and dancing rather than study.
8.0	More serious, in such places, they will be affected by some bad-behavior teenagers and learn some bad manners from them, like smoking, gambling that have negative effect to their development.
4.0	Finally, although giving some money to children is able to motivate them to perform better in learning field.
9.0	However, the student's demand for money will become more hard to meet, they will ask more and more money as a reward to get high grade.
9.0	If one day, their parents fail to meet their demand, they will not get high grade no longer and be not be satisfied with their parents, some confilcts may happend between the children and their parents.
2.0	All in all,  based on what has been discussed above, I can draw a conculsion thay money is a short-period motivation for students' learning, and it may be harmful to the children's study.
3.0	Workers play an indispensable role in our daily life, so how to boost their efficiency and increase their satisfaction is a worth- thinking question.
3.0	Some people hold a point that dealing with similar tasks all day long can satisfy the workers more.
11.0	However, in my opinion, doing some different kinds of tasks is more satisfactory.
4.0	First of all, doing the various tasks during the worktime afford a really good way to reduce the tire and then enable the workers to get a strong feeling of satisfaction.
8.0	Working out the similar mission all day long can be energy-consuming because people can easily get tired and bored when doing so.
8.0	Then it decrease their contentment.
8.0	However, figuring different types of work is totally different.
8.0	Workers can change the task they do to reduce the tire doing the last mission.
4.0	For example, if I was a worker, I could count the revenue our company make this year after getting tired of making PPT, and I can imagine that I will get much more pleased
4.0	Admittedly that dealing with the sinilar job all day long can make the people more focused.
8.0	However, working different jobs all day can enable people have the sense of achievement and then get satisfied.
8.0	Realizing that one still has many tasks to do, people might feel tha there is an invisible power pushing me to treasure the time and work harder.
8.0	Then, after finishing all these tasks, people can feel they have compleled so many things and have been so effective.
8.0	Then they would get the sense of achievement and have an eager to do more things.
8.0	In this way, people absolutely gain more satisfactory.
2.0	All in all, workers are more satisfied when they deal with similar tasks all they long considering they can be less easy to get tired and the feeling of achievement they gain.
3.0	In our daily study life, more and more teachers ask students to work together for working out the assignment , This has a great effect on our studying metheds and the way of accepting knowledge.
3.0	I'd like to say, working with a group will benefit students more than working alone in the significant projects.
12.0	And, I will also list some advantages that I find in my group studying proccess.
4.0	Most important thing is that, if your work with a varity of student in different field ,your solution ways to the problem will be enlarge and mutiplied, every one has his own and unique prespection to learn a subject.
8.0	Thus he can use his skills to fix the problem that your aren't familar with.
8.0	Take one of my experence as a example, in our finacial course, the teather ask us students to do a presentation about bank inverstigation by  making up group.
8.0	however, it's a difficult problem on your own ability.
8.0	Fortunately, we are a group with student from different majors, the marketing major student can help us contract with the bank, get more resourse from finacial market, and the computer major student can put the data into the computer system and solve the answer.
8.0	At last , we finish it perfectly with our group.
4.0	What's more, being into a group can also hlep us making friends.
10.0	working out a problem on one'self can be really boring, when you fix the assignment ,you can get communication with your teammates, exchange you opinion about study and life, is can be a fast and effective way to finish your study.
4.0	Last but not the least, group a team can train us abilities, such as leadship and communicate skills, as well as sense of responsibility.
10.0	if you are a captain of a team ,you will master the skill of control the proccess before the deadline, and assigning the task to groupmates.
2.0	Based on what I state above all, I can draw the answer , only in the group to work, can we ge more train
11.0	I agree with the statement that parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.
11.0	Through making mistakes,children can get to know more about what the task they are facing actually means,i.e.,making mistakes can lead them into all kinds of situations and give them a thorough view on the task at hand.
12.0	It's like drawing a map of the whole site instead of drawing only the route the children should take,which indicates what happens when parents lead children through the task without allowing them to make mistakes.
11.0	After making a series of mistakes and getting the thorough view of the whole task,the children can easily know what they should do by themselves.
5.0	This is what I'm going to talk about next:parents that allow children to make mistakes allow them to gain independence.
9.0	Imagine a child is lead everywhere by his parents so he can go without making mistakes:he cannot see how to make choices or how to complete tasks by himself.
9.0	The children that are allowed to make mistakes,on the ohter hand,learn with every mistake they have made a bit of knowledge about how to handle everything by themselves,so they can get independent.
5.0	Additionally,children who are allowed to make mistakes can be calmer when they have to deal with emergencies.
8.0	Through making mistakes,children can get into all kinds of unpredictable situations,and sometimes these situations might cause severe consequences.
8.0	While children are forced to deal with these situations,the situations are simultaneously testing and promoting their psycological qualities.
8.0	Thus,the children who are allowed to make mistakes can handle more easily when facing emergencies as grown-ups.
2.0	To conclude,I would like to say that I agree with this statement,seeing as children who are allowed to make mistakes and learn from these mistakes can have an overall view over their tasks,they can grow more independent,and they can be calmer when they face emergencies.
10.0	In a word,the children who are allowed to make mistakes can actually grow up.
3.0	when it comes to the attitude towards struggling strangers, answer differs from person tp person.
3.0	Some people won't help them at any time but others don't mind giving them a hand.
3.0	As time goes by, the number of people holding the later view increases.
11.0	And my opinion, the statement that  people today are more willing to help the struggling strangers is quite reasonable.
5.0	First, teenagers today are educated to be kind and patient to strangers.
8.0	It means when meeting a struggling stranger, a child is likely to listen to him and try to understand his problems.
8.0	In this way, if the stranger put forward a requirment that is not that diffecult, it is propbably that the child will agree to help.
8.0	When I was fifteen years old, a disabled bagger hanging around asked me for a little money.
8.0	I was persued by her and gave her my porket money.
8.0	However, after I got home and told my mother about this, she stated that when she was a child it was impossible to give money to a bagger.
8.0	They would rather throw a coin into water than give it to a stranger as thay regarded that kind of behaviour as a waste of money.
5.0	Second, adults today are more open-minded.
8.0	To illustrate, people with social relationship are willing to give strangers opportunities like jobs and information.
8.0	Every year, a lot of graduated students of my school give us free lead in getting intership, facing interview, revising resume and finding ideal job.
8.0	Actually we have never met them, but they are wiliing to help us if we contact them in Wechat or email.
0.0	Admittedly, some people stiil think it's a shame if they let anybody get good from them.
0.0	Nonetheless, this kind of people are known to be selfesh and don't have many friends.
0.0	As it stands,  helping struggling people is more and more common and those who has been helped would be wiiling to help others too.
3.0	with the process of the times, transportation has become more and more convenient and developed.
11.0	i agree the tittle.
9.0	Now the cars are less than before ,because the subway and the light rail rre getting mature now.
9.0	And now the envirnment is getting worse,so the government advocate low carbon travel to protect the envirnment .
5.0	in the future ,protect willcontinue to be a difficut problem in the world .
9.0	so now many people buy the car which name is tesla or small displacement car like smart .
9.0	that car is like ordinary cars, and it is better than ordinary cars and energy saving and environmental protection .
5.0	before i always take the taxi to the school because is fast ,but now i go to school by subways because is convinence than taxi and can avoid the traffic jam , it is good.
2.0	when i twenty years , i think the means of transportation will be faster more convenient and energy saving ,so after two years ,ther e will be fewer cars in use than ther today .
3.0	Recently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate: whether the best thing to reduce air pollution is for the government to raise the cost of fuel.
3.0	Opinion varies from person to another.
3.0	Some claim that it is the truth that raising the cost of fuel is the most effective way to reduce the air pollution.
3.0	However, contrary to their view comes my perspective that there are other effectve method for government to reduce the air pollution.
12.0	My points are elaborated as follow.
5.0	Firstly, reducing the use of the private car is an effecitve method to reduce the air pollution.
8.0	As we all know, the gas which was released by a large number of cars is the main resource of the air pollution.
8.0	Therefore, if the government limits the use of the private cars, people who live in the urban cities could choose other public transpotation to the company.
8.0	And then, becasue the public transportation are able to pick more people, such as the bus, the number of the cars could decrease apparently, leading to the low releasing of the air pollution.
8.0	By contrast, if there are more cars in the roads, the air condition could go worse.
8.0	For example, in my hometown, the government limits the private cars by taking the method: one car could be allowed to run in the same road fifteen times a month.
8.0	Thank to this strategy, the air pollution declines, leading to a beautiful scene, the sky become more clear than before and the air is more fresh than before.
5.0	In addition, inventing the new efficient technology of using the fuel is an effecitve way to reduce the air pollution.
8.0	With the development of the technology,  the fuel could be used in a higher efficiency, so the air pollution could be reduced because the fuel could release less pollution than before, although it is still used in various areas.
8.0	By contrast, if using of fuel could still produce plenty of air pollution, the environment could be polluted heavily although the price of the fuel increases.
8.0	For example, in the past, burning a ton of coals could produce ten thousand stere volume of polluted air, while with the advanced technology invented, buring a ton of coals releases only one thousand stere volume of polluted air, which makes a large contribution of reducing the air pollution.
2.0	In conclusion, I must repeat my point that raising the cost of fuel can't be regard as the best way to reduce air pollution, because reducing the use of the private car and inventing the new efficient technology play the vital role in reducing the air pollution.
12.0	Having a glimpse into soceity, different people may have different working habits.
11.0	However, whatever your vocation is, there is no better way to achieve goals on work than working slowly in order to make sure that everything is correct.
4.0	In the first place, for certain work, the accuracy take the first priority for workers since just a small mistake in work will cause sumless cost.
8.0	My brother,James, is a astronomy engineer.
8.0	It is a generally accepted fact that accuracy is the most important ingredient in astronomy field because only a centimeter mistake in engine will cause a devestated impact for skyrocket.
8.0	In this way, all the machines in astronomy need engineers to check lots of times.
8.0	Even these sophisticated processes take lots of time to finished, it can assure the accuracy in each part of rocket.
8.0	Therefore, to work slowly and accuratelly can make sure astronomers' life and reduce the cost.
8.0	So, it is necessary to work slowly in order to make sure the accuracy in work, which can reduce the sumless cost caused by mistakes.
4.0	In the second place, work slowly to avoid making mistakes can greadually enhance our ability.
8.0	My onw experience can illustrate this point.
8.0	When I study foreign language, I always finished lots of tasks including writing, reading and listening in a short time in order to make sure the quatitive.
8.0	However, study quickly for me was not effective because I actually did not absorb the knowledge at all.
8.0	After that, I slow my path and spent lots of time to remember unfarmiliar works and reviewed my notes lots of time.
8.0	Greadually, I removed the barriel in understanding means in reading because of the long-term accumulation on words and grammers.
8.0	Therefore, work slowly and patiently never fail to enable people to improve their ability.
4.0	Finally, work slowly could inspire people.
8.0	My sister is a painter and she always spend her whole day just to draw one painting.
8.0	Firstly I am so confused because I think she is uneffective.
8.0	However, she tells me that painting slowly can provide her more time to thinking the fram and color in the work.
8.0	All of these are crucial part in painting.
8.0	However, if people paint quickly without thinking, it is not usefull for painting thousants of painting in this way.
3.0	Recently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people: whether people should chase the ambitious dreams or focus on achieving realistic goals?
3.0	Some claims that people should chase the ambitious dreams because it can inspire people to work hard.
11.0	However, contrary to their view comes to my perspective that people should focus on realistic goals since it is the foundation of sucess.
6.0	To begin with, focusing on realistic goals can give people constant motivation.
8.0	To be more specific, people can always reach the realistic goals if they are focusing on it.
8.0	Once they reached the goal, they will have a  sense of accomplishment which will continously inspire them to set and reach the next goals.
8.0	In this way, people will always be energetic and hardworking.
8.0	On the contrary, if people chase the ambitious, they will meet several frustration before they touch their dreams.
8.0	Sometimes this frustration will make them give up and achieve nothing because they do not have any sense of accomplishment as motivation.
8.0	For example, when I was a high school students, I always set the goals which I can easily reach if I focus on it such as improve mathematics by two points.
8.0	In this way, I constantly achieved my goals and my points were also constantly increased.
8.0	Finally, I became thefirst place in my class even I never dreamed that.
0.0	To be followed, focusing on realistic goals can help people achieve their dreams.
0.0	To illustrate, the ambitious dreams can be divided into several realistic goals and once people do that , they  will exactly know how to chase their dreams.
0.0	Foucusing on the realistic goals and achieve it step by step and people will finnally achieve their dreams.
9.0	If people just watch the whole ambitious dreams, they will never know how to achieve it.
9.0	For instance, Jianlin Wang, the richest man in my country, builded his bussiness empire with small realistiv goals one by one.
7.0	He never just follow his dreams
3.0	There will be a varity of opinions when it comes to whether parents should reward children with cash when their children get high mark in the school.
3.0	Some people hold the view that giving children money as a prize may cause children's addiction tomoney and lose motivation when doing something not for money.
11.0	However, I think it's not bad for parents to do that.
12.0	Regard giving money as a reward do no harm to children's development.
11.0	In fact,by doing so, children can acquire the ability to value and manage money and can learn that hard work deserve a reward which wil motivate them to work harder.
6.0	Initially, by giving money as a bonus for high grade, parent can tell their children only by working hard, can they earn money.
8.0	Gradually, there will be a principle that hardworking means getting more money formed in children's mind.
8.0	And that will benifit children most in their future life.
8.0	When I was a student, my mother would classify my grade.
8.0	If I am top ten in the exam,she will give me 100 yuan,but when my ranking get lower to 20 she will cut half of my money away.
8.0	If my grade even lower than the 20th students in the class I will not get my money.
8.0	There is no such thing as a free lunch and people must work hard to get their reward.
0.0	Additionally, children will learn to manage their money in the period of being a student.
0.0	As a student, the only way that I can get money is to get a reward from parent.
0.0	So if I can manage my money properly I will have no money to use soon.
7.0	After giving m
3.0	Some parents offer their school-age children money for each high mark they get at school.
3.0	In my personal point of view, this idea can be effective and is quite understandable in some certain degree.
12.0	For paying high for high marks is a way of encouragemant for children.
12.0	However, it not a policy that suits every single children.
5.0	It is universally agreed that one who works more is more likely to harvest more.
8.0	And when parents offer the children some small treats after they did a good job in their studies, the action will leave the chilren with an impression that behaving well in their studies is encouaged and it is the right direction where he should pay his efforts on.
8.0	And thus he might work even harder in an effort to recieve more money.
8.0	Their are some drawbacks however.
8.0	Firstly, some children might not be interested in getting paid for he is well aware that money he get is no more than a special prize for his good behavior.
8.0	Secondly, this kind of action might leave the children an impression that study is the only thing to do to get his parent's adorance.
8.0	And this might leads to the unhealthy growth of his mental health and his communication with others, for the strong will of getting more money might drown him in studying, which is certainly bad for a child's self-growth.
8.0	Moreover this policy may work in an opposite way for it might intrige some children's repellous emotion.
5.0	"As a conclusion, I think that it is necessary for some parents to apply this ""high treats for high grade"" policy onto their chirdren."
8.0	Because for some children, this policy may achieve a great outcome.
8.0	However, this family policy can't be efficiently applied on every single child.
8.0	Parents who are considering to apply this policy on their children should think thoughrouly.
8.0	Your children's characteristic, his age and many other factors should all be taken into accont.
8.0	Or else you might get a result that you might never thought of.
2.0	Most importantly, it's not the policy you applied on your children that have the greatest impact on their growth, it the way you treat your chilren and your attitude that matters most.
3.0	Nowadays, the question about which kind of movies or book taht a person like can reflact someone's personality has become a major matter of concern of many people.
11.0	Some peopel think it is true that a person's like can reflact personality.
12.0	The other people dis agree with that speak.
10.0	Form my perspective, i vote from the idea that we can not know someone's personality from what book he reading and what movies he watching.
4.0	In my opinion, it is can not expose someone's personality.
8.0	To give you an idea, i will explan some one like watch action movies, but he do not know anything about Kongfu.
8.0	Such as my father really like watch fiction movies, but actually he do not like any sport.
8.0	He like the kinds of movies just because this movies are breathtaking.
4.0	Simlary, some one like entertainment programme, but at he really life and work hr might be very preciseness.
8.0	For example, one of my english teacher, he is a vary precisemess at the education, but one day at afternoon one of my classmate fond our teacher at the game center.
8.0	It is really surprise us, all of my classmate have doubt that why he is play games too, the teacher like he usually do not like play games and hate games.
8.0	It is really surprise us.
4.0	In addition, one's favorite books and movies acnnot be the omnbearing indicator of a person.
8.0	Some information, suchas family background and real personalit, connot gatherfrom the book sand movies he fancies.
8.0	An individual can be muilidmensional, which is the nature human race.
8.0	We can also learn about a person drom the friends around him, because peopel make frineds who are similar or equivalent to them.
2.0	Taking into account of all the facter iscussed above, we may reach the conclusion that judding a person bt
3.0	As the society is developing at a fast pace, people can receive information easier than before.
3.0	Thus, people now not only have the access to events not just happening around them, but also the events happening around the world.
3.0	However, whenever asked about whether it is essential to know about events happening around the world, even if it is unlikely to affect your life, people usually exhibit an air of uncertainty.
11.0	I wholeheartedly agree that it is important to know news around the world.
4.0	To begin with, knowing events happening around the world can expand our horizons.
8.0	Most people don't have the chance to travel in many countries to get to know about a country.
8.0	However, by reading news about events happening around the world, people can get to know many things happening in other countries without spending money to go there.
8.0	Moreover, the society is developing, so people should learn more by many means including knowing events happening around the world to keep up with others.
8.0	For example, when I was in junior high school, I read a news about people in France marching in the street to ask the government to arise their salary.
8.0	By reading this news, I knew that in france, people can legally march in their work time.
8.0	In this way, I learned things in another country.
8.0	So it is important to know about events happening around the world.
4.0	Then, getting to know events happening around the world can help people plan their future better.
8.0	The situation in the world can change very fast, so being a memeber of this world, poeple should know events happening aournd the world to plan for their future.
8.0	Nowadays, people can go abroad  more easily.
8.0	Therefore, many students have the plan to study abroad and many people have plans to travel in another country.
8.0	However, wherever people are, safety is in the first place.
8.0	Thus, before going abroad, people should know about the events happening around the world in order to know whether it is appropriate to go abroad, even if the news won't affect their life now.
4.0	Last but not the least, knowing about events happening around the world can enrich people's lives.
8.0	When people have free time, they usually chat with their friends, it could be boring if they chat only about their daily life.
8.0	Thus, knowing some events happening around the world can give people a chance to start a interesting conversation with people around them, in this way, their daily life could be more interesting.
8.0	So it is important to know events happening around the world.
2.0	To conclude, It is important to know things aroud thew
12.0	Nowadays, as the society steps forward, there is a controversial debate that whether job generates a more significant impact on your sense of happiness than that social life does.
11.0	Many people holds that a good job does affect their life more than social life brings.
11.0	However, I want to insist that it is social life that     charges my mood more than my job for the following reasons.
5.0	Firstly, job brings about the impact that can be mitigated by your social life.
8.0	This is because, everytime when we finish our work and come back to our social life, we will lay down all the things that are related to our work.
8.0	What we always do is watching a TV program, seeing a film, reading our favorate books.
8.0	These things all can help us to release our stress.
8.0	In this case, no matter what happens in our job can be forgotten.
8.0	For example, my mother who workss a clerk in the China Bank, always needs to deal with the clients' question of finacy.
8.0	Things often happen, that people put their money in the wrong credits and they blame the mistakes to the bank clerk and think that no clerk is willing to help them, when My mother cannot make them understand it is their fault.
8.0	But when my mother comes home she forgets about all these unhappy thing.
5.0	Secondly, people always do not care about what bothers them in the job, due to the fact that they only need to consider about incidents within the limits of their duty.
8.0	This is because if one person accepts his job, he must have prepared for the all kinds of problems he may meet in his job.
8.0	They only need to solve the problem during their working time.
8.0	On the contrary, what happens in the job is not an important thing, because we know this is our duty so that it cannot dominate our mood, while social life is people's real life, so they can be affected when they face the living problems.
8.0	For example, my cousin who works as an online custom service, needs to solve kinds of conflicts between the customers and the company.
8.0	In this situation, she must deal with many types of customers, many of which are irritable or unreasonable so that they always  release their complains to my cousin.
8.0	But my cousin knows that has been her duty when she accepted this job.
8.0	So it does no significance of her happiness.
3.0	I agree .
3.0	As a student in the senior school , we do not have a lot of time to relax.
3.0	so the quality of relaxtion seems to be very important for the student.
3.0	I have thought about the question before and I think the two ways both have their own advantages.
3.0	But compare the two ways,I prefer watching a movie or reading a book.
5.0	It is acknowledged to us all that doing physical exercise will  improve our health and pull our brain from the stressed work.
9.0	However, it actually wii make us relaxed,but it does no use to improve something important in our heart.
9.0	your talking and your behaviou can not get improved by doing physical exercise.
5.0	So , from my oponion ,it is better to relax  by watching a movie or reading a book.
8.0	"Just as Edison said:""We judge a person from his or her heart not appearance."""
8.0	Through exercise,you get a admiring muscle.
8.0	But through reading,you talk to the great people , you get an exchange heart to heart.
8.0	You can admire the feeling that the roles express .
8.0	in addition,you can see the love and hate between different people.
8.0	On the other hand,if you love travelling and want to see the appealing world and there is no shortage of beautiful seneries in the world .
8.0	maybe you do not have enough money or enough time,but through reading books and movies,you can get the chance to appreciate something you never know.
7.0	all in all, I hold the view that it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise
3.0	As the society is developing at a top spped, a mounting number of parents choose to give their children extra money if they get high mark in schooul.
12.0	As far as I am concernched, I strongly disagree with the idea.
11.0	The reasons are listed as follows.
5.0	For one thing, as a student atudying at school, parents can satisfy their basic needs in most time.
8.0	For example, they don't need worry about what to eat and where to sleep at home without paying any money.
8.0	What's more, parent will pay for their accomodation and eating for their children's school life in advance in most cases.
8.0	Therefore, students in the school age don't need masses of extra money.
8.0	Owning too much money, students tend to spend money in alchohol and drugs that not only exert a negative effect on their study but also harm their health physicall.
5.0	For another, parents have the obligation to not misunderstand their children in the attitude towards the meaning of study.
8.0	For my point of of view, we students study to enlarge our knowledge instead of getting extra money if geeting high marks in school.
8.0	To persist in studying, we must be aware why we study at first.
8.0	With parents just awarding money, students will lose interests since they aim to get money rather than form a good study habit.
0.0	In conclusion, as parents, they should limit their eyesite to the high mark of children but what they have learnt at school.
0.0	School-age is a crucial period for kids to develop their attitude towards life.
0.0	Connecting the mark with money will easily leesen the kids' happiness in study, thus giving their an unhappy childhood.
0.0	If we just only aim at money, students will forget the essence of the knowledge and just persue the high mark in the exams.
3.0	Whether the rules that societies today expect young people to followand obey are too strict?
3.0	"As a saying goes ""different strokes for different folks""."
3.0	Some young people may endorse with this statement, but I stand on different view, because the rules in society can be divided into two kinds of rules: laws and not laws.
12.0	And I think  both of them are not so strict.
5.0	Firstly, most of the young people have not violated the rules about laws in societies.
8.0	Since people nowdays have a more wealthy life, and people do not have necessary to violate the rules like steal things or kill other people.
8.0	And because of the better level of education, people nowadays totally understand it is not true to do those things which violate the rules.
8.0	Moreover, because of some temptation, some young people could not control themselves to do those things, so laws can regulate them.
8.0	Therefore, it is totally necessary for government to set those rules.
5.0	In addition, it is really necessary for adolescent to obey those rules which civilian's behavior and moral, otherwise the society will not tranquil.
8.0	For example, there is a rule in society that people should offer their seat to old people or pregnant women.
8.0	Some people may argue that children are still the people need protected, it is too strict for them to obey it.
8.0	However, I believe children are springtly, and they are the fundamental part of our country.
8.0	The opinion of those people is selfish, since children need to be impart that they have the ability to help others, rather than I need other people to help me.
8.0	When they grow up, they will still remain the mindset of such selfish, so they need assistance from others instead of h
0.0	Granted, children are not so mature as adults, and sometimes it is so strict to force those children to obey the same rules as adults.
0.0	However, I think adults should inculcate such mind to children that obey this rules when kids are naive, rather than condemn the rules are too strict.
0.0	Since  establishing the rules is reconsidered by several authority and specialists, it is really reasonable for children to conduct.
3.0	Many people would say that it is not that important for everyone to know the events around the world because people are always busy with their work and studying.
11.0	I agree that it is not necessary to know all the international events.
12.0	After all, I am always struggling with my life and knowing many events seems impossible for me.
11.0	However, in my opinion, it is better for people to know the international events even though it would not effect our normal lifes.
5.0	Firstly, knowing events would help people impreove their social skills: people who knows the economic events would have more chances talking with the people that is also economy lover; people who likes politic events would have more chance communicationg with the people that is also interested in politic things; people who likes the sports events would have chances to communicate with the people who is also sports fans.
8.0	Knowing all the international events can certainly help people to find more common topics with other people.
8.0	As a result, they can become good friends and people's social comminicating skills would impreoved.
8.0	For this, my brother Lee would be the best one intending to support this idea.
8.0	Lee is a sports fan who spends all his spare time watching international spots events like the NBA competition and the World Cup.
8.0	He watches all the competitions and writes a lot of commets to state his opnion with each of the competiton.
8.0	Inthis case, he finds many people on the internet who has the same opinion as him and they communicate a lot.
8.0	After a long time communicationg with each other, they become good friends.
8.0	Lee told me that, after he has these friends, he found himself having more communicationg skills than before like how to be a good listener, he is glad that he can have them.
5.0	Secondly, it can make people's knowlege field abundent.
8.0	We have known almost all the knowledge from the textbook, our major field and life.
8.0	However, these knowledge are not enough for us.
8.0	People are always saying that it is crucial for us to keep learning until we are old enough, so that is the reason why it is important for us to know the event around the world, which is beyond our knowledge.
8.0	Image if you are a university student who is politic major, your professor asks you to write a paper for graduating.
8.0	Would you like to write all the thing based on the knowlege that you have known in university?
8.0	Of  course the events that you have know would be equally important for you to make your paper looks individual and perfect.
8.0	So that is just the reason why I persist talking about why knowing the events would abudant our knowlege, and obviously, it makes sense.
2.0	In conclusion, even if there is an argument that it is not important to know all the events, namely the fact that people are always busy, better cmmunication skills, coupled with abudent people's knowledge, makes a strong case that it is necessary to know the events around the world.
3.0	The salaries for university professors has always been a hot tpoic of dicussion amoung people.
11.0	Should we spend more money to it in order to enhace the quality of education.
11.0	I personally believe the answer is obvious, yes.
4.0	The very first thing I want to point out is that high salaries can let professors concentrate on teaching and researching.
8.0	Just imagine what will you pursue if you are in a poor condition.
8.0	Will you stick to find out the truth of a theory?
8.0	I think most people can't handle that.
8.0	In the same way, letting professors could put all his or her heart and mind on academy we must cut off their worries about life, and that's also the first step to improve the quality of eucation.
8.0	In another word, the satifying payment can make professors focus on education and realize their values utmostly.
4.0	What's more, high salaries can be a motivation for professors for development.
8.0	Of course money doesn't mean everything, but it also shows a repect for their work.
8.0	One of my dad's friend, a professor in a  famous university, make all his efforts for his work such as working several weeks without a long sleep just for fiishing a viral experiment.
8.0	How could he do it?
8.0	It depends on his salary.
8.0	Just after this experiment his school increase his salary to a much higher level which seems like a prize for him, and that motivates him to do something more.
8.0	Therefore, increasing salary means a repect and admiration toward the professors' efforts and inspires them to devote themselves to education.
4.0	Finally, many people may ask why not put those money on the improvement of facilities?
8.0	It is reasonal.
8.0	I still have to argue that, however, the professors are the core of education,  they are the spirits for a university.
8.0	It's important to upgrade the facilities, but it's more essential to inspire the persons, as the facilities are just tools for persons.
8.0	It's fine if we  don't have advanced facilities, because inspiring professors can just lead students walk into the nature and teach them by the function of this world.
8.0	But what if we only have facilities without wise professors?
8.0	The result is a disaster of education.
8.0	To develop the quality of teachers is the core to develop the quality of education.
2.0	To sum up, enhance the salaries for university professors can help a lot to improve the quality of education.
11.0	In my opinion, I think offer their school age children money for each high grade is a good idea.
12.0	Because it can provide  children more stuff to help them to study, and it can give children more chance to practice their trem.
6.0	Offer children money for each high grade can make school have more resoure to give children , if the children want to do a practice the money can help him buy some extra stuff to suppose his practice better.
10.0	Such as I'm a student in high school , my parent offer money for my high grade, one day I have a idea that to create a robbit but my school's stuff not enough at this time I can use money that my parent offer to buy exter stuff to finish my practice.
7.0	It can help study easyer , like if you have some proplem you can use this money to find a toutor  help to you
3.0	Nowadays, high is very important for very every children.
3.0	When children in the school get high socre the parents will be very happy, so they will reward for their children.
3.0	Some parent when their children get high grade thery will give children money get in school, while others believe that just buy some gift for them.
11.0	As for me l strogly agree the later one, and my reason will analysis of the following paragraphs.
6.0	First of all, l think when children get high score parent should buy some gift for them such as toy car and doll.
8.0	Which children will fell very happy and they will study more efficiently.
8.0	While we  children get money in school may other children will be jealous, so they will go back and complain about their parents.
8.0	And they will feel study is very bring and can not get any reward so they may have more negative influence.
8.0	This is why l think children get money in the school is not good idea.
2.0	Second, l think whether children grade well or not parent should reward their chilren.
9.0	Because chioldren;s self-confidence is very important, so parent should sometimes bring their chilren go to the park or go to outside eating.
9.0	There is good example for my younger brother,when he was six years old he was very outgoing person, but onece task he get only 58 score, and she month alway critics for her.
7.0	So when he 12 years old he change
3.0	In society, many parents choose to offer their school-age chirdren money for each high grade(mark) they get in school now.
11.0	As far as i am concerned, I think the behavior is a very foolish idea.
5.0	As all of us want to get a good garde, but we should get good garde in the manner of working hard.
8.0	Only in the way of working hard can we exzactly improve ourself and rich our knowlegde.
8.0	If we get good grade through the way that our parents offer money, there wiill be many potenious problem.
8.0	Firstly, though we get a good grade, as a matter of fact, our knowedge can not match our grade.
8.0	and we cann't do our jobs well.
8.0	Secondly, if we be always longing to get a good garde by others' strength, we will gradually be not willing to be courage and work hard for ourself instead.
8.0	Thirdly, if we get good grade by our parents, we will loose our confidence and we will gradually think we are not good enough to get good grades.
5.0	Once I have a good friend who got good grade through the way of her parents offer money to her school.
9.0	I was very happy for her at that time, but gradually her faced more and more problems and her become more and more dependent for her parents and was not willing to work hard for herself.
9.0	Only at  that time,  did i recongnize the problem.
2.0	SO,we shouldn't dolike that.
3.0	As far as I am concerned, parents ought to let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.
12.0	Each individual has his or her disadvantages and mistakes are unavoidable let alone children, however, in some way, mistakes can become treasures, thus how to make the best of them matters a lot.
4.0	What children can learn from their mistakes can give them a lesson to avoid falling at the same place.
9.0	Success never appears groundlessly--it always comes after failure.
9.0	The skill and capacity to draw a conclusion from mistakes is necessary then earn and improve self skills to get ready to move on.
4.0	Meanwhile, parents should not spoil their children and protect them too much to make a mistake.
10.0	Parents also ought to acknowledge that mistakes are not horrible but making the same one, which their children have had made once but do not learn from it, agin and again is the worst, thus parents can let go of their children, let them grow up themselves and just watch and help them learn and correct.
4.0	What if a kid is afraid of facing the mistake he or she made so refuse to learn from it?
9.0	These kids will probably fail again and fall at the same place.
9.0	A brillient parent can never let this take place.
4.0	As to children, they should have the ability and the capacity to face a mistake and manage to learn something.
10.0	Mistakes are not ashame, however, making the same one again and again is terrible.
0.0	When I was a little boy in my childhood, I used to play soccer with my pals a lot.
0.0	Once I kicked with all my strenth and broke my neighbor's window, which scared me to death.
0.0	I came home silently, and lied in order to cover the fact.
0.0	The truth was revealed by another kid.
0.0	My parents didn't scold me, and on the contrary, they let me face it and tell them where I did wrong.
0.0	Afterwards, I acknowledge the importance of honesty and carefulness and never lie again and play soccer
12.0	I don't  think so!
12.0	At first sports can make you healther and heather!
11.0	Survey shows the people who exercises more will make the person longlife ,and sports can make people do things more better .
5.0	Watching TV sometimes make people eyes uncomfortable and don't want to eat antting.
10.0	AIthoughread book can feed your minds but it will make teenage can't make thier eyes have a free .
5.0	Of coures !
10.0	Sometimes go to cinema can relax but you can't always watch movies I think you can watch movies for three times a month.
10.0	I think some people might say some spors player died to much early but I thinks it'sbecase ofthey dosports to much times.
2.0	I want afater ten month the mare and more people can do sports but not watching TV for free!.
3.0	It is not  a very good idea for parents to do that.
12.0	I agree that it's necessary to give children  some encouragements when they perform well,which will make their kids have more confidence and more wishes to study better,but i don't think giving money to children is a very good way.
12.0	Study can not be count by money,instead of giving money to their kids ,there  are something better.
6.0	When i was a young girl，each time when i got a 100 marks，my mother would propose me whatever I'd like to do,.
9.0	ever since  that,study became  a very happy things for me ,i would try my best to get a high marks.
9.0	For example,listen carefully to teachers in the class , do my homework immediately after school,read more books about what i've learned to get more about each point.
7.0	it's a positive method for
12.0	Parents always face a great problems when their childrena re choosing theire major or jobs, but we can see that the children tend to choose the job which is done by their parents before since parents' experience can give them a lot of help.
12.0	And it is very probabl that the children become intrested in the subject which their parents deal with.
5.0	First, it's of great possibility that the children will form the intrest in the things that their parents handled.
8.0	Take Steve Jobs for an instance, he was always curious about the electric appliances when his dad was requiring them.
8.0	And that could be the most enjoyable thing at his childhood and then he can required and made lots of machines by himself.
8.0	Then he met another companion whose father was also an engineer at high school, and he was as intrested in electric thing as Jobs was.
8.0	So they always talked about the most advanced technology and then they founded the Apple incorporation together, and this corporation created the greatset mircles in twenty-first century.
8.0	And that all started when they were kids and the bacame intrested in the things that their dads did.
5.0	Moreover, the parents can lead us to a right way and help us make less mistakes.
8.0	For example, twenty years ago, in China, parents often choosed jobs for their children and the choice frequently is the job they did.
8.0	A uncle of mine is one of these children, his parents were both accountant and he did that too when choosing a job and now he is the manager of a bank in my city.
8.0	When it comes ito talking the job, he always said that his parents did a great favor and he made less mistakes than others, so that's the most important ingredient of the reasons why he could become the manager.
0.0	Last, as subjects that we can choose become more and more, things that matter more when we choose whether a person is suitable for a job are how specilized one person is in the sphere.
0.0	And through choosing job which is done by parents, we can achieve that because by generations and generations the knowledge about this subject almost is something that we borm with, and then we can learn it better than others so we can find a job easily and earn more money.
0.0	So that may be the beat choice for the children instead of choosing the jobs that are different from the jobs our parents did.
3.0	Have you ever made some new friends in your spare time?
3.0	Of course, everyone might have.
11.0	Hence I think it is more improtant for human to possess the ability to make new friend, and then having fun with them.
11.0	Some might say making new frienfs will take a long time.
11.0	However, I think more people means more happiness.
12.0	Thus, I will write down my points below.
5.0	To begin with, more friends means we can obtain more fuun from others.
8.0	If you always talk about the same jok with your old friends, they might not think that is funny.
8.0	In the contrast, if you talk with some new frienfs, who never heard about this jok before, you will all be happy.
8.0	For xample, I used to hang out with my old friends, you know, we always had many common topics to discuss.
8.0	Finally, we talked about all things we knew, so there are no something interesting between us.
8.0	But one day, one of my frienfs brought his new friend to join us, then he talked about something strange that we never knew.
8.0	Hence, our group began to be happy again.
5.0	In addition, some say making new friend is very time cosuming, and it is not worthy to do that.
8.0	On the contrary, I asserted that if this ability can let me to communicate and be familar with each other easily, there is no such problem to exist.
8.0	Beside, always staying with your old friends is more likely to run out of your time.
8.0	You see, you can only learned the same things from your familar friends, which is hepless to you to discuss them again and again.
8.0	Compared to waste my time with some old and boring statements, I prefer to gain some new idae and opintions from other easily.
8.0	Later, I can explore the new approaches to see the same event, which is beneficial for me.
2.0	All in all, I prefer to make new friends instead of maintaining the small group of people.
11.0	In my opinion, I think it is a good idea which parents offer their school-age children money foe each high grade they get in school.
11.0	I would like to present a statement on this point of view and view.
6.0	As the saying goes, the pay is prortional to the return.
8.0	Parents of this approach can stimulate chiladrens interest in learning.
8.0	This allows children to study harder to get rewards.
8.0	This is a kind of stress.
8.0	No pressure, no power.
8.0	It is a motivation for children to reward more money.
8.0	It leads to childrens have more passion in studying.
8.0	If you are learninf with enthusiasm and motivation, you are sure to get good grades.
8.0	Such a way can make the children a little bit of progress, until the quailtative change.
8.0	I think this way, if you insist, the chikd can make great progress and development.
8.0	The reason why I agree the point is that my success is based on this experience.
8.0	In my childhood, I was not interested in studying.
8.0	But I love barbie dools so much.
8.0	So my father came up with a way that offer me money to buy barbie dools for each high grade I get in shool.
8.0	In ordwe to get my favorite barbie dools, I began to study hard and pay attention to the project.
8.0	So my grades continue to improe, and the money is increasing.
8.0	For a long time, I found that I had a lot of barbie dools, learning interest and achievements have been a remarkable development.
8.0	And I am enjyoing it.
2.0	To sum up, parents offer their schooll-age childen money foe each high grades they get in school can improve the motivation of learning.
3.0	In recent yeaes, with the improving of living standard, an increasing number of parents tend to offer their school-aged children money for each high grade they receive in school.
11.0	From where I'm stand, it's definitely a good idea.
5.0	Given money because of good grades every time, children may easily develop a concept that study is just because of money.
8.0	As is known to us all, school-aged children remain at a stage where a number of concepts come into being.
8.0	If parents offer their children money for each high grade,chidren will take it for granted that study is just for money rather than interests.
8.0	In this way, once parents stop giving money to children, it's much likely for childrent to loose their interests for study.
5.0	Given money because of good grades every time, they may naturally develop a habit of asking money for each award.
8.0	This means that once children make achievements, they will ask parents for more money.
8.0	Because in their eyes, money is the only choice for awards.
8.0	There is no doubt that this kind of reward rule will greatly bring financial preesure to their parents.
2.0	All in all, it is not a good idea for parents to offer their school-aged children money for each high grade they receive in school.
9.0	For one thing, children may easily develop a concept that study is just because of money.
9.0	For another thing,  they may naturally develop a habit of asking money for each award.
7.0	Both of the two in
12.0	Today, with the wide spread of computers around the world, the number of children who can access to computer games is increasing.
11.0	we can find that a large number of children are addicted to it, which waste time and can cause many social problems around the world.
12.0	so I agree that playing computer games is a waste of time.
5.0	We can easily find that the topic of many children is always games, especially computer games.
8.0	on one hand it reflects the popularity of computer games among children, on the other hand, it reminds us they may spend too much time on it.
8.0	we all konw that children are the future and hope of a country, and it is the time they should study hard and devote all their time and energy into study.
8.0	however the fact is that many children spend too much time in playing computer games, some even are addicted to it.
8.0	as a result many of them behave badly in the school, for example, they can't concentrate in the class because of staying up late playing computer games, they score lower and lower in the exams due to spending time on computer games instead of homework.
8.0	some even have to drop out school because of the mental disorder caused by playing computer games, thus wasting a lot of precious time.
5.0	Some may doubt that if children can play the computer games in a limited time, they may study well after a period time of relax.
9.0	but in my opinion children are too young to control themselves, it's hard for them to control the time of playing computer games.
9.0	what's more they are more likely to think about the games when they do their homework thus decline the efficiency of study.
2.0	To sum up, it's really a waste of time for children to play computer games, they are immature and they can be easily distracted by the computer games.
7.0	so we 'd rather lead them to do other activities and let them grow heathier
11.0	I am agree with that parents should let them learn from their own mistakes.
8.0	First of all,parents cant stay with their children all the time.
8.0	They must teach children how to learn from the mistake and never make it again.
8.0	In addition, let children make mistakes and let them learn from it can practice children's capacity.
8.0	If children is powerful, their future will became better, and if you only help him now, his future will became a mess.
8.0	you can't help him every time,he may thank you when you help him, but he will hate you in the future.
8.0	I have a friend who have a really great grade in high school.
8.0	But all of this is get from his parents.
8.0	His parents sent him to pew class and help him when he didn't know how to do homework.
8.0	In the third grade,his parents can't help him with his papers, so his grade dive a lot.
8.0	Now, he is in the college, all his classmates call him a bum.
5.0	Because he even can't wash his cloths or do his homework by himself.
9.0	So I think his parents should let him make some mistakes and then teach him how to learn from the mistakes.
9.0	this can excercise his ability and let him to rid him of his junk.
5.0	Here is another example,as is known to us all,poor children are ofen better at doing things than rich children because they have to do thinfs by themselves.
10.0	Their parents work in other places,can't help them,they will step to the social early.
7.0	they make miastakes, and
11.0	Should an educator earn large or not, that is a question.
12.0	being required a high leval of knowledge and profecional skill, thaking the risk and responsability exceed the common, paying for lot of hard work, the doctor, lawyers, or business leaders are both own a lot.
3.0	But teacher, the one who have same amount of knowledge, put the same energy in their cerrer, in my opinion, should naturally own the same, doesn't it?
5.0	For a start, the teacher is, was and will be one of the most important role in the society.
8.0	They work hard for the children, the hope of owr future, they let them know the world, shape their view of the world and bring the worm to the heart which is thirty for the love.
8.0	Expecially the teacher in the deep mountain.
8.0	Their endourse the poor condition, low qualtity of educational stuff and some the sense of along,.
8.0	They offten earn a little money, even is not entirly empty, but it is reaily except out imagine.
8.0	They put their hart in their childern who need someone to change their fate, not for the money, just for the love and the belief to help other.
8.0	Whethere should this kind of man or woman earn a lot of money, I think is not a question.
5.0	In addition, the high weage of the teacher can improve the respect for knowledge.
9.0	The thecher always be regard of the symple of knowledge, and if this kind of people can earn a lot, it must be let other feel important of the knowledge and realize that the society is think highly of the knowledge.
9.0	It can improve the knowledge level of the common, and improve the development of the society.
10.0	All the reason is just the tip of an
3.0	In the 21th century, family education has long been a hot-debated topic which many educational experts explore constantly.
3.0	When it comes to the question that how parents encourge their children to study hard, many people would support the point that parents can offer their school-age children for each high grade they get in school.
12.0	Simply speaking, they use money to inspire their children, which I totally disagree for the following reasons.
5.0	First of all, using money to encourage school-age children will, to a large extent, distort their opinions on value.
8.0	If parents make money a fuse for children to work hard, it's inevitable for their children to attach too much importance to money.
8.0	What's more, they tend to think that the aim of their studying hard is just to earn as much money as they can, getting astray.
8.0	For example, one of my mother's friends used to take money as awards for her son's excenllent performance in exams and the higher he scored, the more money he would received.
8.0	During the process, he forgot his initial goals, becoming a ecological scientist, and got in the swamp of chasing for fortune.
8.0	What is mor severe is that he became very indifferent to life and refused to do anything without correlation with fame and fortune.
8.0	Hence, using money as encouragement to children is doomed to result in the loss of self awareness.
5.0	Moreover, it's irrational to give chlidren money as a reward to their high score in the school, because they are so ignorant about what money really means.
8.0	In other words, they don't konw how to spend those money properly and it's beyond calculation how much money they will get squandered.
8.0	Specificlly speaking, nowadays many children use their 'earned money' to buy some eletronic or even virtual things in the Internet, during which their parents suffer most is the Internet games.
8.0	They spend money buying equipments to strengthen their idole in  the virtual world and it's just like Pandora's box, which means that as long as they sink into the trap once, it's impossible for them to stop and they will invest iun it constantly.
1.0	According to above all, not only will the award of money distort children's value point, but also they cannot take a good dominant of the money.
1.0	Supposing parents use other things, their children are bound to embrace abetter future.
11.0	I agree with the following statement.
12.0	Parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.
12.0	All people make mistakes, so do children.
12.0	They are too young to control themselves perfectly, so they may often make mistakes.
8.0	Parents should not punish their children if they made mistakes.
8.0	What parents should do is tell their children not to make the same mistake again and let them think what they can learn from it.
8.0	I am glad that my parents never blame me for what I've done wrong.
8.0	One day, I was doing my homework when my mom said she would go out to buy some food, I was happy because I could watch my favorite cartoon show on television.
8.0	As soon as she went out, I opened television immediately, I was so excited.
8.0	I could hear her footsteps when she was going upstairs, so I closed the television as possible as I can.
8.0	But I failed this time, I could not make it this time, so my mom caught me.
8.0	I was trying to explain, but my mom did not say anything, and she did not punish me, the only thing she did was letting me think independently and telling her what I have learnt.
8.0	In this case, I realize that I should not lie to my parents.
8.0	If I want to watch television, I need to tell them, not to watch it secretly and try not to let them know, that is not what a honest kid should do.
8.0	Frankly, I'd like to thank my parents for their forgiveness and this must be a very important lesson in my whole life, beacause I would not do that kind of thing again.
1.0	If parents don't allow their children to make mistakes, their children will always be afraid of making mistakes, they won't to think why they shouldn't do it, they are just scared by punishments, so they might make the same mistake in the future life again.
1.0	In my opinion, that is not good for a child's growth.
10.0	Children are
3.0	Should children get paid for their high marks?
3.0	It is a contorversary topic.
3.0	I suppose that the initial pupose of this behavior is to give extre credit to these children for their hard-working and devotion to knowledge,as encouragement.
12.0	But I do not consider this action can paly a propose role in the children's childhood as it meant to be.
5.0	The way to praise children can be roughly devided into two parts,the sprital way and the material way.
8.0	At the beginning of the school-age children's childhood,they can be satisfied by praise words of parents or tfachers.
8.0	But later they become harder and harder to please.
8.0	At this moment,money may be an alteration but it could express the wrong message to children,which is that they study hard in order to get that money.
8.0	This wrong message may lead them to laziness as long as they cannot get paid or less paid by their parents.
5.0	It is parent's duty to educate children but what is more important is to help them build the correct concept of money and their life.
8.0	Seldom pay is acceptable but it is extremely harmful once becomes a pattern.
8.0	Money is essential for everyone in this world but yet children have not relized that yet.
8.0	So it will not be wrong for parents being very careful.
8.0	I always assume that one do not study for anyone or anything else except himslfe or herself.
8.0	Yet this action may express mislead conception.
8.0	What weighs more is children is very vernourable when facing this kind of triggers,so parents should pay more attention to what they do and how they treat their children,for the reason that they are the modle of their children.
2.0	Study for pleasure but not for money.
3.0	As is known to all, we human beings always need encouragement to move on.
11.0	Not only adults, but also kids.
11.0	In spite of the good heart that those parents who offer their children money for encouragement, I do not think this is an indisputable idea.
12.0	What a students should see as motivition to study is the pleasure of doing it.
11.0	Not some other reasons like gaining money or satisfaction of vanity.
11.0	As competent parents, they should know this.
8.0	If you use this measure to encourage your kids.
8.0	It is unlikely for them to dig into the pleature of studying.
8.0	And this kind of way can't last forever.
4.0	There is High likely that your kids will form a habit to finish things just for money, if this way is insisted doing.
9.0	Which can resulting to another habit: They don't concentrate on jobs when doing it.
9.0	This habit is never something that you wish your kids have.
4.0	And as a school-age children, it is dificult for them to spend thier extra money properly.
10.0	They may use the money to buy some stuff that they can't afford before, like game machine, which is another problem that may affect thier school grades.
4.0	Comparing those kids who truly love studying, your kids may keep their good grades for one year, maybe two, but can never last forever.
10.0	Cause their mind isn't into studying, which is a kind of tasks, waiting for them to finish, money is something that can really interest them.
0.0	Judging from what has been mentioned above, I assume you are with on this opinions.
0.0	There are so many other ways that can be done to encourage a child to work hard in school, such as a family trip after the final test, maybe a new computer, even a fresh new game machine is better than some cash.
0.0	But after all, your kids are up to yourself.
3.0	From my point of view, it is a good idea to give children money when they get a good mark at school.
12.0	First of all, with the development of economy, children should have a broaden horizon of economy.
12.0	According to the BBC news, the sales money amounted to 5.6 billion dollars on the Single Day, the summit of the economy indicates that children should be awared of how to efficiently use their money when they are young, and they should get to know that money is a general way to present appreciation and encouragement, so that they can conduct a good investment when they grow up.
5.0	What's more, when children get honors, they will be happy and make the money more significant.
8.0	When children get high mark at school, parents should show their happiness and appreciation, so that children can know that getting good mark is a good thing.
8.0	With the identity of a gift and honor, money will not just money in children's eyes.
8.0	They will possibly cherish the money and save it, or use it to buy some good things, do some kind things or learn a new skill.
8.0	Thus, money is given new significance.
5.0	Last but not least, when given money, children will probably behave better next time.
8.0	With this method, parents let their children know that when they reach high grade in school, they can get honors or gift.
8.0	Hence, children will think that once they behave well, such as getting good mark, helping someone or doing the cleaning, they will get honors.
8.0	In this way, children are encouraged to do more good things.
2.0	In summary, providing kids with money when they have good grade in school is a good choice.
3.0	Which approach to success makes more sense, the capability to get along well with others or studying industrious in school?
3.0	Some may hold the point that studying is essential to access to success while others may believing in improving their interpersonal skills.
12.0	Given the choice, I prefer to cultivate my ability to get on well with people.
4.0	First of all, acquiring the skill of interpersonal communication may broad people's social network and allow them to get more help.
8.0	Since they can use the ability to attract many people and build tight relationship with them.
8.0	Take myself as an example, I tried to treat everyone with good manner and be polite and friendly to everyone when I was in school.
8.0	By this way, many people believed that I am the person deserves to communicate and get along with, so that I win my classmates' trust and friendship finally.
8.0	And they are more likely to help me when I am in trouble, which contributes to my future development and success when I am dealing with my work.
4.0	Second, the capability of getting along with others may bring people more accesses and opportunities to success.
8.0	That means some people will share you the resources they acquire.
8.0	If a person build a relationship with someone else, others will have a better understanding to this guy's personality and competence.
8.0	If they firmly believe the person have excellent quality and ability, they will give the person some resource to cooperate with him and ask him to keep in advance.
4.0	There is no doubt that studying in school will lead to a beter command to the knowledge in some specific fields.
9.0	However, the knowledge learned at school may have nothing to do with future job.
9.0	By contrast, the interpersonal relationship is still applicable in future development.
1.0	Whereas win others' trust and get along well with others is time-consuming, namely the huge efficacy it has to the success.
1.0	Have the ability to relate well with people will bring
3.0	Nowadays, an increasing number of people are thinking about the difference between working by oneself and working by a team.
3.0	So here comes the question: which way will be more effective for students to finish their work?
3.0	Team work or individual work?
11.0	In my opinion, working individual is a more effective way for students.
5.0	First, whatever a individual in the team approaches the project well or bad, he or she will be rewarded and blamed as a whole team.
8.0	In that case, when someone has done nothing for his team, once his team has done a good work, he will be rewarded as well, and vice versa.
8.0	Therefore, it is unfair for certain members in the team.
8.0	Take myself for an example, as I was working together with several classmates to make a math model.
8.0	I almost had done everything for my team.
8.0	I proposed the formula we will use, gathered all the materials we need, and ultimately made it almost by myself.
8.0	When the final day came, our work are prased by our teacher, and they are also rewarded.
8.0	I have remember this thing for a long time since it is not fair to me.
8.0	So I can see the drawback in teamwork through my own experience---teamwork is unfair.
5.0	Second, the creative members in the team may be ignored because of the leader's attitude towards their ideas.
8.0	And unfortunately, it is impossible for a team not to have a leader.
8.0	My cousin has experienced it.
8.0	One day, his teacher asked them to make a poster to celebrate the coming new year in several teams.
8.0	On following days, he thought about it carefully till midnights, and he even has drawn a lot of sketches for his idea.
8.0	But after a few days, when he discussed with his team members, they did not have further discuss at all just because the disagreement of the leader, who, decided to drop my cousin's idea immediately.
8.0	However, my cousin's idea was pretty creative and attractive.
2.0	To sum up, I think teamwork is not effective for students to use when they can work alone on projects.
3.0	Nowadays, many of the parents value their childen's high grades.
3.0	So in this way, if their children win high marks , the parents will even offer them whatever they want, like money.
3.0	Ican never imagine how such an crazy method woks well and I will never agree with such a point.
11.0	I have two main reasons for why I will never agree with such a point.
5.0	First of all, althouh I have to agree tht the student should be praised by their parents for the good grades they get., they are not worth being praised by doing a good job in just a tiny final examination.
8.0	I still remember the deskmate who I have when Iam just in primary school.
8.0	he always got money from their parents and I have to admit that he did as well as iI could in the quizs and exams.
8.0	I was always thirsty for the money he got.
8.0	However, one day, my father knew about him and finally told me that he never thought that he deserved the mony he got and implied me that I could get money only when I really did something for the family and even the whole society.
8.0	I finally understood that the grades never deserved money.
5.0	The second reason for I disagree with this kind behaviors is that the students willbe more greedy instead of working harder for the schoolwork.
8.0	For this, I want to tellyou about the rest of the story of my deskmate.
8.0	day after day, he gredually under stood he could not enhence himself successfully all the time, which means he could not always get money from his parents.
8.0	In this way he became more and more greedy and finally he walked into a path of cheatind in the examination.
8.0	And sadlly he could never step into the gate of a good junior school.
8.0	expericing this sad stor I cannot accept that view any longer.
2.0	Ater saying all above, I think everyone should understand why I do not accept this behavior
3.0	Television advertising aiming at young children is not uncommon these days and have been increasing.
11.0	When it comes to the controversial debate about whether television advertising directed toward children and youth should be allowed or not, I hold the believe that it should be permitted.
5.0	For one thing, this advertising will assist children to find their interests, enriching their lives.
8.0	Young children have limited knowledge of the outside world, television is a significant access for them to catch up with it.
8.0	Television advertising may give more options for their lives.
8.0	When my niece was four years old, she asked my uncle to teach her dance.
8.0	We were all surprised, since on one in our family can dance.
8.0	Then, she switched the channels on TV very quickly and showed us the advertising about dancing.
8.0	Then, my uncle sent her to learn dancing.
8.0	Now she can dance really well.
8.0	Besides, she made many friends in her learning process of dance.
8.0	Thus, television advertising may expand the outlook  of the young and help them find out interests.
5.0	For another, this advertising may educate children to behave well.
8.0	There are now some advertising told children to be polite.
8.0	One thing about my niece also comes to mind.
8.0	One day, she actively asked to help my ant do housework.
8.0	My ant was so surprised to ask why she did this.
8.0	She said that an advertising said parents were tired, so she should help dad and mom.
8.0	They can have more time to take a rest.
8.0	My ant was so proud of her and complimented her.
8.0	Some television advertising directed toward young children may contribute to the education of making the young polite.
1.0	Admittedly, there is advertising, which is false or distorted, may mislead young children.
1.0	The negetive advertising may lead innocent children to ask their parents to spend money luvishly.
7.0	However, parents can take the chance to educate their children and teach them to tell right from w
3.0	I don't think it's a good idea that some parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade or high mark they get in the school.
11.0	The reasons are as follows.
4.0	"Initially, the behavior that parents offering money as the reward of the high grade or high mark will turn the children from ""study for themselves"" to ""study for the money""."
9.0	Once the parents reduce the amount of the money or cancel the reward, they may possibily stop their study or even argue with their parrents.
9.0	Yes as we can see, children will gradually interest in the reward--money but not the progress in their exam.
4.0	In addition, children do not know how to manage their money.
8.0	They may form the habit of abusing their money for they may get a lot of them as rewards.
8.0	Once the habit of abusing money is formed, there's no denying that it's really difficult to change it.
8.0	I have a neighbor who gives his child whatever his child want when the child is young, and now as the child has grown up, he cannot manage his money properly and often has to lend money from his friends.
8.0	Parents should wait until the children have learned some finacial knowledge then let the children to have touch with money.
8.0	Otherwise it's harmful to the kids.
4.0	Further more, it's a burden for the parrents.
8.0	As we all know that nowadays parents are having a hard time paying for the car, the house, the water, electricty, gases, and the kids' school fees or the education fees.
8.0	It's costly for them to offer their school-age kids money for each high grade or high mark they get in the school.
8.0	Maybe for some rich family it's affordable or even a piece of cake, nevertheless for most of the family, it's not acceptance.
3.0	Nowadays, most of ecological environment is destroyed, and many wild animals are hunted for greater profits.
3.0	The air we breathe and the water we drink are no longer clean, and the biological chain is destroyed.
12.0	So is necessary for governments to protect the wild animals
6.0	To begin with, destroying the ecological environment can damage the ecological environment, causing irreversible consequenses such as dust storms and acid rain.
8.0	If the area is destroyed, we will live very uncomfortable.
8.0	For example, there used to be a forest in my hometown, there were many trees there.
8.0	In summer, the elder people would enjoy the cool under the trees, and the children would play together under the trees.
8.0	And there were lots of birds in the trees, you can wake up every morning and hear the bird.
8.0	But a few years ago, a company went to this area to do development, in order to build some apartment they cut down all trees.
8.0	Because of this, my hometown no longer has very fresh air and water.
12.0	Recently, a topic that is related to communication has aroused a heated debate: it is better to communicate in person rather than through emails among colleagues or classmates when doing a project.
11.0	Some people think that emails seem to be more formal than face to face.
11.0	However, I definitely agree that communicating in person is better than through emails in order to do a project.
5.0	To begin with, face to face is the most direct approach for people to communicate with others.
8.0	It is common that people misunderstand others when communicating through messages or emails, because the texts are neither alive nor dynamic, and people usually cannot understand others thoughts by reading only the texts.
8.0	Many words have more than one meaning and the meanings are contrasting, which will cause bad effects no matter when doing a project or dealing some problems.
8.0	For example, I once sent an email to my partner about my idea on our teamwork.
8.0	She was not at school because it was a weekend.
8.0	She misunderstood me and made a thing that is not m
5.0	Moreover, communicating in person is the most effective way to finish a project.
8.0	Emails usually cannot be read in time when there is no signal or others are busy, which will decrease the efficiency of working and studying.
8.0	What is more, it needs a lot of time to tying and discribing one's opinion through emails, which is a waste of time.
8.0	On the contrary, if people communicate with others in person, they will be able to know each others meaning, and eliminate the gap between their understandings.
2.0	From what has been mentioned above, communicating in person is not only the most direct but also the most effective way for people to do a project, which may also promote their relationship.
12.0	Recently, there is a heated discussion about whether the student in morden time will spend more time an doing homework or join organized activities.
12.0	some people that the student in past time were more willing to fouce on studenting and partcipating in activities there is because the chance of studenting and activity are rare.
12.0	However ,others hold a dissmilar viewpoint that these days, student will spend more time on studenting and joining activities.
12.0	My reasons and examples are listed as follows.
6.0	One reason why i am in favor of my perspective is that the heavier pressure in morden time will lead to student have had to use more time to do homework, this is because with the development of society, the pressure o social competition is increasing, and the school must add the quabtity of homework if they want their students' performance better than other schools, which is the factor ture that student have more homework than the student in past time.
9.0	A good example of this is my mother and me.
9.0	My mother never wortied that whether she could finished her homework because her homework is eazy and few, she had many time to recreat.
7.0	But as a student, i must in fact so many homework w
3.0	With the development of the society, young people are become more and more different form the young people  in the past.
12.0	It is hot topic for people to discuss that young people are better able to make decisons about their own live these days than in the past.
11.0	In my opnion, today young people are more likely to make decisons abot their own lives.
11.0	The reasons are as follow.
4.0	The first reason i think today young people are more indepentdent is today's young people have better economic position.
8.0	In the past many people's family are too poor to let them go to school,they must stay at home and till the land to feed the whole family.
8.0	There is no chance for them to choose what kind of life they like to live.
8.0	However, most of today's young people can go to school and their family have money tosupport them to chase their dreams.
4.0	The second reaon i think today young people are better able to make their decisons about their own lives is today's trip mode are more convenient than in the past.
9.0	Today's young people have more opportunities to travel around the world but in the past,people can only  live in the small city and maybe spend their own lives there.
9.0	So today's know more choices for life and people in the past rely more on their parents to make decisons for them.
4.0	The third reason is that today's people have more openness and inclusivenesss.
9.0	In the past many people do not accept some jobs and they prefer their children to become teachers or doctors.
9.0	Nowdays, people become more open and they respect their children's dreams and encourage their children to chase their own dreams.
2.0	All in All, the changes and development of society make today's young people are better able to make decions about their own lives.
3.0	Recently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate: whether will people spend less time cooking and preparing foods in twenty years that today.
3.0	Some claim that there win not be any difference of the time spent on cooking.
11.0	However, I extrapolate that people is likely to spend more time on cooking.
12.0	My perspective is specified as follows.
5.0	First, People have less and less leisure time currently and this trend will continue existing.
8.0	With the help of highly advanced technology, we can communicate with each other faster and more distantly and the downside is that we have a faster and faster living style.
8.0	People now is inclined to spend more and more time on coping with faster and faster living tempo, meaning that they have less time avilalbe to cook.
8.0	The essential reason is the development of technology and therefore, the trend of having less cooking time could diminish, unless technology should no longer develop.
8.0	For example,  l have experience the change of living style.
8.0	Previously, my mother always had sufficient time to cook dinner for my father and me.
8.0	However, my father spend less and less time in home, not to mention that my mother also has a job, meaning that we can not cook ourselves.
5.0	Second, people now have more efficient access to food.
8.0	With the development of network, people can order food online and courier can deliver their food right to their home, eliminating that time spending on either preparing and cooking or going to the resturaut.
8.0	Therefore, people will definitely prefer this the living style and Considering the subsequently developing potiential, ordering online will becoming more and more efficient and convinient meaning less and less time spending on cooking.
8.0	What is more, there is a new technology of freezen food having been developed which only needs micowave to heat up.
8.0	This technology also increase the odds of spending less time on cooking.
3.0	Nowadays, some parents offer their children money for each hide grade mark they get in school.
3.0	Yet scores of people argues that this decrease the passion of their study, as a result of which they are opposed to this methods.
11.0	However, as far as I'm concerned, if I were those parents, I'd continue to do this.
5.0	First of all, this method could be domestic power to encourage the efforts of the teenagers.
9.0	Since they have a awareness that they are not able to receive money if they don't attach great importance to hard working, they'll became extremely concentrated in studying in order to get high marks and more money.
9.0	In this way, it is indeed an interior idea.
5.0	Secondly, it is no doubt that during the period of this the youngers achieve success.
10.0	Not only do they believe that success still need working without stop, but also they receive happiness and difficulties of their efforts, which may convince them that no difficulties could bother their roads to the gate of achivement if they study as hard as possible.
1.0	Finally, the high number of money occurs to them that the harder they work, the more they may receive, which, on the other hand, tells them that their gains are equivalent to their pays.
1.0	This will somehow, encourage them to work harder than before.
11.0	I don't think this is a good idea.
12.0	Even though this approch will make children get higher score more effectively,what it makes children lose can't bring back.
6.0	First of all,trying thier best to get good grade becomes the way children earn money,which is not the right purpose to study.
8.0	Parent have responsibility to lead school-age children to enjoy study,to realize how satisfied they will be when they work hard and get reward back,to have the spirit that keep studying even if you are old.
8.0	However,utilizing money as reward will make them think that the reson they study is getting money.
8.0	After they graduate,they might not hungry for knowlegement becouse they won't get money anymore.
1.0	Secondly,it is not suitable for measure everything on money.
1.0	It will lose their innocent,which is very glorious personality these days.
9.0	After children graduate from collage,they might be more and more realistic becourse of the pressure of making l living.
9.0	Therefore,educate them have more innocent purpose when they are at shool seems more and more necessary.
7.0	Imagine how awful it is when everyone just lives for money in the whole society,and how lovely it is when there are sill some sincere men who sill
3.0	Nowadays people are more than willing to help the people who they don't know(for example,giving food and clothes to the people who need them)than they were in past.
4.0	As society develops and civilization moves forward, one would expect to see more and more acts of kindness between strangers.
8.0	We would all like to think that people are growing more compassionate as humanity advances.
8.0	However，this is not the reality we live in.
8.0	Compared to the past , I think today‘s people are less willing to help people they don't know.
4.0	Firsty, more and more people live in big cities nowadays.
8.0	Big cities train us to stop seeing others as human beings.
8.0	We encounter hundreds of people just talking the subway in the morning to work or school.
8.0	Most of them just fade into the background.
8.0	Others may stand out as obstacles: the person who doesn't let you pass on the escalator, or the beggar who asks you for money every time you are walking home tierd fom work.
8.0	Most of the time we are desensitized to those around us.
8.0	As a result, fewer and fewer people are willing to help strangers.
4.0	Secondly, people have to work harder for less money nowadays, so they are much less willing to part with their hard-earned cash.
8.0	For one thing, there's the recently economic recession-a lot of people struggling to make ends meet are asked to help others, they may react negatively.
8.0	"In fact, I often see people lashing out at beggars on the streets."""
8.0	I earnd my money.
8.0	"Go work for yours!"""
8.0	This type of harsh mentality probably stems from the financial difficulties people have been facing lately.
0.0	People today are desensitized to others.
0.0	Due to recent economic troubles, they're also more likely to help other people.
0.0	So I agree with the statement that people today are more willing to help the struggling strangers.
3.0	With the increasing awareness of education ,parents attach more attention to their offsprings'study.
3.0	In some opinions,the proper way is to reward the mark they get in school.
11.0	However,I tend to have different understanding on the topic.
6.0	Admittedly,offering appropriate money to chidren as a metrod of rewarding the hardworking is comprehensible.
8.0	However,there are two hidden trouble behind this kind of action.
8.0	In the firse place,the higher grade does not mean the better effort.
8.0	As the result of the difference of knowledge and exams,the school-age students may be misled by rhe reward.
8.0	Therefore,they tend to pursue the success in exams rather than the study itself.
8.0	Besides,this kind of inspiration is likely to make children become utilitarianisms.
8.0	And this is what run counter to parents'expectations.
2.0	As far as I am concerned,it is not a necessary idea to give money to young children for good result in exams.
8.0	Actually,even the encouragement is not necessary to be material.
8.0	The reward must be a guidance metrod of realizing the goal of study.
8.0	In other words,the most important thing is to let the children recognize the fact that they learn for their future and interests rather than another things.
8.0	Otherwise,some chat and spiritual reward is more effective than the merial    Above all,I disagree that  offering children money for high mark is a good idea.
3.0	Workers are the supporters of our world.
3.0	There are many concerns about the welfare of workers, including questions about whether they are more satisfied when they have many types of work to do, or if they think it more comfortable for them to do similar tasks all days long.
12.0	Different people may have different ideas, but if I were to choose, I would opt to have different types of tasks to do.
4.0	There is convenience for workers who do similar tasks all day long, seeing as they can get very familiar with their work in this way.
8.0	Workers can avoid making mistakes and improve efficiency as long as they are familiar enough with their work.
8.0	One of my uncles have been working as an expense charger of a parking lot for more than 20 years now.
8.0	He does the same work every workday: charging.
8.0	All these years of experience got him so experienced that he's highly efficient working here.
8.0	However, he always complains to me how boring this job is.
8.0	Thus, we can see that simliar jobs all day long can easily get workers bored, and they are probably not satisfied with this.
4.0	Moreover, repetitive and boring work sometimes may lead to disastrous results if it is accompanied with great work pressure.
8.0	Workers may not be able to stand the circumstance.
8.0	To illustrate, there was once a serious incident happened in my country: several workers of the same factory suicided in the same day, because they couldn't bear the more than fifteen hours per day of repetitive work in the factory.
8.0	However, with different types of tasks to do, workers will be more interested and more motivated, so it will be esier for them to put up with the work pressure.
4.0	Last but not the least, workers with capabilities would definitely love to have different types of tasks to do.
8.0	As long as they are qualified enough and they manage to finish the tasks, they will have a sense of accomplishment.
8.0	My cousin, who works as a computer programmer, never complained about all kinds of demands his official gives him, because he really liked finishing these tasks.
8.0	Therefore, we can see that for those workers with enough ability, it's best to assign them with different tasks to maximize the productivity and their satisfaction.
1.0	In conclusion, I strongly believe that workers will be more satisfied when they have different types of work to do.
1.0	For the sake of happiness and productivity, it's the best to assign workers with multiple choices of tasks.
3.0	Recent years have witnessed a rise in the enthusiasm for people to learn from the celebrities.
3.0	Many books and videos are made to fulfill people's need in this aspect.
11.0	However, whether the opinions of the celebrities are more important to the young than to older people remains a question, and in my point of view, these opinions are actually more useful to the younger ones.
5.0	Firstly, young people need more opinions from the outside world.
8.0	For the adults, they have experienced enough to form their own point of views to many issues, while young people still need many guidances to ensure their success in the future.
8.0	Celebrities, though they may be some good examples, may not be able to give useful suggestions to the adults due to their different life experiences.
8.0	For example, I used to be confused when I am choosing my major.
8.0	However, after listening to a report made by one of our local celebrities about employment environment, I made my decision to major in engineering.
5.0	Secondly, celebrities', especially famous entertainers' fans are mostly young individuals.
8.0	As the modern society changes ever faster, the adults may not be able to accept the unknown celebrities who actually pay more attention to attracting the teenagers.
8.0	In this way, it will be easier for the younger people to take the celebrities' advice.
8.0	In my own family, my little sister always listens to the music made by TF Boys and she said she learned a lot from their hard-working practices.
8.0	On the contrary, my parents consider their music to be pure noise.
1.0	Some people may say sometimes these opinions from the celebrities may be useful to the adults as well, but I think the older people tend to ignore the suggestions made by someone who is at the same age with themselves, or adults may even think it is too late for them to change themselves.
1.0	In a word, due to different preference and life experience, opinions from the celebrities may be more acceptable and important for the young compared with the older ones.
3.0	Currently, lots of person believe that interpersonal connections is the most important key for finding a job.
11.0	In my opinion, it is admitted that it will provide more chances for jobs, but if you can seize the opportunities completely relys on your performance on professinal filed.
4.0	Firstly,  doing well in study is fundamental qualification to grasp good oppotunities, and you should study hard to get a good grade to display your ability.
8.0	Nowadays, many companies think highly of the interviewees' performance in school as well as their educational backgroud.
8.0	So you have to gain more excellent degree for your future career.
8.0	For example, I applied for a art editor position in our school's magazines, I did not know any teachers or students in the department, but they were willing to give me the offer because I painted well.
8.0	It is apparent that whether you can get a position depends on the capacity of you instead of your interpersonal connections.
4.0	Secondly, rich knowledge is a permanent capacity of you, and if you are outstanding enough in your academic study, it is always useful.
8.0	At first, you may be not able to find a good job.
8.0	You can start from the basic level, it may be not a suitable positon for you, but you can display your elite abilities through the working process.
8.0	Leader
4.0	Thirdly, if people too concentrate on relating to others, it may has passive influence on their study.
10.0	As a result, even you can acquir more chances through your connection with others, you cannot seize the opportunities because your bad performance on professional knowledge.
3.0	I believe everyone has the experience of doing simple homework, like copying textbooks, during the early elementary period.
3.0	Most people must feel bored of doing those rigid homework.
3.0	It comes the same for the workers.
3.0	If the workers do similar tasks all day long, they will feel the loss of fulfilling feelings in addition to creativity.
6.0	Doing similar work everyday might wear down worker's enterprise.
8.0	Let me illustrate this viewpoint with the example of Foxconn.
8.0	Foxconn is a company that runs the business of assembling spare parts of smart phones.
8.0	As a result, workers there do similar assembling work every day.
8.0	As is reported by media for many times, a relatively higher ratio of workers in Foxconn have the tendency to commit suicide.
8.0	From my perspective, this phenomenon is caused by the loss of achievement feelings.
8.0	They do the same simple work day by day like machines so they lack the feeling of achieving some goals.
8.0	And the absence of satisfation feelings makes them cast doubt on the value of themselves and in turn leads to suicide.
10.0	By contrast, lawyers tend to have a more satisfactory feeling toward life because they face various kinds of cases to defend and that offers them chances to overcome differing difficulties and obtain the sense of achievement.
1.0	As a matter of fact, human is a sort of animal that prefers fresh feelings.
1.0	If everyday is the same, which means your work is the same, the food is fixed and the people you meet never change, then why shall we live for thousands of days rather than one single day?
12.0	Most of the parents will expect thier children to have a good grade in school.
11.0	In order to achive thier requirement, parents will offer thier school-age children money for high grade.
12.0	Can money be an appendage of study?
11.0	On the point of myself, study need purity.
4.0	We always talk about the puppose of study, our teachers often tell us that you don's study for your parents, you study for yourself.
10.0	Actually, when you gain the knowlege, it is not only learned for your examination but also serve for your entire life and give you an opportunity to know the whole world.
4.0	However, when it comes to money, study become more utilitarian.
9.0	Children will not pay attention to gain the knowledge, they may concentrate on the money and take every effort  just to get good grades.
9.0	Beacause the lure of money, cheat can occure.
4.0	What's more, this method can't make children form a good habit in study.
8.0	I have a nephew in school-age, his parents offer him a big meal for each high grade.
8.0	But he never achieve his parents' goal.
8.0	The reason he fail to get good grades is that he always thinking about how happy he can be when he get good gradedes, it decentralizes his attention and he will have a bad attitude towards his examination.
1.0	Parents should encourage thier children to perform well in thier school but can't by the method of giving them money as a reward.
1.0	More time to company thier chilren or take them for a trip can be a better way.
3.0	What would you do if you are confronted with two kinds of jobs, the secure one or the more satisfying but risky one?
3.0	I think this is the kind of situation that almost everyone can be faced with, and different people have their own choices.
11.0	From my perspective, the latter one is a better choice because it can bring you joy and make you improve yourself.
5.0	First of all, a satisfying job can bring you happiness.
8.0	Job is one of the most improtant part in one's lifetime.
8.0	It comman that you spend nearly one thrid of your time on your work.
8.0	In that condition, whether the job you are working with can bring you happiness is of giant significant.
8.0	Let's suppose you don't like your job that much, you choose it owing to its security.
8.0	When you get up everyday in the moning, the awareness that you still need to do the boring thing for a whole day will definitely upset you.
8.0	What makes the matter worse is that this is what you need to face in every weekday.
8.0	However, if what you are doing are what you are interested in and you can get a sense of satisfaction from it, you will be motivated everyday and even want to go back to work in the holidays.
8.0	So a satisfying job can bring you hapiness and joy, despite the risk you need to afford.
5.0	Moreover, you can have the chance of self-improment if you take the satisfying job.
8.0	Since the more satisfying jobs are what most peer persons are interested in, this kind of jobs are always attached with the characteristics like high competition and more chances of evevation.
8.0	So choosing them can give you the chances to improve yourself.
8.0	The secure jobs, however, are usually combine with the characteristics like easy and comfortable, with little chances of elevation.
8.0	Once you have been improved and have more experience and knowledge in this field, you can find a better job and earn more money, which you can't achieve if you take the secure one.
8.0	Under this circumstances, choosing the more satisfying jobs can provide you with the chances to become better.
11.0	I think it is not good idea.
11.0	I have two reasons.
12.0	First of all,I think chirldren don't need too much money.
8.0	because when they study in the school.
8.0	they spend most of time in the study.
8.0	so they have not chance to spend money.
8.0	some high grade children maybe need some money.
8.0	but they were buzy.
8.0	so they have to study very were and study for a long time.
8.0	if some parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.
8.0	I think the children were lazy.
8.0	they spend money on the everyting.
8.0	so they have less and less time to study.
6.0	Secondly,I think some parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school is not good idea.
8.0	Because if parents do it.
8.0	the children would get some bad habits.
8.0	for example,some student like computer games.
8.0	but they don't have money to get the computer or play in the net bar.
8.0	if the parents give they money.
8.0	they can playing computer games.
8.0	finally,they mark was bad.
8.0	if children have a lot of money.
8.0	more and more student would spent time to playing others.
2.0	Finally, I think some parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school is not good idea.
3.0	As we all konw, it a good way to relax by watching a movie or reading a book because it can attract our attention and help us to feel less stressful.
12.0	Admittedly, I also watch a movie and read a book to relax, but doing physical exercise is a better way to relax.
4.0	Not only can the physical exercise help us to relax, but also can enhance our ability to adapt to pressure.
8.0	It is proved that doing sports will accelerate the matebolism in our body which make our brain get more fresh blood.
8.0	It will help us to relax physically, while watching a movie or reading a book help us to relax mentally.
8.0	We will feel down again when we stop watching a movie or reading a book.
4.0	Secondly, physical exercise are more convenient of us.
8.0	For instance, we can do exercise anywhere, in our home, in the park, in the playground, etc.
8.0	If we want to watch a movie, we need to go to the theater to buy a ticket, and wait until the movie begin.
8.0	The long waiting may make our mood become worse.
4.0	Lastly, physical exercise is less costly.
9.0	We needn't pay money for our exercise, unless we go to the gym.
9.0	Even if we do exercise in the gym, it will be cheaper than watching a movie or buying a book to read.
3.0	This is a democratic society, everybody can claim their social or political views in the public space.
3.0	Political and social perspective even occur in the class.
3.0	Should we support teachers talk their social and political views to students in the classroom?
11.0	In my opinion, teachers should not let students know their social and political views.
4.0	Firstly, it is a waste of time that teacher emphasize their political views in the classroom.
8.0	The political topic is not connected with some subject like mathematics.
8.0	For instance.
8.0	In my mathematics.
8.0	My teacher always values the political currents and social events.
8.0	Although the students in the class want to learn the knowledge about mathematics, my teacher always put his political opinion in the class.
8.0	He told us his favorite president and his favorite gorven strategys.
8.0	That makes he always cannot finish the class arrangement and waste our time.
4.0	Secondly, teachers claim their political views will limite students' thought.
8.0	Different people have different thought and we should protect others' views.
8.0	Take my teacher as an instance.
8.0	In our history class, When my teacher tought us Chinese empire Qin, he told us that he high disliked this superior due to the point that Qin is very terrible.
8.0	However, I think that Qin is very excellent and Qin's efforts accelerates the development of the empire.
8.0	I opposed my teacher in the class.
8.0	He still emphasized his opinion and told other students that he was right.
8.0	These behavior undoubetly leaves students who do not know history a single aspect about history, which will limited students' opinion.
8.0	The best behavior is that telling students the trus about history and leave them speace to thinking independently.
4.0	However, that teachers spench their social and political wiews in the class can help students know more or less about this society and politicy, which not only has positive impacts on students' all-side development but also help students set up personel social and political perspective.
2.0	To sum up, the best teacher should leave students space thinking independentl
3.0	Today,more and more parents offer their school-aged children money for each high grade they get in school.
3.0	As people in our soriety's income become higher  and higher ,parents are more likely to award their children with money.
11.0	However,  I do not consider it as a good idea.
6.0	First of all,concentrating on study is students' duty, every student has resposibility to do it well.
8.0	But if their parents give their money when their get high grade, they may think they are study for their parents.
8.0	Just like employers and employees, study becomes a task for them, not a necessary way to gain knowledge.
8.0	what is more, as parents use money to encourge their children to study, they become lazier and lazier and do not want to think about other ways to encourage their children.
8.0	Money is cold and grim, but what children's need is warmth and company.
8.0	If a child, what he or she obtains is money but lack of companying and acknowledging, that is harmful to thier adolesce .
8.0	Last but not the least, grade is a actually different content with money.
8.0	As the children is very clever or the test is very easy, anyone no matter he or she study hard or not ,he or she can get a high grade.
8.0	Giving money will be no use for encouraging them to study harder.
0.0	Althoulgh I must ackwonledge it is important to award a hard-working child, offering money is indeed a inproper way.
0.0	Not only because it has a regressive impact on children,but also it may lead parents to a wrong way.
0.0	After all, human is never as grim as money.
3.0	Have you ever seen that people told their friends the truth of a thing and their friends were badly hurted?
3.0	In this society, many people believe that we should alwasys tell the truth to everyone.
11.0	When it comes to sometimes we don't need to tell the truth to some people, I strongly agree.
11.0	There are three ways to explain my statement.
6.0	First of all, I think tell the truth to everyone is not sensible.
8.0	The reason of that is you may have a bad influence if you tell the truth.
8.0	For example, my aunt is a salesman who work for an insurance company.
8.0	She is really sincere to every customers and she always tells the truth if customers ask a question.
8.0	However, always telling the turth just an opposite effect.
8.0	Because every copanies all have some shortbacks.
8.0	My aunts may expose the shortbacks of her company to the customers.
8.0	In this way, the customers may think that the insurance of this company is not reliable.
8.0	Then, although my aunt's company really have many advantages, the company won't get many profits.
1.0	Furthermore, although telling the turth to people is an virtue called honest, sometimes the truth will too cruel to suffer.
1.0	And it will hurt another people deeply.
10.0	For instance, my grandfather was suffering a disease that won't be improve.
7.0	However, my parents tell him that his disease will be improve if he
3.0	Recently, a topic has aroused a heated debate: is success or remaining happy and optimistic when fail more important?
11.0	Some people think success is important because they can get the sense of achivement from it.
12.0	However, I insist that remaining happy and optimistic even we meet failure is of greater significance.
5.0	To begin with, keeping a positive attitude when facing failure can help people find another way to achieve success.
8.0	People who are optimistic are usually happy to try new things when they are failed in doing researches or tasks, which helps them get new dicoveries on the course of solving probelms.
8.0	The new dicoveries would probably be the key of their reaching success.
8.0	For example, I failed to apply for my dream school in USA last year because I did not have a satisfying acedemic performace.
8.0	But I tried to use my grades to apply for another famous university in Hong Kong, and I studied for a year to improve my learning skills.
8.0	Then I applied for my dream school after a year of hard-working.
8.0	Fortunately, I was admitted by
5.0	Moreover, maintaining happy and optimistic when we fail can help us learn from the unsuccessful experience and accumulate life experience.
10.0	If a person was failed in finishing his work and was fired by a company, and all he did was drinking day and night, he could not learn a little from his failure, not to mention got success.
3.0	Nowadays, people's life excepts working, studing, they would also pay more attention on other's privacy, because it can satisfy with their curiosity or relax.
12.0	I think the outcome created by this phenomeon is the famours people exprosed on public more and more frequently, thus, they have got to under too much pressure.
11.0	And, bacause people's curiosity always can be satisfied, their curiosity will be expanded and they would not pay attention on other things.
12.0	Finally, if this situation metain a long term, it will have bad influence on the career of famous people too, bacause their working center if shift from their own business on how to get more attention.
4.0	First, I think famous people are normal too, just like us, they need space to relax or protect themselves.
8.0	We can change our character to think about their situation that everyday, they face the camera, even back home, they still will be pictured privately.
8.0	I think everyone cannot endure this situation.
8.0	And, some times, a few of reporter in order to get more attention, they would not have principle to take photo.
8.0	Something that we think very funny, even use it to make laugh famous people, in their own eyes, their esteem will be hurted by the public.
8.0	The worse thing is that they may ger depression or these awful news cause them lose the courage livinig in the world.
8.0	If we do not limit this behavior, we will creat a terrible outcome.
8.0	When they get hurt or die because of the selfish desire of people, their fans and family maybe will do something that revenge the society.
8.0	According to this hypothesis, we can predit the result that pay more attention on other's privacy.
4.0	Second, people would concantrate on these kind of things, so the journalists would spend more energy on findinig the privacy of famous people, bacause people's curiosity is satisficied constantly, their desire will become more crazy.
8.0	Then, a horrible cycle is created, people would cost energy that should concentrate on working and studying to learn about news, and reporter in order to get benefits will dig more privacy.
8.0	For example, my cousin is interested in these entertaining things in a period.
8.0	In that time, he escaped the class and did not finish the homework, bacause he spend all energy on these amuseing news.
8.0	So his greades is decreased, and lose a  opportunity to get into a good university.
4.0	Finally, because of the nature of human, people like learing the privacy of others.
8.0	There is just a privating news, this person will get a lot of concentration.
8.0	Then, they will creat a idea that using the privacy to get the attention of folk and would not be to study to improve their own ability.
8.0	Then I think this awful phenomeon will affected the young people and they cannot establish the right value.
10.0	Through the analysis, we will have u
3.0	In the contemporary society, people have more demands to the quality of the professions and the work.
12.0	During the process, some argues that workers prefer to finishing different types of tasks rather than doing the simiar assignments all day long.
11.0	From my perspective, Completing a wide range of tasks is more beneficial for workers.
4.0	First of all, people are able to learn a wide range of new knowledges that can be employed in the future.
8.0	It is not difficult to imagine that if individulas received different projects from the bosses, they can satisfy their  bosses from disparate perspectives like the standard forms of the files or bosses' interests.
8.0	Moreover, workers enable to enhance the efficiency of the tasks and their own conpetencies also increased during the process.
8.0	For example, when I was a clerk in an international company.
8.0	Every day I just finished the simple tasks like creating a chart according to the datas.
8.0	Nevertheless, my boss prefered to give me a wide range of assignments to complete such as finding to higher-position bosses to submit their paper.
8.0	Gradually, I overcame the difficulties to face the bosses and enhanced my ability to compete with other employers.
4.0	Furthermore, it is essential for people to expand their social networks through this process.
8.0	It is obvious that individuals often want to make new friends in the enterprises.
8.0	If they just complete the projects by themselves, the vital goal will fail.
8.0	As a comsequence, a wide range of important tasks require workers to understand disparate workers surrounded them.
8.0	On the contrary, if people just complete the simple and similar work, they cannot connect with different individuals who may bring enormous opportunities to them.
4.0	Apparently, letting people finish the similar taksks all day long is also appropriate in the work.
8.0	They can exercise their carefulness to one simple assginment and improve it strongly in the next time.
8.0	Instead, individuals may get bored with same tasks and diminish the ability to challenge what they do not know about.
8.0	Therefore, they will lose a lot of opportunities such as being in a higher position or reassgining to another place which has more chances.
1.0	In conclusion, I demonstrate that worker should have more satisfaction with a wide range of work.
1.0	They can notice the disadvantages of themselves from different perspectives and avoid them next time.
11.0	In my personal opinion, to say whether the idea of giving a scholarship offered by the family for the school-age children is good or not depends on the specific, which in detail, the older school-age students could be more independent and discreet on using their money while the younger students are not.
4.0	To begin with, for the older school-age student as old as they're taking grade 7 or higher, giving a famliy offered scholarship is definitely okay, because they are sophisticated enough on how to use money.
9.0	Took the examplar of mine, I learned how to save money after I got educated in high school in planning 7, which should not spend these money into the meaningless video games, which approximately equals to throw these money into the garbage.
9.0	However, the main point is when children gets older, they will be more cautious in using money.
4.0	However, to those children who are not sophisticated enough, giving this type of money could made these children fall into disaster because they don't learn how to use the money appropriately.
9.0	"For instance, in the case which I saw on television, a 11-year-old child spend over 100 thousand RMB from the account of his father into a video game which called DOTA in order to buy the ""equipments"" online."
9.0	This is a disaster to the child's famliy because it's such a huge amount of money, but the key is the child doesn't learn how to use money properly and his father give away his password to his son.
4.0	"By the way, another awful thing that might happen is the children who is too young is not strong enough to protect their money, if the ""bad people"" know the child has such big money, it would be another disaster."
9.0	A typical example is sometimes the child give away the information that they have the money, when the older students heard of it they might comes to the child and force him to give some money away from the child, which does occuring comprehensively in China.
9.0	Sometimes these children are even afraid of telling the events to their parents because they were afraid of get revenge from the stronger bad students, which indicates when the children were too young to protect themselves.
7.0	In conclusion, for the children who's sophisticated enough, it is fairly good to give them money for their good behavior because this encourages them to study better, to those which are too young, it's usually not good because they don't learn how to
3.0	As far as I know,some parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.
12.0	I don't think it's a good idea to help thier children improve their grades.
6.0	Learing is based on interest not on money.
9.0	It is unreliable for children to get money by good grades.
9.0	Althogh it may imstimulat children to get higher grades,they don't really like learning,what's more,they will ignore the real meaning of learning,they even use bad methods like cheating for getting good grades.
3.0	Maybe some parents are so love their children that they don't want their children to suffer any setbacks.
11.0	And they will say that we should tell our children that what should or should not do,in order to protect our children to be injured by the setbacks.
12.0	If children were injured,they would upset and lose confidence.
12.0	Then their children would fail.
12.0	However,I think it is not love for children,although their parents think it is.
8.0	Children should suffer some setbacks,otherwise,when they face a setback,and they do not have any experience to deal with it and how to make them become clean,and they wuould be injured too.
8.0	As we all know,everything is different,parents won't face the same problem that their children face,and with time going by,their experience may be can not deal with the problem.
8.0	For example,ten years ago,if I did not have good grades, I can learn some eles to live,but nowadays,I have to go to university to live.
8.0	With time going by,knowledge become more and more important.
5.0	In my opinion,children should face and deal with many setbacks by themselves rather than find help from their parents.
10.0	The reasons is as follows
5.0	First of all,stebacks can help them have many value characteristick,such as optimistic.
8.0	What's more,dealing with setbacks by themselves can give them many experience for dealwith problem,which will help them deal with more difficult problems in the future.
8.0	Last but not least,setbacks can help children grow quickly,they will learn more from setbacks,which can help their growth.
8.0	For example,friendship problem can help them know how to get friendship and who should be close.
10.0	In a word,
11.0	With the development of the society and the community more and more parents do not have enought time to spend with their children.
12.0	For the chose between the two things I will chose the first one to play games or sports with children because to these things not only good for their healthy but also will bring many benefit to their social skills.
5.0	Firstly, playing games or sports will make the children's body become more healthy and cultivate the habbit of doing sports.
8.0	A lot of research shows that playing sports will stimulate the cycle of the blood and let the children eat much more than before.
8.0	By this way they will have enough nutrition support; so they will have very good sleeping.
8.0	In the next day, they can be concentrated on study and learn more useful information on the class.
8.0	Take my brother as an example, his parents was very busy and if they have time they, will take him to play some sports.
8.0	So my brother had the habbit to play sports and he was the tallest boy in the class.
8.0	Moreover he was the most exciting boy during the class.
8.0	Thus, I think play sports and games will bring a lot of benefits.
5.0	Secondly, playing games or sports will let the children know how to communicate with other more efficient.
8.0	A lot of games or sports need a group of people to coorperate, like basketball or football.
8.0	All of these games can not win by just one person.
8.0	By contrary, every member in this group must work hard and believe each other to achieve the goal.
8.0	So they must learn how to communicate with other very efficient; everyone must know what they should do, run or defent.
11.0	Some suggest that it is unnecessary for the old to study or learn new things like younger people do.
12.0	Personally speaking, I totally disagree with this statement and my viewpoint is based on the following reasons and examples
5.0	To begin with, if old people learn new things, their life will be much easier.
8.0	The development of advance technology significantly change people's life and make it easier than before.
8.0	However, most old people still stick to their old living habits which may cause some troble to their lives.
8.0	If the old can keep pace with the new technology, it will be much more convenient to their daily life.
8.0	Take my grandma as an example.
8.0	She is already seventy years old and never tries to learn new things.
8.0	As a result, when she wants to communicate with her old friends, she would write letters instead of using a cell phone.
8.0	That means that every time she needs to do a lot of stuffs, like writing the letter and going to the post office,  which is absolutely not a easy thing.
8.0	However, if she learns about how to use a phone, it will be much easier.
5.0	In addition, after studying the new things, the old will have more chances to enjoy their lives.
8.0	It is a common thing that nowadays plenty of old people suffer a sense of loneliness since their chilren rarely come back home.
8.0	Finding something that they really interested in can be helpful to reduce such feelings.
8.0	As a consequence, there is no doubt that it is important for the old to learn something new.
8.0	This point is beat illustrated with the example of my neighborhood.
8.0	He is not    such old man that we usually meet, who is already out of date.
8.0	I have to say that he is really a fashion person since he has a website in which he send his picture everyday and those pictures are really cool.
1.0	To put it in a nutshell, I am firmly in agreement with the claim that it is as important for older people to study or learn new things as it is for younger people.
1.0	This is because that it can help those old avoid the sense of loneliness and enjoy their lives.
3.0	Money incentive: a way-out?
5.0	Money incentive in education should never be encouraged.
10.0	In my opinion, if parents rely on this kind of way to get their kids to the study table, even though in the short run it may work; howerver, in the long run it will bring a lot of consequencies .
5.0	so far as I am co concerned, the high grade cannot represent all of the ability and poential that a student may have , it could be concluded that it can be for sure that grades determine and tells everthing about students.
8.0	The essence of the test is to measure the temporary study progress every student make in a certain period.
8.0	So firstly int his layer, it will be meaningless for parents to highlight the grades over anything else.
8.0	Secondly, I do think the money incentive is a bad idea for helping students to learn better or learn more.
8.0	The students who sometimes may cheat if they ernestly want the money from their parents, which will definately cause a ruinous cycle in the long run.
8.0	What's more, this kind of incentive will leave a bad impression on the students, they will unconsiciously think that money can buy anything, the purpose of study is to make more money!
8.0	How devastating attitude for the modern education career.
8.0	Anyway, some pros may state that, the money incentive will help the students to learn more because every student has their own dream which need to be achieved by money.
8.0	But I assume that every student dream such as buy a model car,  a pair of crystal high-heels, or a fantastic series of Harry Potter...
8.0	"These things do have some connections with money,  but parents should never educate students to form a kind of ""money-worship""attitude in a very young age."
8.0	They can change the reward method by directly give them a dreaming book or a pair of shoes instead of counting every score by money.
0.0	From these aspects, it may concluded that the parents are supposed to exert themselves to encourage their kids to study but I personally think that it never could be a good idea for them to offer school-age childern money for each high grade they get in school.
0.0	Although there may exist some reasonable points about give money reward, however, the disadvantages overweigh the advantages.
0.0	Money incentive is not a way-out, however, it will worsen the situation.
12.0	As society develops and civilizations moves foeward, one would expect to see more and more acts of kindness between strangers.
11.0	We would all like to think that people are growing more compassinonate.
11.0	However, this is not the reality we live in.
11.0	Compared to the past, I think today's people are less willing to help the struggling strangers.
4.0	Firstly, more and more people live in big cities nowadays.
8.0	Big cities train us to stop seeing others as human beings.
8.0	We encounter hundreds of people just taking the subway in the background.
8.0	Others may stand out as obstacles: the person who dones't let you pass on the escalator, or the begggar who asks you for money every time you're walking home tired from work.
8.0	Most of the time we are desensitized to those around us.
8.0	As a result, fewer and fewer people are willing to help strangers.
4.0	Secondly, people have to work harder for less money nowadays, so they're much less willing to part with their hard-earned cash.
8.0	For one thing, there's the recenty economic recession-a lot of people were recently laid off their jobs.
8.0	Those that could find often had to settle for work outside of their preferred fields.
8.0	So when people struggling to make ends meet are asked to help others, they may react negatively.
4.0	Granted, sometimes people today do demonstrate kindness towards others.
8.0	However, this is only really prevalent in smaller communities where people are more familiar with each other.
8.0	For instance, the other day, I forgot to bring my wallet while grocery shopping, and the owner of the store told me I could just pay her back later.
8.0	I am a regular customer at the store; if I were a stranger, I wouldn't have gotten the same treatment, since no store owner would trust a complete stranger to pay them back later.
0.0	People today are desensitized to others.
0.0	Due to recent economic troubles, they're also more likely to be only looking after their own interests.
0.0	Small acts of kindness may still be found here and there, but only if people are at least somewhat acquainted.
3.0	Nowadyas, people live in high-tech and high competitve life, people have a lot of intelligent equipments, such as moile phone, television and computer.
12.0	People are paying an increasing amount of attention to effects of movies and televison, people usually exhibit an air of uncertianty.
12.0	In my opinion, I think that movies and television have more positive effects than negative effects on the way young people behave.
6.0	First of all, young people watch moive and television can make them release pressure after work and school.
10.0	Their pressure comes from the competition their classmates and collegues.
7.0	When they watch movie and television
3.0	Recently, there is a heated discussion regarding whether the celebrities' opinions are important to younger people or older people.
3.0	Altitudes towards this issue vary from individuals to induviduals.
3.0	There is a common conception that the opinions of celebrities play a more important role in older people.
11.0	However, from my perspective, I strongly believe that the  celebrities' opinions are more significant to younger people.
12.0	My view will be explained by analyzing the following reasons.
4.0	One reason why I am in favor of the point is that younger people are tend to follow the famous celebrities' opinion without any identification.
8.0	This is largely due to the fact that the famous entertainers' decent looking will confuse the younger's sights.
8.0	They will take some actions to reply the celebrities' opinions, even they will asked to take drugs.
8.0	Taking my sister for an example, when she was in middle school, she liked a famous singer and became a fan to the singer.
8.0	Unfortuntly, the singer always put some pictures on Weibo and claimed many beneficials to take drugs.
8.0	As a big fan of the singer, my sister started to take drugs.
8.0	As a results, she dropped out from her school and missed the time to study.
8.0	As the example shows, younger people are more easily to accept the opinions from the celebrities without any thinking.
4.0	Another reason used to support my opinion is that younger people have more opportunities to contact with famous people.
8.0	It is because the sciences and technologies have developed rapidly.
8.0	Younger people are allowed to kown the celebrities' opinions immediately.
8.0	For example, the applications like WeChat have some abilities to create a group talking between the younger people and the famous people.
8.0	If younger people have some troubles to deal with, the famous people will give some advices to them immediately.
8.0	In addition, younger people always trust the celebrities and are more willing to listen to the opinion from the famous people.
4.0	Admittedly, the opinions of celebrities have plenty of effects to older people.
9.0	However, older people have experienced something in their daily life and have the abilities to identify which the opinions they accept, which allows they to absorb the merits from the opinions and avoid some drawbacks from the opinions.
9.0	Therefore, the celebrities' opinions are less important to older people.
0.0	To sum up.
0.0	the opinions of celebrities are more significant to youner people.
0.0	Not only will younger people accept the opinions without identification and imitate easily but also they have more medias to be touch with the celebrities' opinions.
0.0	It is well-advised that younger peope should be more carefully when facing the opinions of celebrities and choose the advantages of the opinions to learn.
3.0	I believe that everyone's school has some PEclasses or allows students to go to a trip sometimes.
3.0	As we all know, such activities can help students to obtain a great physical condition and some communication skills.
11.0	However, some say that these activities are time wasting and money consuming, because they think school just is a place for students to acquire acdemic knowledge.
12.0	For this statement, I have some points to opposeit below this paragraph.
4.0	To begin with, the creation of sports are not only a way for us to enjoy ourseves, but also an approach for us to improve our body' condition.
8.0	If a clever student can not have a healthy condition for him to stay up, he can not get a extrodinary grades,too.
8.0	To take my friends Tom as an example, he used to be so thin and too weak, so he usually can concentrate on teachers what they were talking about.
8.0	He wanted to go sleep when he want to deal with homework.
8.0	Then ,His dadtold him to go to the gym one day, and excercised with aprofessional coach.
8.0	He became more and more stronger after that, and can focus on listening to the teachers, too.
8.0	So it is very reasonable for school to provide much money on that.
4.0	In addition, a great social skill is also improtant for students as their classes.
8.0	Such skills can be used in many situations.
8.0	Such as presentation, speech and making friends.
8.0	In this regard, after I serviced for some olders, I became more outgoing than before.
8.0	Then, I always took a speech for thw whole class and gave perfect presentation to the teachers and classmates, which helped me a lot on studying.
8.0	Thus, every school should offer some finance on that.
4.0	Although some say the most important thing for school is to cultivate more high scores students as possible.
9.0	For this, I think that it is ture we will be convienent to find some high pay jons with outstanding grades.
9.0	However, the social skills are also crucial for students to learn, and the school is totally a suitable place to offer some oppotunities and much money for students to learn in this field.
2.0	All in all, I think the the sports and social activities are also important as other cla
11.0	I don't think so .
12.0	With the developm persent agreeiety , people spend more and more time on their job , which make them tired .
11.0	People need more time to relax themselves .
12.0	So it become a hot topic that which is better for people to relax btween watching a movie , reading a book and doing some physical exercise ?
5.0	As for myself ,I prefer doing some physical exercise .
8.0	I like basteball vary much , and I think I am good at this .
8.0	Last term , when I reviewed my lessons for a half day , I became awful and tierd , then I would go to the playground and relaxes my self .
8.0	It was amazing that ,though my body was overworked but I felt good , I thought I could go on reviewing for a longtime !
8.0	So I think doing some sports is really a good way to relax ourselves.
5.0	For another point of view , when we were watching a movie or reading a book , we maintain the same posture for really a long time .
8.0	It makes us stuff and may make ourselves more tired .
8.0	For myself , I don't like this mode .
8.0	Some people have spondylodynia , this mode would make their disease worse .
8.0	But maybe for some people they prefer this mode ,because they are so tierd that they don't want to move any more .
2.0	Obviously that this question is different to every person .
7.0	What I want to say is that everyone has thier
3.0	With the developement of the society and the economy people pay more attention to their choose of their job.
3.0	And I think if people have the opportunity to get a secure job, he should take it right away because the opportunity is very precious and we do not know when the job which is satisfying will occur.
12.0	Moreover I think the secure job is a very satisfying job.
10.0	So I think we should choose a secure job right away.
6.0	Firstly, the chance that people can gain a secure job is very precious and the satisfying job cannot be precided.
8.0	Take my uncle as an example, when he graduated from the colleague, his parents help him find a job which is very secure, working for the government.
8.0	This job is very stable; the propotion of lose the job was nearly zero; and the selary of the job was very stable.
8.0	Moreover this job also supported one big apartment which is free.
8.0	But my uncle thought that staty at the office was not a good choise and he did not think this job was a satisfying job.
8.0	So he gave up this job while ten years went on, he still did not find job which he think that is very satisfying.
8.0	Unforturnatly, the job he found was not as well as the job he gave up firstly and now the job which was working for the government was very precious.
8.0	So if we find a secure job, we should get it right away.
1.0	Secondly, The secure job is a very satisfying job.
1.0	When people find a job, it will be a very big advantage if the job is very secure.
8.0	My brother work at a government department and he would not care about the lose of the job and the decrease of the salery.
8.0	So he could pay more attention on his job so he improved very quickly.
8.0	But a friends of him wanted to chase the satisfting job so he worked at a company.
8.0	Every he was worried about the salery of him.
8.0	So his life was very unhappy.
7.0	Thus, the secure job is a ve
3.0	Parents all expect their chidren are mature and responsible enough to pursue a happy life.
3.0	To be mature and responsible, there are supposed to be a self-reform stage,which usually begin with mistakes.
12.0	Some parents are willing to let their children fall and let them learn from their own mistakes, while the others are trying to prevent the mistakes from happening.
11.0	As far as I am concerned, letting children err and letting children learn are definately the effective way for them to grow.
4.0	To start with, it is the approriate opportunity for chidren to reflect on their own behaviors.
8.0	Everyone makes mistakes.
8.0	Mistakes ,in most cases, can also brings value such as practice experience as long as children can have a thorough consideration about it.
8.0	No matter how much parents tell to their children, it is less efficient than learning from their own errors.
8.0	For it is the real case that happened in their real life, they can imerge themselfs into the circumstance to have a deep insight of the whole mistakes.
4.0	Moreover, it assits children to accumulate the experience for the future events.
8.0	Sophisticated adults are experts for handling tough daily issue due to their abundant working experience and life wisdom.
8.0	Children has to prepare for the challenge the society provied in their coming years.
8.0	By making mistakes and learning from it, children could figure out the rules existed in the world and the solutions to the similar situations, which is only beneficial to their future life.
4.0	However, some may question the probably severe impact of mistakes on the  children and also the necessity for parents' guidance.
8.0	In my view, children shall learn to deal with their own mistakes independently for it is a step for them to grow as well.
8.0	After all ,the life path ahead of them is their own way that cannot be changed by the force of parents.
8.0	To err anf to learn is the preparation they have to finish by themselves to face the larger burden of responsibility in the later time .
1.0	Gothe onces said that man errs so long as he strives.
1.0	Learning from their own mistakes is the first step the children shall know in their life.
11.0	Nowadays, modern society is full of new inventions and new technology, which are big challenges for human who live in modern society.
11.0	When it comes to the question whether young people have the ability to plan and organize, which is essential.
12.0	People usually exhibit an air of uncertainty.
11.0	Some people in society think that young people is not essential to have the ability to plan and organize.
12.0	However, I have a different idea.
5.0	First of all, planning helps keep one on future in achieving goals.
8.0	Young people have some grang dreams but people want to achieve the dream, they should plan ahead.
8.0	For example, I want to be a pianist when I was a 6 years old child.
8.0	I was beginning to study piano until now.
5.0	Secondly, plan and organize can promise that people have the best state to performance.
1.0	In summary,  planing help keep one on future in achieving and plan and organize can promise that people have the best state to performance.
1.0	For these reason, I agree with the statement that young people is not essential to have the ability to plan and organize.
3.0	Issues related to work style have never failed to attract people's attention.
3.0	Recentlty, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people whether it is more important to work swiftly and take a risk making mistakes than to work slowly and make sure everything is alright.
3.0	Answers vary from one to another.
11.0	Some people claim that peopple should work quickly and it is worthwhile to take risks.
11.0	However, contrary to their view comes my own perspective that people should take it slowly and ensure every part of the things functions right.
12.0	My view point is based on the following points.
5.0	First,working slowly to make sure everything is alright could actually save time and then increase their efficiency, which indeed promotes the success.
8.0	To be more specific, ensuring every part of tasks functions correctly could definitely decrease the mistakes duting the work.
8.0	Under this circumstance, avoiding making mistakes could certainly save the time spent on correcting the errors which results that people could work more efficiently than their opponents and  realize their goals earlier.
8.0	However, those who work fast cannot guarantee they could not make errors.
8.0	Despite that they seem to have faster completion than others, they may spend more time fixing the mistakes, which actually decrease their efficiency.
8.0	For example, I have formed a habit of examing every questions after I figure it out when I deal with my math exams.
8.0	It seems slow and a waste of time at first but actually it could apparently enhance the rate of rightness and decrease the time speent later Ireexamine
5.0	Second, working slowly and making sure everything is correct could also help people accumulate good reputation, which would promote their success.
8.0	Specifically,  the outcomes or products made by those who work slowly and carefully examine every stage of producing process are generally of good quality.
8.0	In this way, the products of good quality would gradually set a good industry example in the consumers' mind, which would accumulate the companies or individual's reputation.
8.0	Consequnetly, their work would be popular or thought highly by others.
8.0	For example, my uncle owns a company which sells some particular artworks.
8.0	My uncle's company produces only a few pieces of artworks every month because my uncle wants to guarantee the quality of his products.
8.0	Although it seems too slow to do this busineess, his company gradually accumulates great reputation for its beautiful look and durable quality.
2.0	In conclusion, people should work slowly and assure everything is correct, which could not only increase work efficiency  but also help people accumulate good reputation, which is conducive to their success.
12.0	Personally I agree that parents should let children make mistakes and learn from their own mistakes.
8.0	There are two specific reasons that present my opinion.
8.0	First of all, making mistakes is the way to understand your own disadvantages.
8.0	There are not any children that are perfect in the beginning.
8.0	Children are full of passion to try new things and keep reaching their own climates.
8.0	During this period, they will fall or slide down like climbing mountains.
8.0	Making mistakes let them know that they still have space to develop, and they are not good enough.
8.0	It is a good way to let them know that making mistakes is not ashmed, and they will get stronger and more resistant by sufferring these experience.
8.0	Secondly, learning from mistakes helps them getting better.
8.0	As we all know, parents will not stay with their children in their whole life.
8.0	So it seems to be more important to teach children how to solve their own problems by themselves, but not helping them to solve all the time.
8.0	When children making mistakes, it is good for parents to ask them how to prevent it next time.
8.0	For example, if children drop from bikes, parents should not be nervous but telling their children don't cry and stand up.
8.0	Learning from mistakes is a great worthy ability for living in the community independently.
8.0	If someone only makes mistake but not try to learn from it, then he is the failure.
8.0	"I have heard someone said, ""Making mistakes is not creepy, what creepy is that he just let it go but not to learn from his mistakes."""
8.0	Every great man had his or her experience learning from mistakes.
8.0	All in all, parents are the best teachers for their children to help them being a better man from learning in their mistakes.
3.0	In this social,many parents offer money to their children for supportting to get high grades.
3.0	They think this is a good way to make their children study harder to have a higher mark.
12.0	However, I don't think it's a method to encourage children.
11.0	In fact,this behavior will form a really bad habit and give children a incorrect sense of money.
6.0	With the development of economy,more parents are able to meet their children's needs by money.
8.0	So fewer children can understad the value of the money.
8.0	In this circumstance,if parents give money as a gift,when their children grow up,they will also waste money and buy more goods they don't even need because they think they worth it.
8.0	Take my cousin as a example,my uncle adore his only son very much,so he give my cousin everything he wanted.
8.0	My cousin's grades not very high,in his 40's class,his grade's always ranked 40th.
8.0	But sometimes when he got 39th in his class,his father would very happy and give him much money,so my cousin think his 39th worth this money.
8.0	Even now,he graduated from college,when he didn't have money, he will ask money from his father.
8.0	Why he take it as granted?
8.0	I think he consider he successfully graduated from college for his father,so his father owe he this money.
1.0	That's why I don't suport this behavors,studying and having high grades are duties for students,parents don't need to force children to study by giving they money.
1.0	What parents need to do is letting childrens know that studying is for themselves,not for anyone else like their parents,and they will accomplish their dreams in the future by studing hard.
3.0	When seeking for and choosing a job, the content of the is always taken into consideration, especially the diversity of the tasks.
3.0	While some people prefer to do varities of tasks to challenge themselves, others would like to do the simple task again and again to make them more familiar with that task.
3.0	As far as I am concerned, the varities of tasks wil benifit the workers in many aspects.
5.0	Firstly, different types of tasks can be more interesting and lead to the workers happy mood.
8.0	Sometimes when workers deall with the simple jobs all day long, they will definitely feel boring, but with lots of challenge to deal with, the workers can fulfill themselves and challenge themselves.
8.0	For instance, when my mom got her first job as an editor , all she had to do is to reading writers' passages and correct the mistakes, she felt upset and disappointed though her got a high salaries, she thought it was too boring.
8.0	So latter she talked to her boss and the boss agreed  to let her do several tasks together, like taking photos and make some design for the books' cover.
8.0	That was difficult for her, but she just struggled to do that.
8.0	When she finally did it well, she felt happy and being encouraged by her work.
5.0	Secondly, different types of jobs can make workers relax and encourage workers to improve their efficiency.
8.0	The monotonous work will lower the workers' efficiency because when people are doing the same jobs again and again, they will be exhausted, and there is more chances for them to make some mistakes.
8.0	Different tasks can refresh workers mind.
8.0	For me, when I studied English last summer to get a job of teaching children English, at first  I spent all day in reading part, then I felt very tired, I thought my brain was all a mess at last, and I couldn't think at all.
8.0	So I changed my methods to spend equal time in reading, listening and speaking, my effeciency was improved that way.
8.0	And take this in to workes, I think it works the same way.
2.0	So, reflecting on those reasons, a good way to improve the efficiency of workers as well as make them happy while working is to let them do different kinds of tasks, that will surely benifit in many ways.
12.0	Rencently, an interesting topic have aroused a heated debate among our public: whether people should follow their ambitious dream or focus on achieving realistic goal.
12.0	The answers vary from person to person.
12.0	Some people think they prefer to go for the ambitious dream.
11.0	However, I believe that it is wiser to choose realistic goal in my life.
5.0	TO begin with, the realistic goal allows people to have consistant passion to go for it.
8.0	As we know, the realistic goal always involve our basic demand of life, such as the salary we want to get, the grade that the students want to reach.
8.0	Facing the fundemental requirment, we tend to achieve it in the short time and it actually does not hard to get compared with the ambitious dream.
8.0	So we are more likely to keep passion untill we reach these goal.
8.0	In contrast, if we prefer to go for the ambitious and unrealistic dream, we do not know whether it can come true eventually.
8.0	Thus, facing the endless of destination, we are hard to persist it.
8.0	For example, when I was preparing for the exam in order to enter an elite university.
8.0	In a 3 month, I held the goal in my mind that I can enter the unversity and I tried my best to revise the knowledge.
8.0	The result is I achieved the goal after three month.
5.0	Furthermore, going for the realistic goal is conducive to planning the next step in our life.
8.0	This is because realistic goals always are earier to achieve and when we get them we can set up next realistic goal, which allows us to move forward to have a better life.
8.0	On the contrary, the ambitous dreams always are far away from our basic life, including improving our society or electing to the presidents.
8.0	For example, when I entered into my favourite unversity, I planned to get high GPA in order to apply for a better graduate school.
8.0	It can be imagined that after I enter the graduate school I will plan to search a decent job.
8.0	From them on, I will have a high standard life.
1.0	To sum up, achieving realistic goal is a wiser opition.
1.0	this is because we always have passion and it can lead to a better life.
11.0	In mu opinion I think do some exercise is better than watching movie and reading book,cause do some exercise it's good for our healthy also we can find more friends also we can contact outside.
4.0	We need do more exercise rather than just watching movie for fun.
8.0	In the American almost people use exercise way to remission pressure a lots of people choose do some exercise after working.
8.0	If we choose relax by watching movie will let yourself more fat and more negative as you know if you don't do some exercise your body will be very fat, long time later you will admire others muscle and you will become self-abasement and befraid of do some intercation with others.
8.0	So we need choose a  best way to relax ourselves rather than choose a comfortable way to relax.
4.0	In China has a very famous actor is YuYan Peng when he was young he is a really fat boy,leg him be afraid of to face others.
8.0	When he became do exercise accorading his hard training now he his a pretty good body.
8.0	What ever may betide he still went to gym may be work very late or has a bad weather.
8.0	No thing can stop he do exercise.
8.0	He said he likes excercise this is a part of life in his life.
8.0	Also go to gym can let people become possitive.
4.0	We know wrok or study let us very tired we need find a easy way to relax ourselves,although watching movie let us comfortable.
9.0	We just can choose sometimes to do that,in nomally life we need choose do exercise to relax ourselves.
9.0	Also we know watching movie for along time is bad for our healthy why not choose a good way to relax ourseleves.
2.0	Finally I want to said we reading or watching movie can let us learn something but healthy and good body it's the most important in our life so do more exercise just can good for you.
12.0	In my opinion, it is better for the parents to spend the limited time on things such as having fun playing games or sports with chikdren.
12.0	My reasons are as follow.
6.0	First, children have a lot of study work in school already, so they need rest during their time at home.
7.0	Thus, if parents still keep pushing them in activities related to schoolwork, they would feel exhausted
3.0	It is common that we award some scientists or some singers or actors because of their ipressing achievements.
3.0	We even give the amimals that are trained in the zoo.
3.0	As a result,  everybody needs reward.
12.0	Some people maight think that it will make children who work hard only for money, however, I am not in favour of this statement.
11.0	As far as I am concerned, it is not bad for children to deserve reward.
12.0	Here are my reasons.
5.0	Getting reward encourages students to work for higher grades.
8.0	It is nice for children get extra gift when they are envoled in study all day and all night.
8.0	In other words, if they cannot get reward after they get good grades, they will quit working hard because they are not aware of the importance of studying.
8.0	Especially for the one who are in low grade, they have not have the point of study for their future.
8.0	So, giving money quite motive them to get good grades.
5.0	On the one hand, the rewards, money given by parents, wil probably make kids get habits of mangement of  saving money.
8.0	It is wise for children who rise habit of making good use of money, in the meantime, the parents can as well get chance to educate them how to use the money.
8.0	On the other hand, the children will  also understand the meaning of earn for the staff they desire instead of asking parents to purchase for granted.
8.0	Take me for example, I exchange what I want by meanings of studying hard, it makes proud of myself.
10.0	Someone may wonder if money will lead students to cheat for highger grades in order to get money, however, it will not be a problem owning to train by teachers and parents from a very young age.
2.0	Nomatter which kind of reword, it needs proper level, too much or less will always genergate disadvantages to children.
3.0	First we talk about relax.
12.0	"In my mind,I think relax is human ""body"" relax with ""spirit"" relax."
11.0	The means we has two think need to relax when we have the real body.
12.0	So i disagree the viewpoint.
4.0	For example.
8.0	I'm a student, I need study everyday and no time to waste.
8.0	this means that school spirit needs a high degree of concentration.
8.0	We all know when we get the high drgree been a long time,In the process cannot feel,but after the degree we will feel very tired.
8.0	"This kind tired is ""spirit"" tired."
8.0	This kind feel maybe you don't have feel on your body.
8.0	you wrist is not sour,leg is not heart.
8.0	but you still think you relly tired, you need something to relax.
4.0	Talk about argument.
8.0	watch the movie and read book is nice mod to relax.
8.0	But does those mod can realluy relax the spirit?
8.0	I don't think so.
8.0	Read the book still  let you feel tired.
8.0	if you stay one way to read,how can you really has body tired?
8.0	Like you read a novel the ups and down of the plot,your mood follows the books plot.
8.0	You will feel tired when you finish reading.
8.0	I think everybody have this feels before..
8.0	"so how canyou think you really""relax"".movie is same thing between reading."
4.0	For another, Physical exercise can let you feel the tired, this everyone knows.
8.0	but on top.
8.0	we have sometimes the body is good and the mind is tired.
8.0	So the means we can switch.
8.0	The physical exercise can let you mind,spirit relax.
8.0	If you play the sports with your friends,You will feel happy.
8.0	happy is really nice emotion can let your mind relax.
8.0	maybe after this you body tired.
8.0	But you mind really excited,How can you say this is not relax?
1.0	So i think.
1.0	we need both those things to relax
3.0	With the gradually improving of our society, we begin to attach importance in our life qualities.
11.0	For this controversial issue, some people think it is not essential for young people to be good at planning and organizing, because the priority of young people is to study hard.
11.0	As far as I am concern, however, the ability of planning and organizing should be considered as an important ability for teenagers today.
5.0	Admittedly, as a student, we should attach more importance in our study rather than improving our ability about plan an organize.
8.0	Because with the improving competetions in modern life, students should study hard about their major and get concrate fundation about their knowladge in order to prepare for the future career.
8.0	But there is no doubt that nowadays social competetions are becoming fierce than before, which means a good student should be equipped with multi-faces, ability rather than only focus all himself(herself) on study.
8.0	In this regard, concerning more on how to plan and organize is necessary.
5.0	First, planning our daily life can help us save more time.
8.0	There is no doubt that mordern life is very complex.
8.0	Compared with former people with limited problems to be dealt with, nowadays young people have more serious troubles to be comsidered.
8.0	Take myself for example, I am planning to continue my study abroad, which means I have to prepare several exams about my it, such as TOEFL and GRE.
8.0	In this regard, I have to squeeze some time in my daily life to review the exam points.
8.0	It is important for me to be equipped with ability to plan my daily life, so that I can finished all of my work excellently.
0.0	Second, If we are good at organizing, we will easy to get good grade in our school.
0.0	There are many precious opportunities in our school to express ourself, such as join in some group.
0.0	In this regard, if we are good at organizing, we can become a leader in this group, which can express or capacities more easier.
7.0	Take my cousin for instance, thanks for his exce
3.0	The past few years have witnessed the fact that the prssure burdened on children have become heavier gradully.
3.0	In order to put their children at a priority stage in school, many parents force the kids to spend more time doing homework or engaging in sports.
3.0	So here comes a debate that whether children should be given more time doing whatever they want?
11.0	From my perspective, I do not think this method is a better choice for kids.
12.0	Here are some examples to illustrate my view of point.
4.0	First of all, doing homework can help children receive higher grades in school.
8.0	Typically, teachers will assign some homework related to the content taught in the class.
8.0	When children are doing these assignments, they will try to recall what have been taught during the day, which can enhance their grasp of the knowledge.
8.0	So they are likely to get higher grades in examinations.
8.0	On the contrary, if children just do whatever they want such as playing computer games or watching TV when at home, they will quickly forget the knowledge taught in the class.
8.0	For example, my friend Kenneth used to play computer games as soon as he got home back from school, seldom finishing the homework.
8.0	So he always had a poor performance in exams.
8.0	However, having realized the importance of study, he managed to give up computer games and do homework on time.
8.0	It does not take a long time that he made huge progress in gades.
4.0	What is more, participating in sports activites can guarantee a healther body for children.
8.0	After a full day's study, students may feel tired mentally.
8.0	If they can join a sport activity, their minds can be relaxed and their body can be strenthened.
8.0	However, if the let the children do whatever they want, they are likely to choose to lie on the sofar, eating snacks and watching TV, which can do harm to their health.
8.0	Imagine that A boy who studies during the school time and still sitting on a chair when at home, he is likey to become fat and get some diseases related to a lack of exercise.
4.0	Admittedly, we can not stifle the interests of children.
9.0	But that does not means we can let them do whatever they want most of the time.
9.0	In fact, parents can set aside some time to let the kids to do so.
2.0	In conclusion, I do not think children should be let to do whatever they want
3.0	I disagree students are more infulenced by their teachers than by their friends.
3.0	I think students usually talk about their problem with friends, therefore I think students are more infuenced by their friends.
11.0	We will respect our teacher and teacher can't know us in life.
5.0	The firstly, if I have problemand I will talk about with my friends, because we are peer, we can try to know why.
8.0	In my opion, I think we are in the same age, so we can understand others what means in talk, and I usually share my interest things with others and my bad things.
8.0	So my friends know my everything.
8.0	But I can't share my things with my teacher, they sometimes don't understand me and they will crtise me.
8.0	They usually only ateention on my score in the school.
8.0	They can't help us happy.
5.0	The sceondly, last summer, I has a text and I can't pass in that.
8.0	So I'm so sad, in this time my best friends came to know what happen.
8.0	He told me this things so smalls, I should forget this and be better.
8.0	But my teacher only ask me why not pass, I thank his spokes so bad.
8.0	So I think if we have some problem, we usually share with our friends.
8.0	Friends always can give us good consequence in the end time.
1.0	So I think friends are more influenced for us, we together do everything, such as play basketball, play football,and study.
1.0	We are grow in the same time, and we have same interest topic in life, and we can share our experence with each others.
11.0	I disagree that watching a movie or reading a book is better than doing physical exercise.
11.0	Following is the reason why i think that.
12.0	Firstly,not only doing exercise can keep us having a good feeling but also can build ur body,we can play basketball,football,tennis.
11.0	some of them should strong body and some of them need you behave and think quickly.
11.0	And then,doing exercise is easier than watching a movie because you can relax yourself by doing exercise everywhere.
12.0	But for watching a movie or reading a book,you should find a place where is quiet or go back home.
10.0	Finally,i think doing physical exercise can make you to recognize more people and make more friends which can keeo you having a active attitude to life and learn 'Never give up'.
6.0	Altough watching a movie or reading a book can really make you realx and you need them in your life,they can not instead of the functions that doing exercise can bring to you.
9.0	There is no doubt that life is the most value thing for us,so we should keep us healthy and make our body stronger.
9.0	sometimes doing exercise may make you tired and injuered,but if you keep on it,you can find happness and not care about the pain.
2.0	In general,we can adjust ourselves and make us realx and free by all of them.
7.0	But it dose
7.0	ont mean that it is better to relax by wat
11.0	In our morden life, the opinions lf celebrities, such as famous entertainers and athletes, do have big influence on both young and elder people.
11.0	But in my opinion, I really agree that those ideas are more important to younger people than they are to older people.
5.0	The first thing I want to talk about is that what the younger peaple have experienced is obviously less than older people.
8.0	Because they are younger, they can learn less from what they have experienced by their own.
8.0	But as the older people have live on the world for dacades of years, they see more and they hear more so that they alway judge things by their own instead of listening toother people just like those entertainers and athletes.
8.0	So I can say that those talks are less important to the oider people.
5.0	What's more, now that the internet technology is too advanced, those younger people always put their eyes on their mobile phones.
8.0	It is easy for them to get many informations through the internet.
8.0	And we all know that now many teenagers are addicted with surfing the internet, and many of them like many famous people.
8.0	They see them as stars.
8.0	Because they like them and hope that they can get more support, they are more likely to believe their stars and what their stars have said.
8.0	But as for those older people, they don't really care about what is new on the internet, and they also do not interested in those stars all something.
8.0	So they will heard about less of the celebrities.
2.0	So really agree the statement that the opinions of celebrities, such as famous entertainners and athletes, are more important to younge people than they are to older people.
11.0	I disagree with the opinion that people are more willing to give help to the struggling strangers in the current society.
4.0	There are three aspects that account for it.
8.0	First of all, helping the the struggling strangers could bring a lot risks.
8.0	To be honest, there are more and more crimers who are prepared to ask for the money in a bad way.
8.0	For instance, there are so many news revealed that when a old man laid down in the street, someone kind sent him to the hospital, but the old man grabed the helper and insisted that the helper is the harmer who pulled him down.
8.0	Therefore, the old man asked for the money for curing.
8.0	And the one who helped may get in a big troubler.
4.0	Secondly, the parents always tell the children to protect themselves and not to be nosy in the current society.
8.0	That means the education today is lack of advocating the significance of helping each other, even the strangers.
8.0	I'm impressed with that.
8.0	One of my friends called Alice had told me a story that when she went shopping with her mother someday, they met a man who said he was so hungry and needed help so much, and her mother just let her leave quickly to get away from any potensial troubles.
4.0	Last but not the least, everyone is so busy and get in a great competition.
8.0	There are so many tasks to be finished, so that they always hurry up and don't care the struggling strangers a lot.
8.0	For example, if you are a lawer, you have to spend all the week to perfect the contracts or to discuss the cases.
8.0	You don't have enough leisure to do what you want to do.
10.0	To sum up,
3.0	In this age,more and more parents choose to award their children if their children get good grade in school.
12.0	But I don't like this method to bring up children.
11.0	I think it will not work and even can cause bad effect.
5.0	The support of this idea always emphersis that we should stimulate children to get a better grade.
8.0	Without this encouragement,they will be less motive in study.
8.0	However,what I want to view on this problem is that our children should be hungured for not money but knowledge.
8.0	What makes them put themselves forward was not the profit they get,but the desire to become a better person.
8.0	Aiming at money is very dangerous,maybe one day we stop to give them award they will not continue to learn.
8.0	"Secretary Zhou once said:""I want to read for fighting for a stronger China!"""
8.0	It is this determination that makes his dream come true.
8.0	If he had been a person lived for money,he could not reach his great achievement.
5.0	The other reason for oppositing this idea is that our children don't have the ability to exert the money he earnd.
8.0	Children use money to buy toys he like playing,candy he want to eat.
8.0	All of these things are not good for his study.
8.0	We are all born to like enjoying life,but in our youth it is not a right time.
8.0	We should try our best to chase our dream,do what we can do to improve ourselves.
8.0	We shoundn't be content with a little achievement,addicted in the little reward we have.
8.0	If you give your child money for their mark,they may think that I'm good enough,it's time for fun and joy.
8.0	It will damage his willing of hardworking .
2.0	So,I think we should not give school-age children miney for their high grade,we should tell them their real duty and what they should do.
3.0	In China, all parents have a deeply longing to receive excellent acadmic recorde of their kids from school, desiring their kids to go to first-rate universities.
3.0	Therefore, a considerable number of parents will give their children money as a reward for getting high grade in school.
11.0	I disapporve of this opinion, as this behavior will bring about some dawbacks.
6.0	First of all, offering money to their kids will make them become utilitarians.
8.0	Utilitarian refers to a person who work just for  nothing but money.
8.0	Every time children get good grades in school, their parents reward them with money.
8.0	They will get an idea that study is for money.
8.0	This idea makes them thinks money is paramount.
8.0	As a result, when they gradually enter the society, they do things only for money.
2.0	Another relevent reason used to support my opinion is that kids will study for money instead of learning knowlege.
3.0	The society's foucus on the education systems is becoming more and more bigger.
12.0	Also, the functions of the teachers are geting more significant as well.
12.0	For the personal perspective of the influence from teachers to students, it is much more of the influence from their friends.
12.0	Here are some of my opinions.
4.0	To begin with, friends are the peers for those teenagers.
8.0	They have the same age and the similar experience in most of the time.
8.0	According to this, friends may have the same poin tof you as the students have.
8.0	The ways that they thought about the situations are usally the same.
4.0	Secondly, the time that the students have with their friends is more than they have with thier teachers.
8.0	For example, in the day time, teachers are busy in teaching and marking the homeworks.
8.0	The stuff that they think about are study.
8.0	It spend less time to have a deeply conversation to those students.
8.0	There always have some extra students that the teachers can not noticed in all the time.
8.0	However, the friends of them are queit different.
8.0	The students can hanging out with their friends, playing with friends and talk about the things that they loved.
4.0	The last thing is, the teachers always educate their students and teach them the professional knowledges and something about study and courses.
8.0	The only thing that the students can learn is the study works.
8.0	However, the friends will not be that.
8.0	For instance, the friends can bring something new to those students.
8.0	Like some young girls have the opportunity for dressing up.
8.0	Many researchs had showed that most of the girls were learnt to change their appereaence, such us making up, or wearing pretty dresses to decorate theirselves.
8.0	That represent that the students can get more informations from their friends instead of the teachers.
1.0	In conclusion, students are more influenced by their friends rather that their teachers.
1.0	The more time they stay together, the more similar ages they have will affect a lot.
3.0	With the globalization of the world and the boost of local economy, travelling has become more affordable for many people.
11.0	There are some considerations that every one can take into account when planning their trips, that is, whether it is better to travel in their own country.
11.0	Some might contend that travelling in one's own country is more economic and convenient, making the trip more pleasant.
12.0	However, I would like to suggest that travelling abroad is more meaningful.
4.0	To begin with, toutists can experience distinct cultures by travelling to another country.
9.0	Although it is also interesting to look at different local customs and traditions in a single country, there might be different types clothes, landscapes, or even ingredients for food that can never be found in the home country of the travelers.
9.0	Hence, having a trip in foreign countries truly reveals the diversity of human civilization and is particularly benefit for boosting mutual understanding between various cultures.
4.0	Moreover, the opportunity to practice foreign languages is also a noticeable reason.
8.0	At present, it is not uncommon for people to find native speakers as foreign language teachers in their own countries.
8.0	Nonetheless, they should always bear in mind that talking to people in a foreign country is a totally different experience.
8.0	For instance, when I traveled to the UK last year, I found it is difficult to order food in restaurants, since people there tended to speak faster and less clear in daily life.
8.0	If young adults had the chance to travel in a foreign country for several couple of weeks, they would fefinitely make remarkable pregress in their oral language.
4.0	Last but not least, economy is an additional argument comes to mind.
8.0	In a relatively developed country, travelling can be quite expensive, like booking for hotel or buying tickets.
8.0	So it might be a wonderful choice for people to go countries where commodities are not that expensive.
8.0	They actually face less economic burden in those countries, and as a result, thay can make the trip even more enjoyable.
8.0	However, that is also a good challenge for them to imrove and use the economic knowlege that they learned, provides that they still go to the developed country.
8.0	Here is a example given by my friend, my friend was invited to the USA by his cousin.
8.0	Firslt, he planed to book the luxary hotel and the vehicle but he found that his father just gave him three hundred dollar as the travelling fee.
8.0	So he tried his best to regulate the money.
8.0	Finally, when he came back , there were still twenty dollar last.
2.0	Due to the aforementioned ground, I firmly believe that it is a wise decision for people to travel to foteign countries, instead of traveling demestically.
11.0	Today, there is a hot topic: whether it is neccessary for young people to gain the ability of organizing and planning due to the complex modern life.
12.0	Answers vary from people to people.
11.0	Some people think that the young are not suppose to learn how to plan and organize things.
11.0	Contrary to their views comes my perspective that the ability of planning and organizing plays a vital role in young people's mordern life.
5.0	To begin with, being good at organizing and planning helps the young have good performance on study or work.
8.0	It is acknowledged that the ability of organization make things in order, which can help people to distinguish the urgent events from unimportant things, thus they can address their assignments effectively and efficiently, then comes the good performance of work and study.
8.0	For example, my monitor in high school is a people who is good at organization.
8.0	The ability helps him solve problems one by one from the emergence to the normal issues, which makes him be awarded as the most excellent student per year.
5.0	Secondly, young people who learn the ability of planning can keep balance of life and work.
8.0	To be specific, in modern life, the young is under high pressure of overwelming assignments of studying and working.
8.0	A well-organized people can separate the study or work to their entertainment, which benefits he or she to really enjoy their life in each condition.
8.0	By contrast, if people cannot plan their life, too much work would let them stressed out.
8.0	Their distraction on entertainment prevent them from finishing task quickly.
8.0	In this case, they cannot play well or work great neither.
1.0	In general.
1.0	I think young people should study planning and organizing skill which helps them have a better life in modern society.
3.0	Nowadays people attach higher importance to their education, and some parents even offer money to their children for each high grade they have got.
12.0	As far as I am concerned, this is not a great idea, and my examples are listed as follows.
5.0	First, if money is regarded as a reward, students will only try their best when their parents make a promise to give them money when they achieve high scores,thus, students will feel undesirable to make efforts if there is not an award like this.
5.0	Secondly, once this mearsures are taken, students will ask for more and more money as they grow up, which contradicts what their parents imagine at first.
9.0	A fixed money is not enough to motivate them to get high scores.
9.0	Only when they can get more money will students have motivation to devote themselves into their study, in order to get a higher award.
3.0	With remarkable progress of people's living standard, people begin to achieve higher goals in the long life time.
11.0	Some people claim that we should follow ambitious dreams rather than realistic dreams.
11.0	As for me, I am totally agree with the point, because chasing an ambitious dream can make people stronger.
6.0	To begin with, trying to achieve ambitious dreams allows people being strict with themselves.
8.0	It is because you have a higher goal, and to achieve that hard work you have to put your wholeheart into it.
8.0	You will force yourselves to work diligently and try harder to achieve that goal.
8.0	While a more realistic goal means lower standard so you are more likely to take it for granted once you have failed, and change your goals frequently.
8.0	To illustrate, my friend Tom always follows realistic goals.
8.0	So he changes his dreams according to the reality.
8.0	He hoped to get a B grade in his math exam last year, but he thought it would be easy, and din not try hard.
8.0	So when he failed the exam, he just hoped to get a C grade next semaster.
0.0	Moreover, chasing  more ambitious dreams makes us more competitive in future social life.
0.0	Since you have set a high target for yourselves, you will compete with others, put more effort to get what you want.
0.0	And you will not let yourselves fall behind others.
8.0	You want to be the best, and your sense of competition forces you to compare with other people all the time.
8.0	In this circumstance, your desire to sucess will surely distinguish people from their peers.
8.0	Take my mother as an example.
8.0	She always wants to be the photopragher in her department.
7.0	So she wil participate in many competitions about photos, and through these activities
7.0	she gai
3.0	In such a modern society which is highly caring about the education.
3.0	Nowadays there is a popular issue that whether it is the core of improving the education of universities by spending more money on salaries for professors of universities.
3.0	And this evoked an drastic debate among people.
3.0	Some of them hold that colleges should not spend more money on the salary of professors bacause they are already have a higher salary than many peopple in other professions.
11.0	In mt opinion, however, it must be difinitely for professor to have a higher salary, and my reasons are given below.
4.0	Although spending more money on the salaries for universities professors could cause a problem or even a shortage to the college a economic pressure, this would be still worthwhile sacrifice for a better education of all of students.
4.0	First and foremost, the professors would like to have more patience and being more likely to help students.
8.0	There was an old saying in China which is 'Money could make ghost to run some errands.'
8.0	Maybe it is not sounds good to describe, but it is the fact in such a society.
8.0	Because professors will gain more money, they must become happier and merrier and to be positive to do their work and that will must be high efficiency.
8.0	And this not only has benefits for professors but also better for all of the students because we can study in a more efficient class.
4.0	Moreover, increasing the salary of professors also enable professors have a closer relationship between students.
9.0	It is not hard for professor to pay more attention and more time to educate students, and this will enable students and professor to have more time and opportunities to communicate.
9.0	Then the whole campus would be a happier college which contains nice professors and students.
2.0	From the above illustrations, at the very least, although the conomy of campus is fairly significant, to consider the concept of education, the college should sacrifice all they could pay.
3.0	Recently, people 's interest in the debate that the government should spend money on improving the internet access than on public transportation has been accumulating.
3.0	different people present dissmimilar opinions.
3.0	As for me, i deem the government shoul spend money on public transportation.
12.0	My reasons and examples are listed below.
4.0	One reason why I chose literature is that better transportation can make dewellers  become more effective.
8.0	In every morning, when you get up go to work, better transportation can allow you arrive early.
8.0	You will have more time to prepare , using a better condition to work.
8.0	Take myself as an example.
8.0	Usually I have class at 9 pm, but the bad traffic condition compel me to get up at 6.
8.0	I will spend time on waiting for bus and traffic jam, It is really disturb me, because i don' t have enough time to sleep and lower effeciency.
4.0	Another relevant reason used to support my opinion is that, it can save money for government.
8.0	As i know the facilities of internet are pretty expensive, because now we still need some breakthough on internet.
8.0	Take my uncle as an example.
8.0	H e works in communication company as a researcher, as he konw we don' t have a complete way to improve our hole internet.
8.0	some facilities we need to import, so it is pretty expensive than to improve the transportation system.
4.0	the final reason invovles the recognition that improve the inernet will distroy our environment, because many fibers are undergrand, if we want to improve it we need to dig most part of fibers in the city.
10.0	Also take my uncle as an example, he talks to me many fibers on undergrand so if we want update, we need gid them all.
2.0	in conclution, improve trasnportatiom have more advantages than intenet.
3.0	When I was in high school, my chinese teacher leave me a deep impression not for his wonderful aprreciation in articles or  his devote into class but the radical opinion about social or political news.
12.0	In my mind, spending lots of time in expressing his own subjective and radical views is waste of time and this behavior will also exert bad influence to students own thinking.
4.0	Firstly, spending lots of time in unrelated things is not appropiate for teachers in class.
8.0	In China, studying pressures is not only from peers competence but also from the heavy studying tasks.
8.0	In a class, only 45 minutes, students may need to learn a whole chapter about caculus or to appreciate a long classic essay wrote by Lu Xun.
8.0	Obviosly, it is hard job for teachers and students.
8.0	Thus, spending the class time in unrelated topic will lead to negative influence to what they should finish in this class.
8.0	Not only students cannot fully undersdand the content which may caus misunderstanding in other topic,  but also they need to spend much more than 45 minutes to learn by themselves.
8.0	Just like what my Chinese teacher did in my high school, when he needed to explained the examination or textbooks, he always digressed and talked about his own view about recently social news.
8.0	Consequently, the average Chinese grades in my class reduced significantly.
4.0	Secondly, teachers own social or political view may be too radical to build right values in students.
8.0	When they talke about their own view, they will just express their own intact thought without thinking twice.
8.0	It is hard for them to distinct which is suitable for students and which is not.
8.0	Some radical view just present in front of students without screening.
8.0	These radical views will influence students own values, such as my Chinese teacher think all crimes shoud be exerted, which is too boo
4.0	Admittedly, sometimes teachers social or political view can attract students and even sometimes those view can help students understand social phenomenon and arise their independent thinking about social.
10.0	But it is hard for teachers to measure the degree exactly.
1.0	To sum, I admit that sometimes teachers own view can help students.
1.0	However, that may greatly influence the normal class and even cause negative influence to students own values
3.0	I think this is not always a good idea.
3.0	It depends on occasions.
3.0	And I may explain some of the situations that is easily noticed in my perspective.
3.0	If a student can get more enthusiastic in study when awarded money for his grade mark, this method seesms very effective.
3.0	But things are not always what we expected.
3.0	For instance, If a child is rewarded money in terms of his grade mark, he may try extreme ways in getting a higher grade mark.
3.0	He may spend more time in studying how to get a higher paper mark than studying how to get more knowledge.
3.0	The extreme ways as I mentioned may go as cheating, such as using phone searches or conspiring with others in an exam.
3.0	This is definitely not what the reward is for.
3.0	This is just one angle of all the drawbacks of the money-rewarding-encouraging system.
3.0	I reckoned that there must be more hidden effects.
3.0	You may think it a deal, in which your child pays his efforts and win your money.
3.0	You may only judge his efforts by his grade marks brought home in the end of every semester.
12.0	But you don't realize that you are teaching him a wrong concept,that studying is not for skills but for money.
6.0	This thought may be useful when you are teaching him Capitalism, right?
8.0	This method may be improved, as I concerned.
8.0	Why use money, a symbol of capital and business?
8.0	You had better get your kid know that he or she is studying for him or herself, but not for what he/she gets in his/her hands right after each examination.
8.0	Instead I think you can give them reward in spiritual forms.
8.0	You may promise a boy a trip into the nature, you may present a book to your little girl that she always wants to read.
8.0	In this way, your child can know that studying is for knowledge and skills, with which they're capable for social works later when they enter the society.
0.0	I think a rewarding system is necessary in encouraging a child to learn, but you should give them right things as rewards.
0.0	These things are aimed at digging out their further interests for the world they are getting to know, but not telling them that they are going for the rewards themselves.
0.0	They are going for their life.
0.0	Money-oriented minds are what we hatred today, but in this method we may inperceptibly push the idea into our children's minds.
0.0	It's a controversial idea.
0.0	It is good on some occasions, but on other occasions we must make some special change in the rewards we are giving our children.
0.0	It must be an inspiring thing, not a compensation for his sacrifice, as I emphasized.
3.0	Nowadays, eith the development of the society, people's lives have been improved a lot.
3.0	And parents thesdays have been more and more concerned about children's education.
12.0	As a result, whether parents should let their children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.
11.0	From my perspective, this opinion is reasonable.
5.0	First of all, Let children to make mistakes and learn from them can help them to have a better future when they grow up.
8.0	Children who do things by themselves and make mistakes can help them to gain a lot of experience and improve themselves.
8.0	Then they would be aware of the mistakes they made and have stronger impression.
8.0	So next time they won't make the same mistakes.
8.0	For example, students who study alone and make mistakes would heip them to learn quickly since the mistakes are made by themselves rather then being influenced by their parents.
8.0	After several time of making mistakes and learn from them, they could hardly forget what they learned so that they could get a better grades without others help.
5.0	Secondly, it can cultivate them not to be afraid of hardness.
7.0	When children first make a mistake, they may be afraid of making mistakes again if parents sto them immediately,  however if not they
12.0	More and more parents give thier children money to buy what they want,but how much the kids should get from their parents is a little difficult to decide.
12.0	Therefore, their parents choose a very fair way that the money is depended on their acadmic performance.
4.0	In my opinion, it is not a very scientific means to select,but we can not find another way to decide.
8.0	From an ancient time, the workers got their income from the employers.
8.0	If the employee finished a perfect job, they could get more than the other who did worse.
8.0	This behavior is very fair to the all people,so do the parents.
8.0	If the children want to get money to satisficate themselves, they have to work better and their work is to study.
4.0	Because the parents can not accompany their kids to study at the school,so they can't spy on the kids to see if they do a good job,but they can judge from the result of the school life.
8.0	The result is their grade of each subject they study.
8.0	Becasue of the difficulty of each subject, it is hard to study by themselves without listening to the teachers, so if they want to get a high mark ,they need to try their best to follow the teachers every class.
8.0	Therefore, the high mark they got is the sign of working hard.
8.0	And they are supposed to be awarded for their hard working.
4.0	Meanwhile, it also teaches their kids that if they want to own what they want they have to work hard.
10.0	It is not impossible to achieve their dreams,but if they do not try their best, they may fail and lose the chance to get higher.
2.0	As I mentioned above, offering the school-age children for each high mark they get in school is not very scientific,but it is  the most suitable way for the parents to decide the money and teach their kids the truth of the society.
3.0	Energy conserveation has been a concern for many people and it causes a topic that whether the most effective way for goernment is to encourage energy conservation is increasing the price of gasoline and electricity.
3.0	This debate divides people into different camps with different opinions, and some people would like to hold the opinion that increasing the price of gasoline and electricity is a good way.
11.0	However, when it comes to me, I consider funding researchers on new energy sources is better.
5.0	First and foremost, new energy sources makes it possible for people to save more energy.
8.0	To be more specific, since there are new energy sources, when people drive their car or take the public traffic, the pollution will be less sicne the new energy is solar and wind power which doesn't have bad effects on the environment.
8.0	In opposition, if the government spend nothing on the new energies, people will just use gas as their main sources to drive cars, and thsi can cause great dioxide released by the car will affect the environment a lot and cause global warming.
8.0	For example, according to one of my father's friends, who always driving a car that depends on the electricity as power source, he says that when he drives this car, it will releases less carbon dioxide to the environment, and then the environment can be protected in an efficient way.
5.0	In the second place, with more new energy sources, the government can get more access to fame that will bring them money to develop more new sources.
9.0	This is because when a country and other countries will pay them a lot since this technique can protect the environment a lot, they then will have mroe money that can not gain more fame, but also they can use this money to develop even more new energy sources that can protect the environment.
9.0	This pattern will finally lead to a good circle that can help spend no money on new sources, then when other countries have developed the method to utilize the solar or wind energy, they can just play to use this, in this way it will even cost them more and bring a heavy burden to this country in the long term.
0.0	Granted, it may be reasonable and attractive that some poeple claim that the goernment should encourage energy conservation by increasing the price of gasoline and electricity, since if the price of gasoline is increased, then less people will drive a car to go out which will be beneficial to the environment a lot.
0.0	However, it cannot hold water, since nowadays people's lives are really busy, so some poeple will still dirve a car to go out.
0.0	So I am still convinced by my standpoint that  funding researchers on new energy sources is better.
3.0	Nowadays, most workers are under much pressure of  work everyday.
3.0	Some people claims that they might feel more satisfied when they have a lot of different types of tasks to work on in the workday than when they do the same works in the whole day.
3.0	On the contrary, other people disagree with this statement.
11.0	In my opinion, it is more beneficial to workers to do many different tasks all day long.
4.0	Admittedly, doing the tasks during the workday also has advantages.
8.0	workers could be able to have a lot of spare time to do activities they want.
8.0	They can watch movies, play computer games, watch TV programs and so on.
8.0	But in my point of view, working on the tasks all day long has more benefits for workers.
4.0	First and foremost, doing the works in the whole day could enable workers to finish their tasks better.
8.0	This is because they have more time to work on their works.
8.0	For example, I have a aunt who is a middle school's teacher in my town.
8.0	She works very hard everyday because she needs to prepare her teaching tasks and correct students' homework.
8.0	Because she does these things all day long, she is able to do these things very well.
8.0	As a consequence, she could attain much more salaries than other teachers.
8.0	So it turns out that doing the tasks all day long could allow workers to finish their work better.
4.0	Secondly, working on the tasks in the whole day can also let workers relax themselves.
8.0	This is because it is not too tired if workers can do their work slower than those who works only in the worktime.
8.0	For instance, I have a cousin who is a computer programmer.
8.0	He is required to finish numerous tasks everyday.
8.0	However, he does not have to do all of them in his worktime because he always does them in his whole day.
8.0	Consequently it is not too tired.
8.0	So in my opinion, doing the works all day long could allow workers to relax.
2.0	In conclusion, I firmly believe that working on the tasks all day long is very beneficial to workers because it could let them relax and do their tasks better.
3.0	In order to the fact that teachers have the opportunities to express their knowledges and opinions to their students during the classtime, many people states that students are more influenced by their teachers.
12.0	However, I hold the oppose opinion that students are more influenced by their friends.
5.0	First of all, teachers do have more opportunities to repeat their thinking to students in classtime.
8.0	But, if students who are dislike this teacher, they will not listen to the teacher.
8.0	My own experience can better illustrate this idea.
8.0	When I was learning in the high school, I did not like my math teacher.
8.0	He always like to express his boring ideas about some news and repeat it again and again.
8.0	I think I was coming school for learning knowledge, not to listen the boring aspect.
8.0	Therefore, I always do my homework when my math teacher did not talk about math-related knowledges.
5.0	Moreover, student spend more time with their friends and during their playing, young people are likely to be affected by their friends.
8.0	For example, I was addicted to play basketball with my friends.
8.0	I spend almost all time playing basketball, watching basketball games and talking about basketball stars with my friends.
8.0	I clearly remember that on a sunday afternoon, I was playing basketball against a team from another high school.
8.0	In the begining of that game, we lost a lot of scores and I was frustrated of this game.
8.0	However, in the rest time, my friend Tom encouraged me and said never give up.
8.0	I was inspired by his words and finally, we won that game.
0.0	Admittedly, teachers could influence their students when they are teaching.
0.0	However, this way is not efficent for many students did not listen to their teachers.
0.0	those students will listen to their friends who they like to play with.
3.0	Are nowdays people more willing to help the stuggling strangers?
3.0	As far as I'm concerned, the trend of rate of help others may develops towards a complete opposite direction.
3.0	For one thing,with the rapid development of technology and economy, people living in the modern society gradurally are separated into a variety of isolated island.
3.0	The relationship between people are becoming fragile and insincerity,which resuleted by the more and more competitive working environment and the lack of the communication to the strangers or just their neighborhoods.
5.0	For another, the lack of a sturdy legislation is one of the reson why some people are afraid of helping struggling strangers.
10.0	Unlike the past period, a man who come across an old man lying on the road may firstly think about whether he is a fraud,without which he may be asked for repayments for no reason.
5.0	Last but not least, even though there are lots of barriers in fronts of humen' kindness, there are still a space remain to the warmness and reliance.
7.0	What the social and people need is the correct guide and a more rr
3.0	For today society, there is a heated  conversation about young people today.
11.0	Some people believe that young people's decision can not effect the pattern of society.
11.0	Some people think that young people's opinion will change whole society, even change this world.
11.0	For my determine, I agree with the latter.
5.0	The first reason that why I support second one is : young people's decision can help human to advance.
8.0	I believe that old rule and old pattern have to be broken, and then society, which mean human can get a progress.
8.0	And those old rule and pattern will defated by some creative ideas and action.
8.0	There is an example about my oppinion: when Bill Gates was a student in the high school, he was created a new work and rest system and sale to his school.
8.0	The reason that why he can created this system is : he dares to doubt old system and to innvate his new system to replace it.
8.0	And now he create his own company, his innovation has changed this computer world.
8.0	So young people's doubt, young people decision really can change this world.
5.0	My second reason is : young people's decision can be more tally with today's society.
8.0	When the times changed, people's hobby and job are changed too.
8.0	Young people growth with their  contemporary, and they will know what kind of things that this society require.
8.0	For example : In the 20 century, people were more focused on survival.
8.0	But today, people are more focuse on quality of life.
8.0	In you give young people money and help them to entrepreneurship, they might have better choice than old people, because they clearly to know what is marked demand.
7.0	So, that is why I think young people's decision is really important for teh fu
12.0	there are a variety of ways to learn about a person.
9.0	the things that person is fond of may reflect some aspects of him, such as books and movies he favors, while the opponents may cast doubt on it due to the complexity of human nature.
9.0	From my perspective, we could be blind to the real nature of a person  only by judging form the books and movies he likes.
3.0	As the society is changing at a extraordinary speed, and modern life is becoming more and more complex, I personally think that it is essential for young people to have the ability to plan and organize.
4.0	Firstly, having the ability to plan and organize can help young people go directly to their destinations without making detours.
8.0	Planing and Organizing before start can give people a clear mind to understand what their aims are, so they won't wondering around not knowing what to do next.
8.0	Take my brother's experience as an example.
8.0	Last summer, my brother planed to go to Italy on a trip in August.
8.0	Then he did research at home and planed the dates, accomadations and the expense in July.
8.0	So he enjoyed the trip very much while some of his classmates who didn't have a plan had an bad experience.
4.0	Secondly, equipped with the ability to plan and organize, young people get used to the changes of the fast developing society.
8.0	As everyone knows today's society is very complex because it is changing very fast.
8.0	So plan and organzie before the changes take place can help young people lead mooth and steady lives.
8.0	For example, my father used to be a young man.
8.0	When he married my mother, they realized that only when people have their own houses can they not worry about the basic needs of their lives.
8.0	So they planed to open a clinic to earn money.
8.0	A year later they finally had the money to buy their own house.
8.0	So the ability to plan and organze can really help people to lead their steady life.
4.0	Thirdly, the ability to plan and organize can help people to develop the relationships with others.
10.0	It is some leaders who have the ability to plan and organzie, and they usually have some business friends because they are outstanding because of their ability to plan and organize.
2.0	All in all, it is very important for young people to be equipped with the ability
3.0	With the rapid development of our society, the science and technology has improved a lot.
3.0	So, the Internet has become a necessity of our life.
3.0	Then here comes the question, whether does the Internet provide us with valuable information or not?
3.0	I pretty sure to hold the view that the Internet helps us a lot to get much good information.
11.0	And the reasons are as follows.
4.0	First, Internet is really convinient for students to get more information to study and benifits them a lot.
8.0	In the past, the only way for students to gain knowledge is to listen to the teachers at the scene.
8.0	However, nowadays, more and more redio clips are uploaded on the Internet, and students can watch them online at everytime.
8.0	I take myself as an example.
8.0	Now in my school, when we learn some courses, there are still some Internet courses to supply what we have learnt at school.
8.0	And Ican just watch them in my dorm whereas going to the lecture.
4.0	Secondly, the Internet helps public to gain more news about what happens around the word.
8.0	The falicitate of Internet brings people more ways to get known about the news.
8.0	Different types of applications can provide different kinds of information to our phones, computers or other electronic divices.
8.0	Besides, the Internetion is very fast for us to gain more information during a short time.
4.0	Although accessing to so much information actually creats some problems, it's not a big trouble.
8.0	Maybe people always surf on the Internet and cannot stop, as long as we oursleves or someone else can stop us.
8.0	Or there are some bad information on the Internet, as long as we can distinguish.
8.0	Surfing the Internet is not a big deal.
7.0	In conclusion, I think the Internet has more valuable information
3.0	Recently, a controversial topic have aroused a heated debate: whether young people today are more likely to spend their time and energy in improving the world than young people in the past.
3.0	Some claim that juvenire in the past is more inclined to contribute their efforts to the world.
11.0	However, i hold an opposite perspective that young people now is more willing to improve the world.
5.0	First, young people currently have less energy to improve the world.
8.0	Benefited from advenced technology and developed economy, young people now have less stress to concrn about.
8.0	They need not worry about how to make their life and how to support their family.
8.0	And this permits young people now to concern more about the value of their life and how to benefit the world.
8.0	For example, people living in the past had to help their parents cultivate crops even when their were only several years old.
8.0	And the rest of their life was spending on struggling to sustain their family, which make him have no time to think about what he can do to the world.
8.0	However, young people nowadays are free of these living pressure.
8.0	They have the liberty to do everwhat they want.
8.0	Therefore they have energy to comtribute their life to the world.
5.0	Second, young people now have more efficient access to what they need to reform the world.
8.0	With the development of education and pedogagy, student now can aquire knowledge more efficiently and conveniently.
8.0	Now we can obtain the knowledge spanning across a tremendous number of subjects with a slight click on your mouse.
8.0	And what is more, we can have more access to the university to study what we want.
8.0	However, in the past, people have trouble to travel from state to state, not to mention traversing ocean to study aboard.
8.0	Hence, toung people at the time can not even attain the frontier knowledge and they certainly did not have the capability to make a difference to the world.
3.0	Recently an interesting question has been attached much concern to: should perents give their children money for their high marks?
3.0	Answers vary from one person to aonther.
3.0	Some claim that students should be pay if they getting good grads after a long-time hard working while others oppose to the idea that students get high mark is reasonable and they can maintain it and do better without giving them extra money as reward.
3.0	To my way of thinking, students are worthy of being offered money after getting good grades.
11.0	My viewpoint is based on the followibg reasons.
5.0	Formost, having a high grade is a reflection of the doing hard work diligently before the exam.
8.0	As we all known, a small award is giving by parents can be a large encouragement for students.
8.0	Also it can motivats them to keep on it.
8.0	As a studets, I totally understand many sudents think study is a kind of ressigiment, which is pushed on by their parents and teachers, they do not really like sudying those boring text books.
8.0	Comparing to sitting in the class and study by rote movelessly they empressingly prefer to play basketball with friends on the ground freely without teachers' glazing and parents' shouting.
8.0	So those money are given by parenrts as reward for their diligence is very necessary to encourage them to study hard.
5.0	Secondly, many sudents are afreid of taking exams, so if they can gain money after a exam, maybe , they will feel btter .
8.0	Surprisely, they might expect the next examnation's coming, because they know that if their  proferme good, they can get something they want.
8.0	They will use the extera money to buy more useful books to enrich their horizens and improve their acdanmic performance on the next tast.
8.0	Even though they buy something having nothing to do with study, they will be happier ,which can help them be more energetic on their dull study.
7.0	To put in a nutshell, a student who is offered money from their parens for good grads perfo
3.0	Nowadays, some parents pay more attention on their chidren's grades or marks they get in school.
3.0	They connect their children's mark with money.
3.0	When the children get higher grade,they are happier and offer their children more money.
3.0	Whereas,when they fall in the exam, the parents will lose their temper and give less money to children.
11.0	I don't think it is a good idea to act like that for parents.
10.0	There are many reasons for me to disagree with them.
5.0	Firstly, it will misguide children's aim of  studying.
8.0	Parents offer their school-age children money will make the children misunderstand the purpose of studying for theire parents.
8.0	Learning the knowledge is the children's own thing.
8.0	if they don't make good marks , they could't get money.
8.0	Once their parents can't give enough money for them ,they will give up studying.
5.0	Secondly, it will decrease children's interest on studying.
8.0	Children are like a valid and clear paper.
8.0	If the parents give them more concepts on money, they will turn more concern on money, not on the knowledge of learning.
8.0	Learning is a happier and interesting thing in itself.
8.0	Interest is beneficial for the success.
0.0	So, parents should help children cultivate right concept on studying.
0.0	They should know the aim of studying and know that they should study for themselves.
0.0	At the same time, they shoud cultivate their studying interest.
0.0	Only after the children know why they are studying for and what they should be in the future, do they make a good success.
3.0	Nowadays friendship has been a concern for many people and it cuases a topic that whether compared with the ability to make new friends easily, the ability to maintain friendship with a small group of people is more important and decides your hapiness.
3.0	This debate divides people into different groups with opposite opinions, and some people would like to hold the opinion that making new friends easily is more important and decides hapiness.
11.0	However, when it comes to me, I consider maintaining friendship with a small group of people is more important is more important.
5.0	First and foremost, maintaing friendship with a small group of people makes it possible for people to be happier because of they help they receive.
8.0	To be more specific, when people have a small group of people, they can spend most of time together, then they can get to know more about each other, so they will have a good friendship in the long term, so everytime when they meet trouble or want to go out for fun, their frineds will always be there and can help them a lot or go out to play with them together.
8.0	In opposition, if they have quite a lot of friends, then the time they can spend with every friend is actually very few, so they may know very few about each other, and they can not get help at all when they meet some trouble.
8.0	For example, one of my my friends, who only has a small group of friend, he can talked a lot with every of his friends, and once when he lost some money and need to borrow money, he borrowed money from his friends and his friends are all willing to lend him becasue they trust him.
5.0	In the second place, with a small group of people, people get more access to better study in order to help them gain happiness.
8.0	This is because when people only have a small group of friends, although they may spend a lot time with every friend, but since the total number of friends is not much, so they will have more time for studying, and which can help theml learn a lot and find a job easier in the future, as a result of that, their happiness in the future will get increased.
8.0	In opposition, if they have a lot of friends, they may spend too much time with them which leads to a bad result that they have no time for studying, so they will learn much less than those who has a small group of people.
8.0	Let' s take one of my father's friends as an example, who he was in colledge, he only has a small group of friends, so he spent less time with friends and more time to study, as a result, today he lives a very good life.
0.0	Granted, it may be reasonable and attractive that some people claim that the ability to make new friends easily is more important, since with more friends, they will have more chances to start a business or make an investment in the future.
0.0	However, it cannot hold water, since their new friends only known them for a small amout of time like a few months, so their friends are unlikely to give them chances to make an investment and start a business together.
0.0	So I am still convinced by my standpoint that maintaining friendship with a small group of people is more important is more important.
3.0	There are a various rangs of jobs in the world.
3.0	Some people work on diffrent tasks while others do almost same tasks in the same way in a whole day.
3.0	Some of them like theire conventional work.
3.0	However, a lot of people belive various tasks are more delighting and satisfactory.
11.0	In my opinion, I agree that doing defferent kinds of work is better.
4.0	Firstly, ther is no doubt that doing similar jobs all day is extremly tedious.
8.0	Imagine ehat kind of job deamands workers to do similar tasks all day - they are usually boring and tiring.
8.0	Even if a person like what he is doing, as a human being, it's completely normal that he needs some other stimulations to keep vigorous.
8.0	How can people be satisfied when they feels bored and tired?
4.0	On the other hand, different types of tasks are interesting and fresh for workers.
8.0	When workers change the task occasionally, they may feel like taking a break from the pressure of those previous tasks even though they are still working.
8.0	Also, changing things can physically spur people and bring excitement according to some researches.
8.0	That's why I think doing different tasks can make workers interesting.
4.0	Another reason is that different types of tasks are always challenging mainly because workers might be unfamiliar with some kinds of tasks.
9.0	However, they will acquire huge self-satisfaction if they can overcom the difficulties in their work.
9.0	The level of difficulties can be controlled by managers to be easy to overcome.
2.0	For those reasons mentioned above, I think workers are more satisfied doing various types of tasks.
3.0	In general, I think that parents give studets money as reward for their high grades is a good idea.
5.0	Firstly, a reward can encourage them to study.
8.0	Many prople think that school-age children may be not at a age when people need spend money for their lives, which means they don't have such huge requirement of consumption.
8.0	But as a common means of exchange, money means abilities to get things.
8.0	That presents a signal to children that if you work hard and reach the expectation, you can get what you deserve.
8.0	It's just like general employees.
8.0	And children can learn how to design their own expenses from an earlier age.
5.0	On the other hand, I don't think it's inapproprite that offering money can make children mercenary.
8.0	Building of sense of consumption usually is affected by parents.
8.0	Children are not born with malevolence, so they won't waste money without uncertain reasons.
8.0	If parents worry about that, what they should do is not to refuse to offer money as reward, but teach students to know how to use and save money.
8.0	Also the reward can be anything else, but this can't be the reason we think providing money is wrong.
2.0	In summary, it's a good idea for parents to teach children something important in life but not relavent to study by give such a gift.
3.0	When the children are adult, they need to face a question that how to choose job.
3.0	Some people will choose jobs that are similar to their parents' jobs, some people will choose a different job with their parents.
11.0	However, I think choosing a similar job wiht parents is better.
11.0	It is because parents' experience can help us and we can get more resource from them.
5.0	First, parents' experience can help us.
8.0	They have done this kinds of jobs long time, and have many kinds of skills  to deal with the different situation.
8.0	For example, my parents' job is selling books.
8.0	In a activity, I need to sell the newspaper to other.
8.0	At first, I didn't know how to sell it.
8.0	Then My mother tell me some skills that is used to sell books, and I used  it to sell my first newspaper.
8.0	So the parents' experience can help us accually.
5.0	Second, we can get more useful resources from parents.
8.0	If you parents' jobs is similar with yours, there must be some markets or sonsumers resource that you can use.
8.0	By this, you can be easy to improve your visibility in this industry.
8.0	In my thinking, if the industry of our jobs is same with our parents, our parents must say to their consumers.
8.0	In order to have a better relationship with your parents, these consumers must support you work and advertise for you.
8.0	Finally, many people in this industry will know you.
8.0	It is better for you.
3.0	occupation planning takes an indispensalbe role in career and parents all want their kids to have a secure job.
3.0	there is arguement that whether it is easier to identify what types  of career or job would lead to a secure and successful future .
12.0	in my perspective , to assert which type of job is beeter is getting more and more formidable because is has less categories of job and relatively stable business in the world now .
4.0	to begin with  inthe past the category of industries were very few and traditional .
8.0	so you nedd not spend much time to knowng which job is profitable .
8.0	for decades the species of jobs have diversified with the development of the technology .
8.0	by ways of illustration , cook was regards as a  rice bowl in the later and many people started studying cooking .
8.0	now , however , the cookis divided into many different types .
8.0	it is really hard for peolpe to decide which jobs they wantto take .
8.0	meanwhile the status of different industries alters at high rate of speed.
4.0	another reason is taht , the competiton are more and more serious now , the compition that realm of the each region of the society face is more strenuous while the information waves pound .
8.0	foe instance , a progress in IT makes it possoble for us to study , watch televison , shop , which urges the new profession becoes an overnight success.
8.0	on the other hand , there were many secure state - owned enterprisesin the past .
8.0	the economic growth today brings assws of private and foreign enterprises , which also signifies the increasing fierce compoetitio of the domain.
4.0	admmittedly , with a large number if internet forums , courses or training about the professional analysis and planning can help us grasp status and prospect of each industries , people can find the most suitable and  promising work.
10.0	nevertheless , initial success in career does not mean getting a fabulous job once and for all.
1.0	to sum up , with the close look , individuals are faced with diverse, ample career choices .
1.0	for these reasons , we can dra a conclusion taht distinguishing what type of job would be better is more sure previously.
3.0	The topic of education is always popular, no matter in the past time or now.
3.0	Parents would pay more attention on the education, bacause it is very important for children and it even can decide the future of kids.
3.0	Hence, every parent would try them best to educate their children.
11.0	In my opinion, I think educating children is easier than before.
8.0	This is because, as the development of society, there are more and more experts.
8.0	If we have some question about children, they will give us appropriate suggestion.
8.0	Second, because the living level is improved, parents themselves will have this realization to read a lot of book and study how to teach children.
8.0	Finally, the concept of education is making progress, children can enjoy better educational resource.
5.0	In the first place, our society is becoming better and better and human is developing too.
8.0	Now, there are a lot of professional people can give us answer according to our specific problems.
8.0	For example, when my younger cousin come into the kidgarden, she always like stealing the objects of others.
8.0	When her parents know about this news, they are very angry and critic her.
8.0	But after a while, my cousin still do the same things, it make her parents confuse.
8.0	Then they decide to ask the psychologist about educating kids for help.
8.0	They tell the whole process, and the psychologist tell them it is normal for children, bacause in that time, children are curious about the enviroments around them.
8.0	Sometimes, they do this things, it does not mean that they want to steal, they are just interested in this objects.
8.0	After that, her parents understand why she steal other things.
8.0	Thus, they tell the truth for my cousin, after a while, my cousin gradually give up this bad haits.
5.0	In the second place, nowadays, people are educated too.
8.0	Therefore, compared with the folk in the past time, they are totally can depend on their experience to educate children.
8.0	My friend, for inistance, like lying to her parents in one period.
8.0	Before, if children lie to their parents, they would punish them and warn them that cannot do this thing anymore.
8.0	The reasult is children will be afraid of their parents and in order to escape the punishment, they would lie more.
8.0	But my friend's parents would render her to tell the truth.
8.0	If my friend tell the real situation to her parents, they would not punish them, instead, they will be pround of her courage that she can tell the truth bravely.
8.0	Then, my friend would not lie anymore, bacause she knows that to be a honesty people will have reward.
0.0	In the end, the souce of education is becoming better and better.
0.0	Schools will help children become well-rounded person.
0.0	In the past time, schools just provide academic course for children and always emphasize the importance of getting good grades in every exam.
0.0	Thus, they usually ingore other aspects.
0.0	Consequently, children indeed can perform well ini exam, but other things maybe do badly.
8.0	But now, schools begin pay attention to other things.
8.0	For example, now, schools will teach children that they should keep a warm heart in everytime.
8.0	Because children affected by this concept, they would do other things.
7.0	Such as helping their parents do the housework or help
12.0	nowdays,the individuals,especially the colledge students who are very busy with thier study in the class or job given by their teachers feel tired in their life,they want to relax and take easysometimes , and in this way i think doing physical exercise is better for our to taking relaxe .
5.0	to begin with,when you feel tired and you want to  change a way to enjoy your life,doing physical exercise is not only  good for our mental heart but also good for our body ,through doing exercise ,you can pervent having a cold or other disease,therefore you can have a health body that you can exert more energy in your study and life .
9.0	foremosts,there is a positive attitude you can gain when you exercise beacuse exercise is a way to reduce pressure.
9.0	at last but no least ,we can doing exercise with our friend and family ,when we finish the exercise we can share the thing we met with them ,it is very important that what we can have another way of life when we take exercise and i believe we will make progress in daily life.
5.0	i also want to communicate about watching a movies and reading a book ,there is no doubt that many people like watching movie ,but is considerable that we will be addicated to it like smoking ,alse it bad for our eyes.
10.0	reading book can strenghthen our view of world that we can learn many vivd and novelty knowdelege we don't know ,but i think our head will bear load.
7.0	in a word,whatever you want to relax your daily life ,the most important is that you can ta
8.0	My View on Prarents' Way of Rewarding Children
3.0	Praise is a good way to motivate students.
12.0	Many parents have their own way to encourage their children to work hard on thier study and make great success.
12.0	There even some parents offer money as a praise to their school-age children.
12.0	As far as I am cincerned, money can never be a good way to motivate people.
8.0	The reasons are as the flowing:   First of all, giving students money may makes them feel that money is of great importance.
8.0	It will not help them to cultivate a proper and health outlook of money.
8.0	On the other hand, students may spend  the money on some useless or unnecessary things.
8.0	Secondly, students may not fully motivated just by receiving money and if they don't want money, they will pay less attention on their study.
8.0	Thirdly, there are many ways of motivation, for example, we can take them to a place they have been longing for a long time, or we can ask them what kind of gift they want most.
8.0	In this case, students will work harder and harder in order to get what they want and at the same time they will relize that their efforts is rewarding.
6.0	We all know clearly that money is essential to everyone's subsistence.
8.0	We can not deny that giving students money can stimulate them to pay more attention on their study to some degree.
8.0	However, from a long term, we need to come up with a more attractive and meaningful method to boost their learning.
8.0	That means patents should always care what their children needs and never use simple but useless or even harm ways to encourage their children.
8.0	Parents should help students foster a right attitude towards money and give more help and guidences on their study.
3.0	Nowdays, there is a kind of phenomenon that children are receiving money from their parents.
11.0	I often hear from the disagreement to this fantastic idea, for they think children are too young to own money.
11.0	Indeed, they should not possess much money, but they can benefit, if they gain little money for high grade.
12.0	Thus, I prefer to agree with the good idea that parents can offer their school-age children money for high mark.
5.0	First of all, children will be encouraged if they receive rewards like money.
8.0	During teenage, children are at the time when they are willing to study for the interest.
8.0	Imaging that if a child always gets the best grade in his class, but receives no rewards or the ones that do not fit him, what will he feel, and what is the motivation for him to continue to study hard?
8.0	Parents are always considering that they understand their kids enough, but the fact is that parents merely know what the kids really need, because the choices of themselves are something they really want.
8.0	Therefore, it is better to give their money to buy what they really want instead of giving nothing or making the choices by parents themselves.
5.0	Moreover, giving the money to the kids can help children develop the ability of financial control.
8.0	One day, children will become adults, so they will face the problems that how to earn money and how to save money.
8.0	If parents give the money to children as the prize, they will regrad these money as something they earn.
8.0	As long as parents teach them some financial skills, they will cultivate a good view of money.
8.0	Since only after experiencing the difficulties of earning money, children will understand how important to save money, and this virtue will help them become successful.
1.0	To sum up, although giving money to the children as rewards will bring some disadvantages, there are more benefits than we normally expect.
1.0	It is compelling that if parents and children carry out this behavior in a right way, children will derive tons of advantages in their future life.
12.0	I agree with this stastement, as we all know everybody make mistakes.
11.0	It is better that the children understand that and know how to deal with the mistakes.
4.0	If parents trying to stop children making mistakes, what they going to do is to tell them what to do , or giving punishment to their kids when they make mis takes, which could watn them doing do the same thing next time.
4.0	As far as I know, you definetely will do your own decition some day, so their are not going to be someone could tell you what to do , and what's right during your life time.
8.0	So for the parents, if they tell kids what to do all the time , it's no good.
8.0	Cause this action will make children don't think before thay act.
8.0	And don't know how to make their own decetion.
4.0	For the second one, giving children punishment after they do something not right, It is even worse.
9.0	All of these punishment and warnning stuff,will destroy children's confident, making them thinking to much before they act.
9.0	Which is not good either.
4.0	The most important point is making some mistake when your young is acutlly a good thing, First somr small mistake will not hurt anybody, but you need to understand it was not right to do that.
9.0	If kids can realized what they did wrong and start to think why it is wrong,and how to makr it right.
9.0	It could be a proccese of learning,which is usful and unique skill during the rest of their life.
1.0	So my opinion it let the children make mistakes and let them start to think about their own mistake and sart to know what to do by their own next time.
1.0	It is the most basic part of learning procces, and I believe this proccese will build up children's own personalty and habots which will give them a better life.
3.0	This is a epoch that goverments play a more and more important part in daily routine.
11.0	And there are a lot of fields that needs governments' financial support to push the program to a further way.
12.0	When it comes to goverment,we have to talk about how the government to spend their money.
12.0	There is a specific question whether it is more important for government to spend money on improving the Internet access than on commual transportation.
12.0	From what I have been through,I firmly hold the belief that it's important for government to better the Internet access.
10.0	The reasons are as follow.
5.0	The construction of Internet will cost a lot of money.
8.0	The better the Internet access is,the more information everyone will get from the computer,And with more information people get,they can enhance their skills and knowlege.
8.0	In this way,they can harvest the apple from the peak of the successful tree,Taking my friend,Josh,as an example to illustrate my perspective.
8.0	He is man who usually uses computer as a tool to gain the information he needs.
8.0	When he was a child,he used to go to the library to learn something that could not learn in school.
8.0	But the update of information was too fast to follow by only using the resource in the library.
8.0	When he grew older,he found that using Internet to learn something new was a more convenient way and the Internet could provide something library could not provide.
8.0	Up to now,he likes to using computer to serach the information,but he thinks there still are a lot of improvement people can do to make the Internet better.
5.0	The another reason for my opinion is that Internet access construction is a huge program.
8.0	There is few corporation has fund and time to make endeavours to improve the Internet.
8.0	Moreover,the better the Interner access is,the more people are willing to use it.
8.0	In this way,government can increase their revenue by improving the Internet access.
8.0	For example,in the past,when the Internet came to China,there were few people to use it and the profit of this industry was low.
8.0	But,things change a lot.
8.0	Now,there is an increasing number of people who are willing to use compuer at home.
8.0	So,if the government can improve the access of Internet,it will increse the user of computer and more and more people will spend money in computer.
8.0	And then the government can maks a profit.
2.0	From what I have refered above,we have to admit the fact that it is important for government to improve Internet access and it is more significant than public transportation.
3.0	There is a saying goes nowadays that people today are more willing to help the struggling strangers.
3.0	In the newspaper or on the TV, we can often see some reports that a boy jumps into a river bravely to rescue someone who fell into the river carelessly.
3.0	We also see some news that one man gives all his money to the students who can not afford to go to school.
11.0	I agree on this statement for the following reasons.
4.0	First of all,we can see that the amount of people willing to help others increased greatly in the past ten years.
8.0	Take NGO for example.
8.0	There are many None Government Organaization nowadays,who are determined to help people in need all around the world.
8.0	They help African children by offering food and water.
8.0	They give medical treatment to people who live in less developed countries for free or charged very little money.
8.0	They try their best to save endangered animals like tigers in Asia so to protect the environment,which is vital for every one.
8.0	The amount of this kind of people increased day by day,we can see there are more then a hundred NGOs all over the world.
8.0	I am often deeply moved and encouraged by those person,because they are selfless and always willing to help.
8.0	This is the most obvious evidence for the statement that people today are more willing to help the struggling strangers.
4.0	Secondly,with the great development of the technology and economy,people today become more abled to help struggling strangers.
8.0	We can not only offer other money or food,but also provide technological services.
8.0	For example,when someone get lost in a strange city,if we don't have a smart phone,it will be very hard to show them the way.
8.0	But with the development of varies APPs,wecan easily show them a picture or map of the city,so that he can find the way easily.
8.0	In the past,many people were willing to help,but they didn't know what to do.
8.0	Nowadays,there are many ways and methods to help others,so people are more inspired to help strangers.
4.0	Lastly,with the development of the internet,people can share their experience of helping others on the social net work.
8.0	This can help a lot to encourage people become more kind-hearted.
8.0	When we see what people do on the internet,like helping an old struggling lady or a missing child who can't find his parents,we are often deeply moved and begin to consider what we can do in our daily life.
8.0	Take a story in wuhan for example.
8.0	A girl posted a picture of an old lady sitting near a trainstation,whose daughter were badly injured in a fire.
8.0	The old lady makes flowers and dolls everyday,trying to sell them to get her daughter cured.
8.0	But she can't find a good way to sell them and has a miserable life.
8.0	However,after the girl posted the picture of her on the internet,many people are willing to buy those flowers and dolls online to help the poor lady,so she sells about a hundred flowers now everyday.
8.0	This story are a very good example of the benefit of internet in making people more willing to help.
0.0	Althoug many people argue that the many people are selfish nowadays,I still believe that there are more people who are willing to help.
0.0	And I will also try my best to help the struggling strangers around me.
0.0	Maybe I can started by offering some food and water to the homeless people who can only sleep in the park and sleep on a newspaper.
0.0	Now I am a student,but I believe I can do more things when I go to work.
3.0	Is the technology render children less creative than before?
3.0	Could the development of technology enhance the children's interests in novel things?
3.0	As a university student who won the schools competition about the innovative technology three monthes ago, I strongly believes that the development of technology enhance my capability of create.
12.0	Since the technology not only can boraden up the horizon but also can provide the condition for us to create.
6.0	On the one hand, the technology enables us boraden up our horizon.
8.0	To be more convincible, by knowing some new technologys like the know the machine that can purify the water, we will know that the water can be purified by the artificial ways.
8.0	Then it enables us to open up our mind in this way, then the more methods which can purify water will come up in our mind.
8.0	So obviously, the new technology open a new field of vision.
8.0	And if it did not have any technology about the water purification has been invent, to say nothing of coming up with some new product that can purify water, it will be more difficult for us to think of the aspect of water purification.
8.0	As a result, the high technology open up our mind in some new area to help us create new product easily.
2.0	On the other hand, the technology provides us the better condition to invent or create more things.
9.0	To be more specific, one hundred years ago, we are less creative than now, for instance, at that time, we did not think of any thing about the phone, for the rough circumustance and the barren knowledge about the electirc area.
9.0	We did not have sufficient facilities as many as we have now, even if we did not have the metal crust of the phone and circuit borad--all
12.0	I disagree the statement that watching a movie or a book better than doing exercise to relax.
8.0	Above all,it is vital to understand where anxious feeling come from.
8.0	As we konw,society is full of more and more pressure.
8.0	Each of us concentrade on job so that our brains are exausted.
8.0	that is why it does not work if you want to relax by reading a book or whatch a movie,which still contain subsidential plot or knowledge need to be learned.
8.0	That way get in vain because of the identify resourse.
8.0	In the oppsite side,doing physical exercise make a difference,by which our body could get relaxed.
8.0	Meanwhile,what has bothered
11.0	Nowadays, study is very important for everyone, and a good learning environment can make student study more effectively.
12.0	many people think  sthudents study with groups more effectively than study with alone. l agreed with this statement.
6.0	first, as we know, work alone is always very broing, when  face a problem nobody can help me. if we work with groups we can make a lot of firend, and also when we have a problem we can helo each other.
8.0	for example, before l training with alone, l think training alone l can training more effectively.
8.0	onece l was go to play mach l lose the first round, l m so sad, afer the calm my coach told me l training is very monotonous, l need training with a group that l can know my disavantages and advantages.
8.0	So l change my mind, and training with group, in the groups l make a lot of firends and we share experment.
8.0	After few month l win the a lot of match.
8.0	So l think do to anything with groups can more effectively than work alone, because we can get help from others.
2.0	Second, study with groups can make student study more motivate, in the groups some students have a same topic, so when we study is very boring we can talk about we interesting things that make study more interesting.
3.0	Nowadays people have many ways to motivate children to study hard in school.
12.0	Some parents may take their children to travel around after they get a good grade in school, some people may take their children to a restaurant for a nice meal, and some parents may give little presents children want.
11.0	There are so many ways parents can use to encourage children to do better, among all the methods, I think offering school-age children money is the worst idea.
4.0	Primary, parents need to make children aware that being hard-working is not something worth being praised but something to be needed.
9.0	Everyone in the society need to work hard for resposibility.
9.0	Parents need to cultivate children's habbit of doing well.
4.0	Futhermore, by giving money to children to motivate them may have potential harm.
8.0	Some of the children may become addicted to obtaining money, and when they are not able to control their desire, they may lose their principle to gain more money.
8.0	Children may even start to steal money from parents' pocket or from their classmates.
8.0	In consequence, giving children money to encourage them to study has more disadcantages than advantages.
4.0	Finally, if parents really want to encourage their children for good perforance, they can choose other activities which are healthier.
9.0	For example, parents can take their children abroad and travel.
9.0	Not only in this way can children learn a lot of things but also gain much fun.
2.0	In a nut shell, even if by giving children money to praise them may seem to be easy,
7.0	I think physical exercise can relax more than watching a movie frist of all physical esercise not only felax the mood but also felax the body
7.0	it can your healthy is very good For example when i was tired my eyes are very tired if i watching a movie my eyes will not relax
7.0	so i will choose physical exercise it can relax my eyes and my body
7.0	The second physical exercise can make me more healthy and make me strong because the body is the most important for people
7.0	so i think physical exercise is very important For example if you watching a movie
7.0	so long you think movie is boring but physical exercise is so interesing you can physecal exercise with friends together you can make more friends i think it's very incredible in the end
7.0	i think the student not only good study but
7.0	also physical exercise is very well  only in this way you are a  good student
3.0	Is it a common scene to you that crazy fans tend to endeavor to defend their idols' opinions of all kinds of media like Twitter?
3.0	In addition, most of these crazy fans are young people.
11.0	Older people, on the contrary, are more mature than young ones.
11.0	They tend to have formed their own value systems, which means that they are inclined to what they believe and will be less influenced by the opinions from celebrities.
10.0	All in all, I fully believe the opinions of celebrities are of greater significance to young people than old ones.
5.0	First and foremost, young people tend to be more naive and more likely to be inspired by the 'nice' words said by celebrities.
8.0	On the contrary, older people will care less about what celebrities have said, because they know the opinions don't apply to all conditions.
8.0	For instance, there are two basketball players.
8.0	One is 10 years old while the other is 20 years old.
8.0	If they are both aware that Kobe Bryant once contributed his success to his diligent practice starting from 4 a.m. in the morning, the younger boy is prone to act like Kobe did if he wants to get the same achievements.
8.0	But for the older boy, things are differing.
8.0	He must have undergone some failures through his sports career and he is aware that there are many other keys to success other than hard work, like genius, innate potential as well as good opportunities.
8.0	Therefore, chances are that he will possibly stick to the former training plan which suits him best.
8.0	In brief, the younger boy is more inclined to be inspired than the older one.
5.0	The similar situation comes to celebrity brandings.
8.0	If a product is sponsored by a superstar who people adore, the product shows a tendency to be more welcomed.
8.0	When Stephen Curry becomes the spokesman of Vivo, a Chinese mobile phone brand, a great quantity of young girls who adored Curry for his loveliness scrambled to buy the phones.
8.0	They'd like sponsor their idol with the purchasing behavior.
8.0	Nevertheless, older people are more rational and they are aware that the price of the phone will increase after the introduction of Curry and they are less willing to pay for the plus brought by celebrity charm, so they will turn to other brands with higher cost performance.
3.0	With the fast-changing development of society and economy, high-level education has become an increasingly signifcant role, which provides numerous qualified workers and employees for factories and companies.
3.0	Nowadays, some people come up with a solution to improve the quality of education.
11.0	That is offer more money for university professors.
11.0	However, I do not agree with this plan is able to make many contributions to the improvement of universities, because there exist other appropriate options for us: giving more budget to school facilities and students' resources.
4.0	In the first place, well-organized devices lay a foundation for a university's educational quality.
8.0	As is known to all, almost all subjects are supposed to be equipped with great devices for students.
8.0	So they are able to perform well on their fields.
8.0	For example, studens who are major in biology are expected to possess their own microscope to research microbes, otherwise they can only study biology from books or the Internet.
8.0	It is evident that they are able to learn more knowledgeby perfect equipment than just reading books and original and creative ideas will come into being during the research process.
8.0	Therefore, buying more well-qualified devices is obviously a better choice.
4.0	In addition to that, universities should pay more money on recuiting better students than salaries for professors.
8.0	It is likely that the key to the best universites is excellent students.
8.0	Graduated students are people who are able to present universities' apparence than professors.
8.0	Therefore, if universities are willing to spend more budget on discovering potential students, like offering promising schoolarship and advertising, universities will benefit more from these actions.
8.0	Hence, there is no point for colleges to spend money on salaries for professors.
4.0	Last but not the least, universities are probably supposed to use these moeny on courses for professors rather than improving their salaries.
8.0	As we all know, universities professors are one of most well-paid and respectable careers in our society.
8.0	They already own wonderful lifes that majority of people are not able to dream about.
8.0	On the contrary, they are still expected to be trained in some aspects.
8.0	It is reporeted that a professor in a Beijing college abuse his students, which is totally unacceptable.
8.0	So we should spend more money on professors' training program.
1.0	To put it into a nutshell, spending more budget on professors' salaries is clearly not the best option to improve the quality of education.
1.0	We can put more money on devices and students
3.0	Recently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people: which goals should we foucus on, ambitious dreams or realistic goals?
3.0	Opinion vary from person to person.
12.0	Some people claimed that people should concentrate on achieving realistic goals.
10.0	However, I would stand on their opposite side and I believed that people should seek for the ambitious dreams.
12.0	My viewpoints can be elaborated as follows.
5.0	Firstly, ambitious dreams can cultivate a desire to advance.
8.0	If people have an ambitious dream, people would be careful to do anything in daily life and foster an attitude to win.
8.0	Then they will be more motived and more easy to achieve the dream.
8.0	When people meet troubles, they can overcome them quickly.
8.0	The reason is that they think they can achieve the anbitious dreams in the future, these problems are not a big deal.
8.0	Once they ahcieve the dreams, they will feel a sense of accomplishment and they will achieve higher goals next time.
8.0	For example, I was a shy girl in my high school and I was so normal that my classmates didn't notice me too much.
8.0	However, I set a dreams that I must get the offer of Wuhan controversary of Music.
8.0	After that I studied became harder and I was very strict to myself about the time of practing.
8.0	Because I told me my goals every second.
8.0	I felt very energetic and finnaly I got the offer and frist prize of the context of piano.
5.0	Secondly, ambitious dreams can make people suit the social environment well.
8.0	It is full of competition in the social environment.
8.0	To make people adapt to the society quickly in the future, they should set the ambitious goals.
8.0	However, if people treat everything without ambitious minds, they would probanly be ignored in this competitive society.
8.0	For example, I had a brother in Wuhan University and his was very clever.
8.0	But he was very lazy and didn't want to set an ambitious dream.
8.0	He just wanted to graduate and find a normal work.
8.0	Finally, when he stepped into the competitive society, there was no company wants to hire him.
8.0	They would rather to hire the person who has more ambitious goals.
10.0	To put it ina nut
8.0	education children is a more difficult task today than it was because it not only refers to teaching conditions  but also is influenced by the environment in which children study.
8.0	when it comes to compare the difficulty of educating children today with in the past, most peole will choose the former due to children are easily addicted to all kinds of internet, games, smart phones and so on.
8.0	However, education children in the old times also were confronted woth lots of problems.
8.0	so the statement is incomplete and incorrect.
6.0	it;s undeniable that nowaday teaching children is hard because there are many other things except study that attract children's eyes.
8.0	it's the advanced conentions that makes taking control of children hard.
8.0	accordign to the researches, many elementary teachers complain that many students play smartphones in class but not to listen to teachers and play online games after school instead of finishing homework.
8.0	what's worse, since children have an access to make friends on social website such as facebook and twitter, they learn some bad habbits such as cilence from bad guys on the internet.
8.0	so all thes things add more weight for teachign students because teachers will spend more tome on protecting young students from all kinds of the outside disturbances.
11.0	Young people are ofen told not to do this and not to do that.
12.0	And I would think about a question that whether the rules that societies today expect young people to follow are too strict.
11.0	Some people would say yes, but I think it is not too strict.
5.0	For the first reason, the rules are good for the young's safety.
8.0	For example,the young are told not go to bars.
8.0	This is because there are many people would may be dangerous there.
8.0	Since people in the bars would probably drunk, they may hit the young by accident.
8.0	Also, the alcohol is bad for the young's bodies, so telling them not go to the bar is a way to protect them.
5.0	Scondly, the rules can help the young to keep healthy.
8.0	Take an instance, it is common that the young are not allowed to go to internet bars.
8.0	I thinks this is good for the young.
8.0	Staying in frount of the computer screen without moving for a long time is very harmful to the young's eyes and badies.
8.0	And when they playing computer games in the internet bars, there would be no parents to let them stop.
8.0	Thus, they might probably even forget to have their meals.
8.0	And their badies would get hurt in this way.
8.0	For this reason, the rules is a method to help the young to keep healthy.
0.0	Admittedly, the young would have fewer things to have fun because of the rules.
0.0	However, the rules do not affect all things in their life.
0.0	The young can still go outside with friends to strengthen their friendships and have fun as well.
0.0	And the posibilities of being hurt would be reduce becuase of those rules.
0.0	So I think the rules that societies today expect young people to follow are not too strict.
7.0	They not only stallow the young to do many things
3.0	In China, many parents reward their school-age children for getting a high grade in class by offer them money.
11.0	General speaking, I don't think it's a good idea.
12.0	The reason I will discuss on the below.
5.0	First, giving money isn't the best way to inspire a younth.
8.0	Child need to know they are learning for themselves rather than for bounce.
8.0	Taking your children to a famous resteraunt or having a family weekend can significantly encourage the little boy or girl in study, says, make them happy.
8.0	Money can't buy happiness directly, so offer happiness for your child for congratulation.
5.0	Second, money always make you crave for it.
8.0	And that idea boost your child for make money but not for study.
8.0	So, if you stop offer them money, they will feel frustrated and unmotivated.
8.0	So just offer them money is not a good idea.
0.0	Since the reason we discuss above.
0.0	Offering money is an irresponsibility way to reward your children.
0.0	Try to play with them will aggressively encourage them in study.
3.0	In comtemporary world,there are a growing number of approaches to relax yourself after a busy and exhausting day.
11.0	These mathods can be generalized into two categories,mentally and physically.
11.0	As for me, I contend that relax by doing physical exercise is a better way.
12.0	The followings are statements of my point.
5.0	Firstly,the more we exercise,the more we sweat.
8.0	When sweats coming out from our bodies,we may all undergo a process that our sense of stress is going away.
8.0	Exercising physically can have us temporarily forget those unpleasent things and drive away our negative additude with sweats.
8.0	Take professional athletes for instance,most of them have a more energetic look than those politicians on TV.
8.0	Apart from releasing our pressure,doing physical exercise can also build up our own bodies,both beneficial to body and ment health.
5.0	Secondly,although reading books or watching a film may broaden our horizens and seem to be easy while doing these,they don't really give us a energetic feeling.
9.0	Don't you feel much more tired after reading or watching videos?
9.0	That's because these activities still consume your energy of brains,you need brain to analyse messages,you need brain to memorize these automatically, which make you feel more sleepy rather  than restore your emphasis of doing things.
2.0	Apart from the comparasion with mental exercise and the strengths of physical exercise,the advantage that physical exercise can form a more outgoing character for a person can also contribute to supporting my idea.
7.0	We see that it's more likely that a easy-going person play different yypes of sports,whenever you have a good character,you will get more chance of having a
11.0	In my views,i disagree with the following statement.
11.0	I think it's better to relax by doing physical exercise than relax by watching a movie or reading a book.
5.0	At first,i think physcial exercise can keep our heathy and keep our boby fit.
8.0	It can relax our brain when we feel so tired.
8.0	Well,sometimes when we are so tired we do need quiet environment to keep our heart calm,but we also need physical relax after exercise.
8.0	And i think it's more important than keep calm to do something.
5.0	Secondly.
8.0	Maybe watching a movie or reading a book is not good for our eyes.
8.0	To the contrary,this action maybe cause short-sighting.
8.0	And it makes our brain more and more tired,beacuse we will spend too much time seeing a unmoving thing,maybe it cause our tired.
2.0	After all,what's the meaning of relax?
8.0	it stands for seeing the outside world to make you breathe fresh air and make your eyes pure.
8.0	So there is no doubt that doing physical exercise can satisfy this need and is really to make your boby relax.
8.0	But i don't mean we can not relax by  watching a movie or reading a book,i just think we better do physical exercise                 Not only can doing physical exercise make your boby healthy,but also it can make you relax.
12.0	Many people concerned that people do their things .
9.0	and there is particular concern regarding that they do the different things but just do the few things well.
9.0	I agree with the statement that people who do the different things and they cannot do everything well,because in nowdays,too many factors attract people's attention and people living standards improve,there is no resolution to do a thing well,almost people can do anything they interseted.
7.0	The first reason is that people,who live in a c
11.0	From my point of view, I disagree with the statement that it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than that relax by doing physical exercise.
11.0	Reasonable as it may sound, it is in fact ill-conceived.
11.0	My opinions are as follows.
4.0	First of all, reading a book or watching a movie doesn't amount to better relaxation or entertainment, it may take much more energies.
8.0	Many books are prodigious, like Ulysis, thus requiring much better energy to fully understand them.
8.0	Movies, similarly, are sometimes so moving that they make you bale, not relaxed at all.
8.0	As is more often the case, you are really engaged when reading a book or watching a movie, and your brain is calculating, imaging and reasoning all the time.
8.0	The energy they cost will only be more instead of less than doing physical exercise.
4.0	Besides, physical exercise is another effective way to relax as well.
9.0	It contributes to fully strech of your body, especially after a tiring day.
9.0	When you have finished your work, leaving the table, why not go out and take a walk or jog, which is much more fun than reading a book under the dull light or wathcing a movie in the crowded cinema.
4.0	Last but not least, the statement ignores the variety interest of people.
8.0	There are people who love reading, and there are definitely people who are opposite.
8.0	You cannot expect Tyson to relax better when reading than boxing, or Newton to enjoy more fun when diving than studying physics.
8.0	The statement is too subjective and supply no substance to confirm it.
0.0	To sum up, wathcing a movie, reading a book or doing physcal exercise, are all good choice to relax yourself.
0.0	The preference indeed varies from person to person.
0.0	There will never be a guaranttee that a specific activity will lead you to relax better.
0.0	Hence, unless it provides more evidence, I'd say it is intenable.
3.0	At present, there're many successful people around us.
12.0	Some people think that successful people only do the things that they know how to do well.
12.0	However, others reckon that the successful people is courageous.
12.0	In my opinion, I approve the latter standpoint, because successful people always tend to accept new technology  ,new values and they are addicted to adapting to new environment.
6.0	First, successful people are inclined to accept new technology.
10.0	Now high-technology exist in our life everywhere.
7.0	For instance, in the past, teacher only use the paper books to educate students, however, now successful people use the new technology to invent online courses, a lot of students are
12.0	Ofcouse it's a way to children who get a high mark,but all of them just are false work,their cannot represent the children's own abilities at all.
11.0	A high mark symbolize you are a excellent student, but if you don't live up to you name,the life will make you hollower.
12.0	Only the ture man can live a enrichment world.
5.0	Instead of offering money,their also have a great deal of methodology to improve grade.
9.0	Do not let just one way restict you thinking,all roads lead to Rome as well.
9.0	Life is just one time,I think live a passion and work-harding life is more funny than a negative and hollow life.
5.0	It's said let life be beautiful like summer flowers and death like a auturn leaves.
9.0	A flower which is in full bloom need collect water and sunshine each days but not grow fast as flash.
9.0	Only quantity change lead to quanlity change,so work by gradual accumulation  is the merely and connect way to get a high grade.
2.0	Money is just a tool but knowleadge is a door.
12.0	I think offering school-age children money for each high mark they get in the school is a good idea.
11.0	First,it is a good way to praise the children.
12.0	"Money is an actual thing that is useful than a couple of words like ""You did a  good job""."
12.0	For children,it is also a way to show that they are equal to their parents--they are respected because they made money by their own hand just like their parents.
4.0	"Secondly,it is also a good chance to teach your children ""no pay no gain""."
8.0	If you keep this habbit your children would understand that everyone can get what they want by apporppriate hard-working.
8.0	That is more effective than parents tell them directly.
8.0	Children can go through this experience by themselves and they will remember that for their whole life.
4.0	Another interesting thing is that parents can see what children will do with their money.
8.0	When a school-age child get the money he earned,he should learn how to use it correctly and usefully.
8.0	Parents should observe the altitude and the action of the children when they are going to use the money.
8.0	If they are confused or use the money unaproppriately,parents can correct them at once.
4.0	Also we knew that some children are self-esteem about their grades or appearance when they are teenagers.
9.0	Praise them by money is a good way to encourage them.
9.0	"When they get upset about their study life or get unsatisfied about their apperance(especially for girls),try to use the money to have a good time and tell them:""What you did earned this money,and you can have fun with your life by using what you gained."""
4.0	For children that are not so willing to study,parents can count the money once a month and have a great talk with children about their study situation.
10.0	That is clear to see how they are going on with their study.
0.0	And these are some of my opinons about the offering money to children for their high scores.
0.0	I think it is good for children's growth and communication with their parents.
0.0	Hope parents can think about more respectful and creative way of family education,for it is really impacful and important fo a child's whole life.
3.0	As we know, the advertisements are the best approach to introduct the commorces to all over the world.
3.0	We can know the characteristics of the goods by just watching the advertisements.
11.0	With the accelerate of the pace of the technology, the advertisements also become better than the past.
11.0	However, I think the realistic goods are not such good as the discribtion in the advertisements.
4.0	In the first place, the advertisements use a myriad of PS technology and vivid audial mechine make the food material looking better.
8.0	For instance, I  am a big fan of the orange juice.
8.0	According to the advertisement on the TV, the oranges that were used in making orange juice are so big and vigorous and the farmer directly use the fresh oranges making the juice.
8.0	However, I feel not tasty when I get this orange juice.
8.0	This is simlar to the other orange juice and I even can stimulate that this orange juice is just made of the suger wather and other materials.
8.0	I am highly disappoint with this good and I think I am treated by the advertisement.
8.0	This experience teach me that the discribtion in the advertisement is always not true and makes products seem better than what the products really are.
4.0	In the second place, a lot of advertisement like to use famous star to attract the fans.
8.0	Take myself as an instance, I have watched Kobe's basketball games since I was a little boy and I am a big fan of Koby.
8.0	I only by the basketball shoes which is advertised by himself.
8.0	Even I feel this shoes has no difference with other shoes, I still think this shoes is better than the others because these shoeses are weared by my favorite star.
8.0	In the fact, the star effect can make you feel the products are  much better than the realist.
4.0	Finally, a good advertisement obviousely can attract increasing number of people to buy the products.
9.0	Nevertheless, the fact that merchants use advertisements to tell lie for the consumer gradually become serious.
9.0	Therefore, we need persue the realist in the advertisement when we make advertisements since the trust is the most important thing.
1.0	To sum up, I agree with the following standpoint that most advertisements make goods seem better than the realist because the development of medio technology and star effect.
1.0	Above all, we should make the more realistic advertisements.
3.0	In recent decades, increasing number of people like to travel in thier vocation.
3.0	Some people believe that they can take more adventage from traveling abroad.
12.0	However, their opponnents hold total different idea.
12.0	From my perspective, I support the fronter.
5.0	Above all, travelling abroad is a unique experience to learn different cultural and costumers.
8.0	When we traveling abroad, we can meet a lof of local dwelllers, who might be willing to shareu considerable sophititated insights of their countrid.
8.0	For instance, when I were traveling in Disney theme park of Orlando, I met an American couple.
8.0	when we waitting in line, they told me a lot of thing of American.
8.0	They came from Alabama.
8.0	They told me what they like doing in thankgivin,watching Iron bowl, a foodball game between University of Alabama and Auburn university in every thanks giving holiday.
8.0	After that, they prepared the thanksgiving dinner of all family mumber.
8.0	So during this convesation, I got to know how American people celebrete their holiday which is hard to  know from my textbok.
5.0	In addion, travelling abroad is beneficial to learn a lot of language skill.
8.0	When you try to learn a language, the best way is go to that country and talk with native speaker, by which you can learn a lot of skil from them and know the utilize the language.
8.0	"For example, in my english testbook, when people are meeting, they may say ""how are you"". and when I travel in American, I found no one use it."
8.0	"Most people just used ""how' s going""."
8.0	In this trip, I had some many opportunity to practice my English.
8.0	And when I back to my counrty, I found my English improving a lot.
2.0	To sum up, I should say that traveling abroad.
11.0	Having a good leadership is important for being a leader.
11.0	A good leader can lead the team go further, but how to become a good leader is a controversial question.
12.0	Some would say it comes naturally when one was born.
11.0	In contrary, I would like to say leadership can be separated by different areas.
11.0	Such as: popularity and professional ability.
11.0	And my opinion is these can be learn by different ways.
5.0	To start with, I believe popularity can be developed well.
8.0	popularity is a important factor that determines if a person have leadership or not.
8.0	A popular person always have a lot of friends and people prefer to listen to one's word if he or she is popular.
8.0	I think any unpopular person can be popular if they want.
8.0	For instance, my friend Mike told me his own experience.
8.0	He said once he compaigned the position of moniter and he was supported by almost everyone in class.
8.0	I was very curious so I asked why.
8.0	He explained that he used to be a shy boy so that he didn't talk much in class.
8.0	The result was nobody wanted to make friends with him.
8.0	One day he started to talk with everybody in his class and always helped other people with study.
8.0	Then he became very popular among students.
8.0	That's the most important reason why he got everybody's support in election of monitor.
5.0	Furthermore, I think professional ability can also be trained as well.
8.0	A leader should be have better ability in specific field.
8.0	Some people born with high IQ, but most of people are just normal.
8.0	So what people should do to have good leadership is working hard to know more specific knowledge.
8.0	Here is an example of myself.
8.0	It happened when I studied in high school.
8.0	Our school set up a math group and I was fortunately selected even if I didn't do well in matt.
8.0	By the way, most of the teammates were doing better than I was.
8.0	I almost wanted to give up.
8.0	However, my parents encouraged me and told me to insist on it.
8.0	Then I studied math like crazy.
8.0	I spend three hours everyday to do math problems.
8.0	And the result was I got the highest score on my math final exam.
8.0	Consequently, I became the leader of our math group.
0.0	Although I have to say somebody born with great leadership because they were the most popular kids in school when they were young.
0.0	Even if they took a heavy responsibility when they worked.
0.0	I still have to say that leadership can be improved by different ways.
0.0	People can also gain a great leadership by improving their popularity and professional ability.
3.0	Whatever we are in the university or society, we undoubtely have our own communities such as a club or a team.
12.0	Obviously power from every members in the communities is the cornerstone for the development of the communities.
12.0	Nevertheless, having a gimpse into this society, young people almost have no time to provide contribution to their communities owing to myriad factors.
4.0	In the first place, to face the increasing pressure from the society, young people in the university choose to dedicate all of their time to equip them the ability to make them established in the society.
8.0	For instance, as the advance of the international periad, almost all the big companies need their employees to obtain the secondery languaging ability, which can allow their employees to cooperate with more foreign companies.
8.0	This way, whatever your major in the university, to study secondery langugy is neccassry for each young people.
8.0	Therefore, young people are supposed to dedicate more time on language study addition to finishing their major work.
8.0	This way it is very hard for young people to find time to attend their club and develop their club.
4.0	In the second place, it is a generally accepted fact that yong people noaways have more massive loard from family; therefore, they have no enough time to contribute to their communities.
8.0	Sending children to study abroad, afford high family budget including the recreation consuption and living cost become essential ingredient part of the young people's life.
8.0	Therefore, the common phenomenon for young people is that they always hard work all the time in order to climb upper and get more money; furthermore, when they have some free time, young people prefer fing a myriad part time job instead to contribute to their communities.
8.0	Thus, young people noadays have not enough time to helping their communities as a result of fact that they face increadable pressure from family.
4.0	In the third place, owing to the unmature cognition, young people prefre relaxing themself when they have free time rather than helping their communities.
8.0	My own experience can successifully illustrate this opinion.
8.0	I am the member of the chemical club in my university.
8.0	However, When I have time, I prefer playing basketball with my friends rather than to do some publication for my communities because playing basketball ennable me to release the pressure and escape from the daily grind.
8.0	Therefore, because of the lake of responsibility, I always choose to do something I want to do rather than to spend my time to contribute to my community.
7.0	To sum up, I agree with the point that young people noadays have not enough time to helping their communities because of myriad fa
3.0	I absolutely disagree with the following statement that the ability to relate well to people is more important than studying hard in school.
11.0	The is also a controversial issue in educational field.
11.0	To support my idea, the persuasive reasons and details would be provided in following paragraphs.
4.0	Firstly, although many people think that the ability to relate well to people is important, in my opinion, studying hard in school is better to being successful in future jod.
9.0	For example, if you can get on well with everyone at work, but you have a lack of academic knowledge and skills, how can you become successful?
9.0	The improvement and progress in study are mostly rely on hard work instead of good relationship between workmates.
4.0	Moreover, I think that sometimes having the ability to relate well to people is a kind of time-wasting.
8.0	As far as we know, many workmates are likely to have meals, hang out with each other for a long time as long as they are free.
8.0	Also, they would discuss the issues, plans which they have met during worktime.
8.0	It seems like they have good relationship between each other.
8.0	However, they might talk about something unrelated to the formal work or academic subjects.
8.0	Why don't they spend this time on studying and improving academic skills?
8.0	Although relaxion is necessary, it could't easily make you become successful in your future job.
4.0	Also, if people relate well to each other, they might ask others for help as long as they met some problems, this would improve their dependence, and cause them to have a lack of confidence to solve problems by themselves.
10.0	They should develop their skills to solve problems independently.
2.0	To conclude, I think studying hard in school is more crucial than the ability to relate well to people, which contradicts to the statement.
11.0	I don't think it's a good idea .
12.0	I think parents should not give money to their children for good grade because it can make children become money minded.
11.0	They well think that they do everything is for money.
11.0	The only reason why they study is that they can get money.
9.0	Money can do everything they want,so they won't study if their parents doesn't provide money anymore.
9.0	the result of this may force them become the slavers of the money,they will do everything to get money even killing people.
5.0	Another reason is that children is aware of money and how to use money,so  they may develop ahabit of using money temperately.
8.0	After they married,they will blame that why their parents didn't teach they how to save money.
8.0	This may cause marrige problem if they are newly married and not so rich.
8.0	So please develop your children a habit of using money temperately.
5.0	Also,study is their own thing.
8.0	They should study for themselves but not for other reasons like money.
8.0	Get good education is also for themselves.
8.0	So if they think study is to get money,they will become overwhelming on money.
8.0	They will never know that money needs to be earn,they just think good grade can gains money.
1.0	In conclusion,parents should not give your children money, it will onlt olet them become cruel and social,it is not good for their mind at that age.
1.0	And they will become jealous on money ,they do everything toget money ,so that makes them can't go on well with others.
7.0	It's
7.0	just my personal opinion ,it's not true or false of what you thin
3.0	In these days, there are many different way to get a good job.
10.0	Some people may think we don't need to study hard in school, and the social relationship is more important than a good grade.
3.0	Is that true?
3.0	Do we not need to study hard when we were a student?
11.0	I completely agree with that.
12.0	And there are some reasons,
5.0	First, A success in a job or getting a good job need too much professional knowledges.
8.0	These cannot easily get from other people.
8.0	That doesn't mean that others don't want to tell you, because not everyone is a good teacher.
8.0	Then you have to pay much more time in some professional books.
8.0	As you know, Steven Jobs, who establish iPhone company, even he is not finish his college, he still stay in college and participate in different courses.
8.0	Then, as he said, it become useful when he create the first production.
5.0	Second, a good relationship with others may help promot in your job, but that is a luck depended way.
8.0	Once the enviroment of people change.
8.0	You will be harder or restart.
8.0	But studying hard can give you many possible.
8.0	When the chance comes you have enough ability to grasp it easilly.
10.0	Maybe, the good relationship will give you a
3.0	In the era of information, Internet seems to be a dispensable part of people's life, it shortens the distance between people all around the world by providing large amount of information.
3.0	Therefore, this enormous change brings to the society an interesting dispute: some people claim that much information creats problems while others hold opposite opinions.
12.0	As far as I am concerned, I agree that people can have access to valuable information from Internet, which will benefit us a lot in the long run.
4.0	By searching information available on the Internet, we can obtain large quantities of useful skills, which is beneficial to us.
8.0	For example, students who are preparing for IELTS or TOELF, information on the Internet is a treasure for them to explore.
8.0	They can gain whatever they are in desperate need for their preparation, such as vocabulary and grammar, which they can accumulate for writting.
8.0	Besides, they can also get vital suggestions shared by other students who have already passed the exams.
8.0	Therefore, they are able to develop their language skills and achieve their dreams of studying abroad.
4.0	Another important aspect is the current affairs.
8.0	Internet offers us an opportunity to be aware of the occurrence of many great events all over the world.
8.0	For example, we can witness the military parade to mark the 70th anniversary of victory in the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression due to the Internet.
8.0	Recently, a dead Syrian child on the beach draw the whole worlds attention, it is the Internet from which we can get information about outside world, this terrible issue then spark the world into action and urge people to pay attention to the refugees.
8.0	We can not only be informed of the joyful events but also those horrible news related to our lives through the Internet.
4.0	Admittedly, there are some unreal information on the Internet such as the misleading advertisements, rumour about celebrities and false news.
9.0	But I don't consider it as a trouble, fake information can be under control if people are critical thinkers and have the ability to tell the truth.
9.0	The rumor stops when it comes to a wise person after all.
1.0	All in all, the Internet is a great tool for us to be surrounded by a large amount of information, which can broden our horizon and make us knowledgeable instead of being into trouble.
1.0	Besides, it is the person who spreads unreal information rather than the Internet should be blamed.
3.0	Recently, there is a heated discussion about the protect of wild animals and wilderness areas for future .
11.0	Some people believe that the protection is important ,However, other people think that it not important to protect.
11.0	In my opinion, I thinks we should choose the first one.
5.0	First, the wilderness area and wild animals are good for the ecosystem.
8.0	Since the nature need the balance, and the number of wild anmials should be stable, if the wild animals and wilderness area are weel protected, it benefit the ecosystem.
8.0	And a good ecosystem will benefit the earth and the future generation.
8.0	Because the future generation need a stable environment, it will makes them to live happily and without much problem.
5.0	Second, the wilderness area will be a good place to play for citizen.
8.0	People could play in the wilderness.
8.0	Because some children like some outdoor activities, and the wilderness place will be great area for them to do some outdoor activities, which will make them happy, as a result,it is better for their growth.
8.0	That is why it is important to protect the wilderness area.
8.0	Children , the future generation could gain joy from the wilerness areas.
2.0	In conclusion, it is really important for government to protect wild animals and wilderness areas for future generation.
12.0	i agree this statement .
12.0	parents should let children make mistake and let them learn from their own mistakes .
8.0	Because i think ,every one have make mistake , only make mistake i  can learn some things about .
8.0	For example , one day , i study in the primary school , teacher give us some homework about english homework ,.
8.0	At home , i do the english homework ,then i finish the english homework .
8.0	In the school ,i give teacher my homework , teacher find many mistake in my homework then ask me how to do ,and tell me about what the words means ,so after i see these question i can to do .
8.0	In the other hands .
8.0	if i do not how to cook  cake , maybe i can to try some ways to do the cakes,maybe i can do some ways to do cake finally i  can success  so if i  want success shoukd  make some mistake .
8.0	So i try some ways i know the cake to do should into what things in the cake can make a cake .
8.0	so i know need egg and milk and some water you can make a cake .
8.0	So make mistake not a bad thing ,and should to overcome difficult .
8.0	when i a child i want to write but i do not  to write so my mother teache
12.0	I agree with the statement that collges should raise professors' income on the purpose of enhancing the teaching quality of the school.
6.0	First of all, higher income could provide school faculties with a less living pressure,which in turn spare them more energy on their jobs.
8.0	College teachers deserve high salaries and many of them actually need money just like everyone else does,considering the high cost of living today---children' education fee,car,daily family budget,and housing especially.
8.0	Professors may stress out with making a living sometimes under such heavy burdens.
8.0	How do we expect that  they come to the stage and give what they have learned for decades to the students with full energy?
8.0	However,with higher income,things would be in a different way.
7.0	Moreover,raise salary as extra rewards  would be a great incentive for teachers to pursue a better education quality
12.0	As far as I am concered, parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.
11.0	Mistakes   are  a lifelong companion that cannot be avoided.
12.0	Parents are not able to help children to face the problems all their life.
12.0	Letting children how to deal with mistakes is of great significance.
10.0	And they will learn a lot through the process.
5.0	In my opinion, when children have made mistakes and they have dealt with them by themselves, they will be more deeply impressed by the standards of the things that they must or must not do.
9.0	For example, when students are caught in cheating, they will punished by their teachers.
9.0	However, if parents requir the teacher for forgiveness, the children will think the cheating as something with no importance.
5.0	Futhermore, I think when children learn from their own mistakes, they will master more skills and thus strength their confidence, which will benefit their independent ability.
8.0	For instance, when you make mistakes and no one can help you, then, you will try everthing you can to solve the mistakes.
8.0	In the process, you may learn many methods, skills and ideas which you will not master for ever if there are someone helps you.
8.0	The learned knowledges will greatly provied you a feeling of confidence and the process of learning will make you become more independent, which are valuable feagures in sociaty.
2.0	All in all, I think parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from the mistakes.
11.0	Nowadays, due to the rapid development of society, the issue of whether people should follow the rules that societies today hope the young to follow has become an increasingly controvecial topic.
12.0	Some believe the rules are too strict to follow, while others believe they should follow.
11.0	Although I have some doubt, I tend to agree with the latter, and I will articulate my view below.
4.0	Firstly, the strict rules can help humans to tell right and wrong.
8.0	The reason why people should follow the rules is that the contends in the rule are those individuals consider as something awful, so they put them into the rules.
8.0	If persons follow the rules and don't break it, they will be the person who develop roundly.
8.0	To illustrate, reacently a sociologist did a rearch
4.0	Besides, it is the freedom that the rules can bring to individuals.
4.0	Finally, although the it is uncomfotable for peole to follow the rules, the rules can protect them.
8.0	In fact, all of rules are built up to preserve the profit of most of people.
8.0	And if someone break the rules, they will do something harmful to the profit.
8.0	For example, all of people should follow the law of their country.
8.0	And the law is to protect citizens.
7.0	However, if someone want to get more profit which will be harmful in others' profit, they will be punished
3.0	Public transportation has always been a major issue that government would take into consideration.
3.0	On the other hand, with the remarkable development of human society, Internet access seems to be much more important than ever before.
3.0	Therefore, some people initiate the debate about whether government should put more money on the improvement of Internet access or public transportation.
12.0	From my perspective, Internet access is more important.
4.0	First and foremost, Internet access can promote education fairness between rural areas and cities.
8.0	Acting like a window, Internet can help people from rural areas know more about urban lives as well as the most advanced technologies, which they might not easily experience without living in cities in person.
8.0	If teenage and youth has access to Internet, they will have chances to learn something online.
8.0	For example, there is a remote village in China, where most kids wouldn't receive further education.
8.0	But since there installed computer and Internet devices, they have had opportunity to watch video recorded by the most brilliant teachers from huge cities.
8.0	To a certain degree, they have virtually the same high quality education as the kids in the city do.
4.0	Besides, Internet access can boost the development of an area.
8.0	It is widely acknowledged that Internet can increase the efficiency of work.
8.0	The more efficient people work, the higher value they are able to create.
8.0	And this would lead to the boom of an area.
8.0	For example, my hometown, where Internet access was seldom found, used to be quite small and not developed.
8.0	However, after government spend money promosting the Internet access, there appeared a great amount of companies, which is conducive to the development.
8.0	So it has already been a competitive city with much more population.
4.0	Admittedly, public trasportation do funtion a lot in making people's life more handy.
9.0	But Internet access is something that goverment should be more concerned about.
9.0	According to Chinese acedamy, the proportion of people who have access to Internet is still frustrating.
2.0	To put it into a nutshell, government should spend more money incresing Internet access considering the above-mentioned benefits.
3.0	Recently an interesting question has aroused the attention among people: should children be given more time to do whatever they want?
3.0	some people say that they should spend more time on doing homework or participating in organized activities related to school or sports.
11.0	While I believe that give children more spare time to do what they want is beneficial for their development in the future.
5.0	To begin with, having some more time on what children like can cultivate specific interest in their life to hold on to.
8.0	Nowadays a lot of young students have no idea about what they like and what they want to do in the future.
8.0	Due to heavy work and organized activities all the day, they start to lose their curiosity for everything.
8.0	To give them a goal to make efforts to, parents and teachers have to allow them to have more time on their own willings.
8.0	Take my little cousin for example.
8.0	When he were 8 years old, my aunt send him to 5 professional learning classes out of school.
8.0	He just stressed out everyday in that period of time.
8.0	As a result, his grade began to fall after learning in too many classes because he lost his dream for acting.
8.0	The organized activities forced him to give up his interest and lost his energy.
5.0	Secondly, giving more time to children can make them  have better arrangement of time and become more independent.
8.0	Children in modern society are used to relying on their arranged schdule and the ability of arranging time validly themselves is becoming worse and worse.
8.0	They need to have an opportunity  to practise being independent.
8.0	My roommate Olive is a very independent guy.
8.0	He said that it's because when he were in elementary school, his mother didn't send him to classes out of school.
8.0	So he spent a lot of time reading and hanging out with friends.
8.0	That makes him very outgoing and always know what to do to make the time worthwhile.
8.0	I believe he will be successful in the future with his dream coming true.
1.0	To put it into nutshell, I strongly support that children should be given more time on what they would like to do.
1.0	That would be a great promotion to their success in their lives.
3.0	Nowadays, there are more and more advertisements occur in the market.
3.0	The perpose of the ad is to appeal the consumer let them buy these things.
11.0	So for this statement that ad vertisement make products seem much better than thay really are, I agree with it.
12.0	ad could let people pay more attention on the productions, could give the consumer a sence of satisfaction.
5.0	However, someting which with very nice appearence and in the ad it is very useful.
8.0	But actually it does not have a good quality.
8.0	It is a very common phenomenone.
8.0	And next time the consumer will not buy this product.
8.0	But on the other word if the product have the good quality, ot is very necessary to take the ad for this product.
8.0	That is because, consumer get the information of the product firstly is from the ad.
8.0	The better the ad made the more attention the consumer will pay to the product.
8.0	The ad could let the consumer to feel they actually like this product.
5.0	The beautiful ad could bring the satisfaction to the consumer, when they see this ad they wlil be amazing and have a good first impression to the product.
8.0	For instance, KOBE is the best super star in the world.
8.0	He participate into a lot of ad just like the shoes of the NIKE compeny.
8.0	Amount of people who like play basketball will buy these shoes because the see KOBE wear these shoes is very cool.
8.0	And the ad give the consumer a feeling of active.
8.0	They really want to wear these shoes paly basktball like KOBE.
8.0	Even though this shoes is very expensive but they still will buy these.
8.0	The ad make it better than  before.
7.0	All in all, the ad also take other benefits to the product, so i think to make a ad is very necessary an
12.0	I don't think it's a good idea.
8.0	Althogh it can encorage children to do better on the test, but money is not the most important thing.
8.0	I think it will teach the children to think too much about money,and that's not good.
8.0	The children are studying for themselves, not for money.
8.0	I think it will make the children to think everything they do is for money, and that is very bad for their future life.
8.0	But I'm not saying that encoraging children is bad, just do it in another way.
8.0	Going out with them is okay,seeing a film, going to a concert and etc.
8.0	But don't buy presents or give them money.
8.0	Other things are all okay,why money?
3.0	State finacial expenditure is always an big issue for citizens to talk about.
11.0	Some people may think governments should spend more money in support of the arts than in support of athletics such as state-sponsored Olympic teams while I believe that more money should be put into athletics rather than arts.
11.0	In my opinion, there are three main reasons such as athletics activities can stimulate people's national honor, athletics training costs more money, and the athletes can earn the bonus for their countries.
4.0	First of all, spending more money on athletics can stimulate civil national honor.
8.0	With plenty of money spent on, athletes can get adequate elements to win the sport contests.
8.0	After they stand on the podium, their names and countries will be known by people from all over the world.
8.0	Additionally, the national flag and the national song of the winner country will also be shown to the whole world.
8.0	This is such an honor that will rise the citizens' national pride for sure.
4.0	Secondly, athletic training need more money than arts activities objectively.
8.0	Hiring top-level trainers, buying suitable training fields and hiring famous doctors and other workers for the athletes will cost a barrel of money every year.
8.0	However,it is the only way to win the important international athletic competition like the Olympic game.
8.0	The fewer money the government spend, the less chance for the athletes to win.
4.0	Thirdly, athletes can get a big bonus for the government.
8.0	Whatever how much the government spend on sports, the final goal is to win the fierce competition.
8.0	And after the sporters win, they will get more bonus back for the government.
8.0	What the government spent before
2.0	All in all, I think athletics is more worthy for governments to spend more money on.
3.0	Nowadays, teachers always play a vital role in students' development.
11.0	Some people hold the idea that teachers should not tell students their own social or political views, while others may think it will be good to share opinions in these aspects.
11.0	As far as I can see, I prefer the later attitude.
11.0	The reason are as following.
5.0	First, teachers can help students become more comprehensive by talking about social and political issues.
8.0	In recent years, students use more and more time to focus on their study, so there are little time to learn about social skills and political events.
8.0	If teachers could share their views and tips with students, they could not only know more about society and politics but also the social skills and the right attitude towards politics.
8.0	When I was in high school, my history teacher like sharing his experience and social views with us.
8.0	It was really interesting and beneficial because when I attend university, I found everyone needs to face the situations he told us, like how to reject others and so on.
5.0	Second, it is a good method for teachers to arise students' interest.
8.0	It is obvious that if teachers talk about the professional content all the time, students will be distracted and feel boring.
8.0	Therefore, sharing views in other aspects is a good way to relax themselves and students.
8.0	Take my own experience for example, I acted as a tutor to a 16-year-old boy last summer.
8.0	When I focused on the course's content, it was difficult for him to be concentrated for a long time.
8.0	Therefore, I talk about some social events and political views with him and he was interested in these topics.
8.0	After talking about that for a while, he could work more effectively.
2.0	Actually, I could understand that some people think teachers should not make their views about society and politics known to students, because they may not hold the right attitude and it will distracts students' attention.
7.0	However, students also need a time to relax themselves and it is a good choice to talk about that baecause
7.0	it is be
3.0	There is no denying that nearly every government puts more and more value on education than ever before, since a nation's development depends on soft power, especially higer education, to a considerable degree.
12.0	For the sake of enhancing the quality of education, universities tend to increase professor's salaries, for the reason that with affluent income professors would be undoubtedly more devoted to their work, thus improving the whole education naturally.
11.0	On the contray, I firmly believe that it can hardly be regarded as a wise decision to increase the budget for salaries of faculties.
4.0	First and foremost, it is highly likely that this implement would exert the burden on students who have already been overwhelmed by high tuitions.
8.0	With a tight budget for nearly every university in our nation, enhancement of professor's salaries is probably supposed to come from tuitions, which have been increasing straightly for over ten years.
8.0	A large number of students are complaining about this issue and unfortunately the majority of them are obliged to loan from the bank or work in part-time employment in order to make the ends meet.
8.0	Consequently, the top priority of students, study, has been interfered by their worries to pay for the loans and their endless part-time jobs.
4.0	Apart from that, even if salaries of university professors are upgraded, it does not necessarily mean that they will be more committed to teaching.
8.0	Faced with huge pressure of research and publishing, there is every prospect that professors would be dedicated to their research projects and climbing the academic ladder.
8.0	Sadly, fewer professors give their priority to educate students, which should have been the crucial part of this vocation.
8.0	Besides, lots of other temptations have restricted professor's concentration on instruction.
8.0	For instance, they have to purchase apartments to ameliorate the living standards for their own families.
4.0	Finally, the best approach to reach a better education environment is to invest in university facilies, rather than salaries.
8.0	That is because most universities in our province, for example, suffer from out-of-date facilies, including those for experiments, dormitories, and libraries.
8.0	When I was a freshman, it was stunning to find that there was no hot water machine in my dormitory, resulting in that I had to carry hot water to take a shower from another building 200 metres away from my room.
8.0	Especially in harsh winter, I sincerely wished that we could enjoy hot water to warm our bodies just in our rooms.
8.0	This obstacle for the safety and well-being should be removed immediately.
2.0	In conclusion, rather than raising salaries of professors, universities should put more value on facilities to increase the level of education.
12.0	Many parents give money to their school-age children for every high grade they get in school, I think that these peoson may want to let their children to have a childhood just like themself, but they may not take the development of world into account, there is variety of difference between them and their offspring.
12.0	I will state my opinion in detail.
7.0	As far as i am concerned, students who are in primary school or senior school are more likely to abuse their money, they can not control themselves in many situation such as when they find something they want in supermarket, they may buy many thing without thinking, which will let them can not make contrebutions to their study,and instand, they amy abandon themselves in entertainment,
3.0	Is it polite of you as a underling to interrupt the meeting for some fault of the leadership?
3.0	Are all of your opinions true affirmatively?
11.0	As a elite in our companies, I must not interrupt the speech of anyone in our companies for any reason in the meeting.
11.0	From my perspective, the interruption is uncourteous, and we need to hear other people's opinion humbly, so I will correct them until the meeting is over and the people are gone.
6.0	On the one hand, we should respect anyone in the formal occasion for the courtesy.
8.0	To be more convincible.
8.0	In our country, there are the customs that telling us the significance of esteem: you do not interrupt the speech of the speakers since this behavior not only will influence the discipline but also might cut in on the speakers' idea, even you might be hated by your leadership, then you gain the dismissal.
8.0	And on the other words, just thinking a environment that no one respects each other, the team will become  chaotic.
8.0	Meanwhile, on one says that you could not correct the mistake for the speakers while the class or the meeting over.
8.0	Obviously, correct the mistake until the meeting over and the people are gone is the best choice.
2.0	On the other hand, you point of view is not necessarily the right point of view.
10.0	To be more specific, since each person's view of things is not the same, focus on one thing, we always have several angles.
7.0	So the best choice for us is to listen for other one's idea humbly and derive their different ideas, it is not only can boarden up our horizon but also can enrich our l
12.0	There are many things to consider when confronted with a situation where others' opinions are incorrect from your perspective.
11.0	Different people have differing ideas about what to do.
11.0	Some may think they should interupt and correct what they think is wrong right away to avoid further spreading of the mistakes.
12.0	Others may say nothing for their fear of offending the leader.
12.0	As far as I am concerned, both of the ways above are inappropriate.
9.0	We should wait until the class or meeting is over and people are gone,and then talk to the teacher or the meeting leader about the mistake.
9.0	This way, we could not only avoid offending learders in public but also make our own opinion known to them.
5.0	First, I believe it will be awkward for anyone to be interrupted and blamed for a mistake in public, especially for those who are accustomed to respect from subordinates, such as teachers and leaders.
8.0	If you interrupt and state your opinion right away, even if your opinion is right, you will possibly leave a bad impression on the teacher if the teacher is narrow-minded.
8.0	In another case, if your opinion is incorrect,  you not only will offend the teacher or leader, but also waste the public time, which is considered as a poor behavior.
8.0	In a nut shell, this kind of behavior is not a wise choice to take.
5.0	For another choice, saying nothing is also not a reasonable choice.
8.0	In this way, you can indeed avoid offending the lears but you also lose the chance of impressing them with your innovative viewpoints.
8.0	With the time going by, you are likely to lose the desire and ability to raise doubts on others and that is the emblem of average people.
8.0	These phenomenon is common in college, isn't it?
8.0	Many college students think if they offend the professors, they will get a low score in return and they finally don't raise questions, and that is what innovation requires.
0.0	So, we can't offend the leaders in public and we can neither say nothing, then what shall we do?
0.0	Waiting until the class or meeting is over and the people are gone and then talking to the teacher or the leader about your opinions is the right thing to do.
0.0	For there aren't people around, you don't need to worry you will make the teacher embarrased.
0.0	On top of that, you do seize the chance to impress the teachers or leaders with your unique opinion and that is what we call 'Kill two birds with one stone.'
3.0	Some people says that students are more influenced by their teachers than their friends, but I can not agree with them.
3.0	When it comes to the statment that students are more influenced by their friends than their teachers, I strongly agree.
3.0	I agree with this statment for two reasons, students stay togeter with their friends more often than they do with their  teachers,and there is a big gap between the students and their teachers.
5.0	Firstly, the students stay longer with their friends than with teachers, which means that they know a lot about their friends and know less about their teachers.
9.0	As a reasult, they are more influenced by their friends.
9.0	For example, I live in my school with my friends, so I know a lot about them, and I have been influenced by them a lot, but I know little about my teachers, so I have been influenced more by my friends than my teachers.
5.0	Secondly, there is a big gap between the students and their teachers, so they will not be able to influence the students much.
8.0	"As the old Chinese saying says ""three years, one gap."""
8.0	So you can see how big the gap is between me and my teachers.
8.0	For example, at my school, my head teacher is crazy about movies, he says he has seen more than one thousand films.
8.0	However, the movies he likes are very different from the movies we like, and he hates Marvel, Disney or Hollywood, which is basicly what we like, and we cannot understand him.
8.0	So how can a person so different from us influence us even more than our closest friends?
2.0	For these two reasons, students stay togeter with their friends more often than they do with their  teachers,and there is a big gap between the students and their teachers, I agree with the statement that students are more influenced by their friends than their teachers.
3.0	Nowadays,the discussion about how to realx is beteer gets more and more popular.
3.0	Some people think watching a movie or reading a book is better than doing physical exercise.
3.0	Others hold the oppsite opnion.
11.0	They think dong physical exercise is a better choice.
12.0	From my perspective,i think there is no contradiction beween watching a movie or reading a book and doing physical exercise.
8.0	Both of them are good ways for relaxing.
8.0	And it's hard to say which one is better.
8.0	They have different advantages.
5.0	Watching a movie or reading a book is more easy to do when you are physical tired.
8.0	If you are exhausted ,You will not have enery to go outside and do some exercise.
8.0	Drinking a cup of tea and reading a book is more realxing for you.
8.0	Take myself as an example,my hometown is far from my university,It takes me 7 hours go back to home.
8.0	It's really a hard time on the trian.
8.0	So everytime i arrive home,i fell extremely tired.
8.0	And i never want to doing some exrcise,though my friends always invite me to play football.
8.0	What i want to do is lying on the sofa and watch some interesting movie.
5.0	But sometimes,its your brain not your body gets tired.
8.0	And you will do not want receive more information to your head.
8.0	In this situation,it's better to do some exercise than reaidng a book.
8.0	For instance,when i have trouble in my acadmic work,i will go to the palyground to paly football for one hour or just runing.
8.0	It can clear my brian.
8.0	And when i go back to study,i may can solve the problem very soon because my brain has a good rest.
0.0	Watching a moive or reading a book and doing exercise can relieve people's stress.
0.0	However,they also can cause some bad effect if we can not control ourselves well.
0.0	Some people may can not stop watching movies or reading books when thay are addicted to it.
0.0	Some movies and books are really interesting.
10.0	"For example,when i was in high school,i was addicted to the movie""harry potter""."
7.0	It has
3.0	In recent decades, finding a decent job play a significant role for studnets and their parents.
3.0	With the tution fee tremendous inceasing and employ difficulty for most college students, some people belive that relating well with poeple is more vital factor to find a job than study hard in school.
11.0	However, from my perspective, I still think that studying hard in school is still important.
6.0	No one can deny that school studing give a lot background information of future job for students.
8.0	School have the comprehensive curriculum for students' future career, which is make by many experts with sophisticated insights and abundant experience.
8.0	For instance, as an information system management student, I have considerable subjects that I can utilize in my future.
8.0	For instance, the account help me make a budget for building imformation system.
8.0	And the programming class taught me how to use the a computing sentance to achieve one function in the system.
8.0	The database class help me familiar with the skill how to mine, storage   and clean the unorganized datas.
8.0	In this case, it was obvious that the school learning provide a basestone for future job.
2.0	In addition, the school can help student get the certification for future job.
8.0	Many jobs need the relative certification.
8.0	For instance, if you want to get a accountants jobs.
8.0	You may need a accounting bar.
8.0	If you want to be a layer, a layer bar can make you competitive than your peer.
8.0	The school is good place to learn how to get the certification.
7.0	There are so many professor who
3.0	Nowadays some parents offer their school-age children money for each high mark they get in school,which is obviously a bad idea.
11.0	According to me, this will do little help to the kid's grades, and will even have a potential risk on their education.
5.0	Kid's grades only get higher when they study harder.
9.0	Meantime, it is plain that studying becomes more difficult as children's grades rise, and children's need for pocket money goes up as they become older.
9.0	If a child is studying hard for money, it is easy to find out that his price will go up, so this is plainly not a idea for long.
5.0	Why do children study hard?
8.0	They may be studying hard for their interests, their goals or their dreams.
8.0	And all these motivations take time for children to discover and develop by themselves.
8.0	Sadly, parents' money undoutfully has some negative influence during the process.
8.0	The influence may be deep or not, but it surely traps children from discovering their own very reasons to study hard.
8.0	And when time goes by, the children may turn into some people who do not know what to work hard for, thus becoming lasy, aimless daydreamers.
2.0	Any way, parent's money will do no good to their children's study, which should originally be their dreams or interests that can really cheer them up and make a difference.
3.0	How many time you spend in studying everyday?
3.0	Do you like to do some other funny things like playing onlion, chtting with friends and so on?
11.0	From my perspective, I really agree with the statement that educating in nowadays is much more difficult than before because of some new inventions.
5.0	Because children feel really enjoyable when they spend time on cell phone, online games and social networkig Web site, they are not willing to study which is really boring and difficult.
8.0	Mayun, a Chinese businessman, is a typical instance to support my point of view.
8.0	During his educating year, technological smart phone start to show up which is a really innovative electronic device and he find that it is really interesting when playing it.
8.0	At moment, something is going to change between today's children and those in the past.
8.0	Children in nowadays are addicted to using smart ohones which is not invented until today, but not willing to spend time in study, including solving hard questions, reciting long articals, dictating difficult words and etc.
8.0	On the contrary, no these new inventions will occupy past children's live; thus, what they like to do is only working hard and sometimes play in the park with their neiborhood children.
8.0	It is not difficult for them to study because no internal interruptions will affect them.
5.0	Although some people thinks that children can learn more from those platform, it is actually become more difficult because less chidren can control themselves well.
8.0	Take my self, a high school student, as an example to illustrate my perspective.
8.0	My teacher always ask our class to search some effective information online and hand in our homework by sending the e-mail.
8.0	I follow my teachers steps but after I finish those steps, I begin to play online and even chat with my friend for a extrem long time.
8.0	Online can really help us but also do harm to us and because we are young, we will find that it is difficult to control ourselves not tp paly online.
8.0	From my owen story, we can know that because of the appearance of cell phone , computer and the lack of self-control, we will be easy to spend too much in playing rather than studying  without any expectation.
1.0	In summary, educating becomes more and more difficult because og those new inventions and we wil be hard to control ourself after study online.
1.0	Therefore, the statement is really correct from my point of view.
11.0	Now a days more and more parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school, someone may think it ok, but in my opinion I don't think is a good idea.
4.0	Offer children money when they get good grade may ruin their valves.
9.0	If kids get a good mark in the school, what need parents mostly need to do is to prise them by some encourging words, to let them kown they did a great job on the study rather than just offer some money.
9.0	If parents offer the money, the kids may think that in the real life money is everything, so ganna have some bad influnce on the valve of kids.
4.0	Offer children money when get high mark in school may let them very hard to mantain the high score.
8.0	Because when they get that money , they may spend all the money overnight, for they are kids and don't have much self-control.
8.0	And they will soon forget the money encourgement because they spend money very fast.
8.0	In the kids education, the encourgement is truly important.
8.0	When kid lose that , it's hard to study well.
4.0	Offer children some money will make they think that money is easy to make.
9.0	It true that parents love them kids very much s' so they always offer kids a lots of money, which is bad.
9.0	Becasue kids may think they can some money by exam whichis very easy ,but the truth is that now a days is even evry hare to find a job.
1.0	So I think it' s pretty bad idea to offer kids money when they get good mark in the exam.
1.0	the better way is to prise them in words.
12.0	As is universally acknowledged,the teaching method which rewards children when they do great jobs is popularized among children.
11.0	As far as i am concerned,it is,in most cases, a great way to stimulate person to move on.
5.0	In modern society.
8.0	competition is everywhere to be found.
8.0	So the special and effective ways to make us improve are essential.
8.0	For example,my brother used to be a bad guy before senior high school.
8.0	Their parents were worried much about him.
8.0	By accident,my father suggested them to take another way to educate the child.
8.0	Then my brother was excited after hearing that if he gets a high mark in school he will get extra money.
8.0	Unsurprisingly,he tried hard to practice test as much as he could.
8.0	He seemed as if changed a person whom i have never met.
8.0	Adimittedly,he was not that naughty child.
8.0	After the test results are announced,he gained a great mark he never had.
8.0	Thanks to this special way,his grade improved apparently.
8.0	It is the offering of money for high mark that makes this unbelievable changes happen.
8.0	I had seen it all,which made me proud of him.
5.0	In other words,we should also not take it for granted that the high grade means money.
8.0	In the life voyage,we usually gain great achivements while we are not received what we want.
8.0	It is truth which we can not deny it.
8.0	So we students should know that the method is only to push you forwards rather than just give you a money.
10.0	In a word,only if we balance the scales wil
11.0	In current society, everyone suffers from tremendous pressure and depression from work, because today life is complicated and full of challenge, Some people think it is essential for young people to have an ability to plan and organize.
11.0	However, their opponents insist that there are some other quality more important for youths.
12.0	I aggree first idea.
5.0	Above all, the abillty to make measurable and feaible plan plays significant role on today society.
8.0	Because of the today assignment is complicated and systemic, if we do not make a deliverable plan, we may make tremendous mistake.
8.0	And our mistakes may cause delay for whole project.
8.0	By contrast, if we have a good plan and well organize, our work will be more efficients.
8.0	For instance, last semester, I took a courses named IT projec management.
8.0	There was a final group project which include all concepts in the textbook.
8.0	At first, first week, the professor suggested us to take one week to set a plan and  separate the project to some independent part.
8.0	Our group follow his suggestion.
8.0	We make a goood plan and make sure everyone take a part of project, And we have clear deadline for the work.
8.0	After this week, we just should follow our well-organized plan.
8.0	In the end, we got excellent performment in the project paper.
8.0	However, some groups that didn't follow the advice confront a lot of procastination and the misunderstanding.
8.0	In this sense, the well plan is important.
5.0	In addtion, we plan can foster young people self-deciplin ability.
8.0	with self-diciplin ability, the man can know what time should finish assignment and achieve it.
8.0	For instance, Steven Jobs is a good example for self-diciciplin.
8.0	He alway set a clear goal in differetntperiols.
2.0	In concltion, we should make well plan to confront the complex challenge.
12.0	In this busy and noisy world, more and more people are struggling to find a ideal way to relax after work.
12.0	Some may choose to watch a movie or read a book, for it is possible to enrich their knowledge while they are relaxing.
11.0	However, as for me, I believe physical exercise is a better way than that.
12.0	Here are my reasons.
6.0	"First please ask ourselves:"" am I tired and stiff after a whole day's sitting to work with my computer?"""
8.0	"Most answers are sure to be ""yes."""
8.0	Then why not stand up and go outside to do exercise?
8.0	Running, swimming, yoga and so on, besides helping our nerve from stressful task, they will also stimulate bodies' function to improve health.
8.0	And, on the other hand, physicla exercise can also bring you happy surprise.
8.0	For example, when you do exercise in a same location, you could meet several new friedns who have similar interest with you and then chat desultorily here and there.
8.0	In view of this, physical exercise is also a efficient way to learn to communiacate after those dull and deadly silence works.
8.0	What's more, it is likely to give you inspriation during sports.
8.0	Believe or not, some people have found their love during relaxing physical exercise!
8.0	Last but not least, my friends, what I want to tell you is that people would dig out their potential for sports by exercise.
8.0	Many athletes take part in international sports competition are not totally professinal.
8.0	Some of them just found great interest as they were doing physical execise for relax and then developed it.
8.0	So what  physical exercise can give you is not a good spirit to carry on career, but also a stage to show your brilliant ability of sports.
0.0	I tried to relax by watching a movie or reading a book.
0.0	And yes, the movie was marvellous and the book was touching.
0.0	However, because of my continuing to sit with one gesture, my neck became sore and my eyes were almost striked in the end.
8.0	It was no good to efficiently improve my next work.
8.0	As far as I am concerned, physical exercise is really a nice method to relax.
8.0	Stand up, and go outside!
8.0	Let us move!
12.0	I think it's not a good idea for parents to give thier children money depending on their grad.
12.0	Obviously, this acting may encourage their children try their best to get a good grade in school.
11.0	But I don't like this kind of encouraging becuase I think the meaning of study is not to make money.
11.0	I think learning is a process that can improve our studying skills and gainning knowledge.
11.0	If using this method, children may have some idea like study is a way of making money, which is not the true meaning of studying.
5.0	Otherwise, I believe this kind of encouragement may lead their children pay more attention on material things.
9.0	Many great people rise from poor family, Lincoln is an example.
9.0	His parent can't give him much encourage on material, but he can enjoy study itself.
5.0	Another reason that can support my opinion is that I think students should learn to get money by working with their own hands.
9.0	I think it's a good way to earn extra money by doing some works, like washing cars, sending newspapers and so on.
9.0	That's a good way to let them know how hard it's to earn every single coins.
0.0	Of course, study is the first and the most important thing for a school-age children.
0.0	But education is about everything.
0.0	Parents should not only focus on student's grade, but also their characteristic.
0.0	Encouraging students to get good grade is important, but it's more important to let them know why we should study.
10.0	So I believe it's not a good choice to offer children money for each high grade they get in school.
7.0	Encourage can even be
12.0	Now, it has a ceaseless discussion about how many things people can do it at a same time.
11.0	Some people think that just can do the few things, others think can do so many different things.
11.0	"In this background, a new statement "" People can do a lot of different things rather than do very few things very well."""
11.0	From my perspective, I don't agree this statement.
12.0	Here I have three statements to oppose this statement.
4.0	Firstly, time likes the water in the sponge.
8.0	It has a lot if you want to use it.
8.0	So at a same time, people also can do many things.
8.0	The statement just an excuse to hide the truth that they are lazy.
8.0	For example, in China a lot of students want to study abroad.
8.0	They must learn the formal class and prepare the standard testing at the same time.
8.0	But, a lost of Chinese student not only get good grades in the schoolwork, but also they have a high score about the standard testing.
8.0	Because they can do many things very well at the same time.
4.0	Secondly, it needs more steps to finish a task.
8.0	If a people don't has the ability about finishing more things at the same time, he/she will be eliminated by the society.
8.0	In fact, a very easy task, such as cooking, they need to do a lot of things in a short time.
8.0	Cleaning the ingredients for many dishes, cooking the dishes,adding the condiment and so on.
8.0	If they can't do them well at a short time, they can't be stand at the society.
4.0	Finally, if a people are just can do very few things well, they'll not want to learn how to do more things.
8.0	And the people can't be succeed if they just can do few things well.
8.0	Wei Yongkang, a very clever boy.
8.0	His grade is very fantastic, especially in physics.
8.0	When he was 13 years old, he went to the university to learn physics.
8.0	But when he was young, his parents just asked him to study, so he can't do a lot of things of taking care for himself, such as washing clothes and cooking.
8.0	When he as a graduate in the science academy of China, his poor life skills can't make him adapted to the method of researching, he just can go home.
2.0	So I disagree with the statement, because people need to learn how to do so many different things.
11.0	In my own opinion, I do think it is better to relax by watiching movies or reading books.
12.0	Becasue I'm kind of lazy person, so I've never do exercise if I don't have to.
12.0	Here's the reason why I prefer watching and reading.
4.0	First of all, nowdays with better development in technology, people are more likely using their mobile phones, even some people can not live with out their phones, and of cause, watching a movie on your mobile phones or on your ipad will be really normal and popular now.
10.0	Also there are bad effects on watching movies, it is bad for your eyes and people might be addicted to it.
4.0	Second of all, reading books are also a good activity to do, well, I think you had already saw some articles about ''reading books make you more smart'' or ''you can get a lot knowledge from the book you read.''
10.0	Ture, I do think that reading books can provide us an opportunity to earn more knowledge, also there is not only one type of book you can read, there are billion of choice you can make, so I think reading books are the best thing you can do when you feel stressful.
4.0	lastly, well i have to say that doing some excecise are good for your body health.
10.0	But most of people won't choose it because nowdays people are more likely to be lazy, such as me, i mean people they know it is good for their own but they just don't want to do it because it's going to sweated and tired after exercising.
2.0	Anyway, In my own opinion, I will choose watching movies and reading books instead of doing ecercise, becasue it is less fun and streesful to do.
3.0	In such a highly developed society, the message always spread fast and widely know.
3.0	And the information is significantly improtant when people are participated in some business.
11.0	Some people believe that they need to gain information from many different ways, so they can obtian as much information as they can.
12.0	In my oppinion, I hold the view that people should concentrate on a certern news sources which they are pursuing with.
4.0	First, gaining informations from many different ways does make some benefits.
8.0	Unfortunately, it also would make some mistakes when we get the wrong information.
8.0	My friend Joe used to work in a medical company.
8.0	Once he had purchased a type of medicine that he bought from a mechant.
8.0	The reason why he was willing to buy this product is that he was heard the price of this product would increase for a while.
8.0	In contrast, his teacher, who is also a doctor, told him this product would not increase the price because of the lack of curative effect.
8.0	Joe believed the mechant rather than his teacher.
8.0	Eventually, Joe failed to sell the medicine and lost a lot of money.
4.0	Second, correct information would do a considerably help for us becauce of the accuracy.
8.0	If we had take many different sources of information, no one can insure that all the messages are correct.
8.0	It is improtant for us to get correct information when we want to resolve the math problems.
8.0	Every difference of the numbers will affect results.
8.0	So it is important for us to take the correct information.
4.0	Third, the relevance of the information is also a important factor.
8.0	We can illustrate the reasons by the example of taking a test.
8.0	Every test has the range of the knowledge.
8.0	For instance, the teacher is going to test the chapter one, you would not get a good grade if you were review the others chapter.
8.0	So does the information.
8.0	It would not help us if it was not relevant.
1.0	From what we have discussed above, we can draw the conclusion that getting information from many different sources sometimes are not good to us.
1.0	The accuracy and relevance is more important when we obtaining the correct information.
12.0	I don't think offerring money is a good way to award children's hign grade.
12.0	Firstly,the school-age kids are lack in self-decipline and sometimes they use these money to buy something that cannot help improving their studying,even damage to their body.
11.0	Parents should know what thier kids want and whether it is a good choice rather than give them money directly.
6.0	Secondly,once the kids get the money,there could be a image that the high grade equal to massive money in their mind.
9.0	The kids is always greedy,the probability of cheating in the test for geting money to buy something they need could rasing if their parents set this regulation.
9.0	I remember that my young brother cheated in the exam for games.
1.0	Finally,I think the purpose of studying is to let kids know the world and society.
1.0	There many choices to award kids who get the hign grade,but give them money is the best method in my opinion.
9.0	My father took me to the gym to watch a basketball game and then I usually play basketball in my spare time.
9.0	It not  only courage me to study hard and get higher grade, but help me cultivating a new hobby.
11.0	In daily life, there are various ways for us to relax ourselves like watching movies or reading books and doing physical exercise.
11.0	The whole ways are effective for us to relax our minds or bodies.
6.0	Watching a movie or reading a book is suitable for us to relax our minds.
9.0	When you are sorrowful, watching a comedy may make you laugh and forget your sadness.
9.0	When you are depressed, reading a autobiography of a famous people could let you pull yourself together.
10.0	Moreover, it's also important to relax our bosides.
3.0	With the development of our society, we have an increasing number of different works to choose now.
3.0	Many employees are consider which kind of work is better.
3.0	For example, when there are two kinds of work, a work with various types of tasks to do and a work with similar tasks to do everyday, I prefer the former one.
6.0	First, when people have different tasks to do all day long, life will be full of challenges and new things.
8.0	So it will be more interesting to face a great variety of new things rather than doing one thing everyday.
8.0	I have read a research, which is about what people's doing influence their mood and health.
8.0	It presents that, as people do tasks out of interest, ninty percent of them will be happier then people who do boring tasks.
8.0	Also, happiness can lead to good health.
8.0	The odds to have cancer, insomnia, and many other diseases, wil be declined when you are happy.
8.0	Take myself for example, I used to have insomnia which bothered me a lot.
8.0	At that time, I was doing almost the same thing all day long, such as listening to class, writing my papers, and listening to class, then writing my papers.
8.0	I have nothing else to do.
8.0	But when one day, I used my spare time to do sports like swimming, running, and climbing mountains, my life become more interesting to me and it is even colorful.
8.0	After that, I had no insomnia at all.
2.0	Second, different types of work can make our life seem to be more busy, which can help us feel our future are under our own control.
3.0	Nowadays, an intersting discussion has arisen among the public: whether the teachers should get a salary as much as doctors, lawyers or business leaders get.
3.0	Some people think it is reasonable to get the same income for those vocations.
12.0	However, from my perspective, I disagree with this idea.
12.0	Teather should not be paid at least as much as doctors or other vocations are paid.
10.0	Here are the reasons I will explain.
4.0	First, the population of teachers is more larger than the amount of doctors and lawyers.
8.0	If the teachers get the same payment as that of doctors, the fanancial support of government will be cost rapidly.
8.0	As is known to all, with the development of human population, more and more infants are born everyday, which means the number of student is increasing.
8.0	So, the number of teacher is correspondly enhanced.
8.0	Government should keep the balance between the salary of individual teacher and the increasing number of teachers.
8.0	However, the number of doctors and lawyers is small.
8.0	If the teacher get the same payment as the doctors or lawyers.
8.0	The cost of government will be huge.
4.0	Second, the teachers' working time is shorter than other vocations like doctors, lawyers.
8.0	It is universally acknowledged that the teacher only needs to teach students in the weekday and they have two periods of vacation in one year.
8.0	So, the amount of work for a teacher is far less than the doctor who needs to speed greatly long time in accompansion with the patients.
8.0	The doctors is reasonably deserved to get the higher payment than that paid for teachers.
8.0	So it is with the lawyer, who should be devoted into huge amount of work in judgement.
4.0	Admittedly, teacher is still a great vocation for its delivering education to students.
9.0	However, the teacher should not get the too much higher income.
9.0	They have other ways to be cridited, like getting a long period of vacation, which is a big gift for the teachers.
2.0	Taking everything into account, I think that teacher should not be paid  as much as doctors or lawyers are paid, not only for the hugh number of teachers, but also for the less heavy work done by teachers.
3.0	Nowadays, with the development of society, people get rich, and they have more and more ways of life.
11.0	Many people like traveling to foregign countrries is better than traveling in own countries, because traveling to foreign countries can broaden horizons.
11.0	But l have different lidea, l think traveling in own country is better, because traveling in own country can save the money and security than foreign countries.
5.0	First of all, traveling to foreign countries will speed a lot of money,  as we know  air tickts are very expensive,and also hotel chager is often expensive than own country.
8.0	While traveling in own country is more cheap than foreign country.
8.0	Although most people think traveling to foreign countries can broaden horizons, but traveling in own country also can broaden horizons.
8.0	In the tourist attractions usually have people from different city, so we can community with each others and get know some differents cultures.
8.0	So traveling in own country is beteer than foreign countries.
5.0	Second, traveling own country is more security than foreign countries, because in foreign countries we when face some accidents nobody can help us, this situation will probably very dangerous.
7.0	For example, onece l traveling Thailand, l got sick there, but my English is so bed
7.0	so l can not find the hospital
12.0	I understand that nowadays it is very efficient for parents to offer money to their school-age children for stimulating them on each high grade.
11.0	As a matter of fact many people equate money with success from a young age: the more money you earn, the more successful you are.
12.0	However, thr financial aspect is not the point of a student's study.
12.0	The learning experience with one's classmates, the personal fulfillment from one's hard-working, and the opportunity to balance your study and relaxing time are much more important for a child.
4.0	A student who spend 12 hours everyday or more at their study just for money, in my opinion, should change their mind and enjoy their learning environment, especially the company of their classmates.
9.0	After all, the prospect of having to spend any amount of time in a classroom with people who does not respect, who are hostile, will have a very negative effect on one's disposition and mental health.
9.0	A few more money that parents put in the bank account can't compensate for this.
4.0	Similarly, a student should derive a special fulfillment or pleasure from his test.
8.0	One should not waste his time by doing something that is boring or of no use for his life even if it is well paid.
8.0	this is an important point that should be taught to a person from a young age, but what the parents do just have the opposite effects.
8.0	We should keep in mind that the money earned only enrich one's life away from work but not enhance the work experience.
4.0	Finally, the study life can only be enjoyed adequately if there is enough interst in your learning experience.
8.0	Afluence affords many nice things, such as games, toys or other things you dreamed of, but a person who has to study night and day just for money without any happiness will not be able to derive any pleasure from them.
8.0	Also, a father or a mother who provides a lot of money for their children might be able to attract them into getting a higher grade, but how much good does that do if their children never respect his study?
8.0	Thus the money offered to get a high grade might cost a person more than it affords.
11.0	Although hardworking is pretty important ingredient for one's success, the help from one's family is also ignorable.
12.0	Which period is the help from one's family more important?
12.0	Nowadays or in the past?
12.0	For me, the help from one's family play a priority nowadays than before.
5.0	In the first place, nowaday people's though is more liberate; therefore, children's success does not lock by their rank.
8.0	It was a common phenomenon in the past that  children must followed their parents' vocation.
8.0	Therefore, if you wanted to a engineer in the past and you parents were labor, it is impossible for you to achieved your dream whatever you were smart or hardwork.
8.0	However, nowadays people's thought is liberated and the rank disappear.
8.0	In this way, even your parents are labor, you can still to be a engineer in the future through study hard and go to a top university.
8.0	In this way, you parents can help you to get a good grade by mornitoring you and add tutor courses to you in order to help you master more knowledge.
8.0	Thus, it is much easier to achieve our goal with help from our family nowadays than before.
5.0	Secondly, as more technic device come into our life, it is more easer for our parents to help us achiving success by using these technology.
8.0	It is known to all that getting a good grade is pretty important for us to go to a top university and achieve our dream.
8.0	With the help from up-to-dated technology, our parents can use them search a myriad of knowledge and lots of good means to study help us absorb quikly although they have not too much knowledge.
8.0	However, my mother could not get help from their parents on study because their parents never got high level education and they absolutely had not technic device to help them solve academic problems.
8.0	Therefore, nowadays our parents can help us to achieve success more than before.
0.0	Finally, nowadays there are no more children in the family as past; thus, childrens nowadays can get more investment on education than before.
0.0	It is common that the family have one or two childrens nowadays; howewer, in the past there were even more than five children in the family.
0.0	In this way, nowadays children can use get more investment on education from their parents and lots of children even got chance to study abroud.
0.0	This good chance was rare in the past because to feed all children in a big family still was a tough issuse.
0.0	Therefore, nowadays people can achieve their success more easily with help from their family nowadays than before.
3.0	Nowadays, to encourage their school-aged children to study harder, some parents will offer their children money if they get a good grade in school.
3.0	Their children would most likely to study hard to earn the money.
3.0	It is a win-win for parents and their children.
11.0	However it is not always a good idea.
5.0	Since parents offer money to children when they get a good grade, they would mistake getting a good grade is the most important thing.
8.0	Some kids will study hard for it while others, however, would learn to cheat.
8.0	They would think of ways to get a good grade easier and start copying others' test papers.
8.0	If they were not caught, they still get the money their parents offered them.
8.0	After that, they copy more and not reaching their parents goal.
5.0	Some kids would think their parents care about their grades more than anything which is not the truth for most times.
8.0	These children are usually good at studying at first but then started getting lower scores.
8.0	They would be in a bad mood because they are not staisfyed of their scores.
8.0	If this continues, they would be in depression.
8.0	Some of these children would even commit suicide because of the pressure they have got from others, but mostly from themselves.
1.0	In conclusion, although parents got the idea of offerig money to their children in order for them to study hard, it is not always a good idea.
1.0	Children mistake their parents' idea and starting to cheat, kids getting too much pressure and commit suicide is happening around the world every minute.
3.0	In recent years, increasing number of parents would like to offer lots of money to their school-age children for each high grade.
3.0	This is a way that parents express their love to their children.
3.0	Nowadays, there are hug areas that need students to spend  money, such as books and interesting courses.
3.0	However, the school-age children have not enough time , energy and skill to earn money.
11.0	As far as I am concerned, this way doing by the parents is very useful and helpful for their children.
5.0	First of all, in lots of areas in the society, school-age children still need money to obtain the change to learning more.
8.0	In recent decades, our society is not very advance and  also very lack of money,  there is not enough money to prepare for the children study.
8.0	Meanwhile, for learning courses and interests,  Children need more money to support their study and obtain their opportunity.
8.0	Therefore, the parents provide money for their school-age children is very useful and helpful for their children's study.
5.0	Secondly,  the school-age children have not enough skill and time to obtain enough money.
8.0	The school-age children are always too young to obtain the skill of earning money.
8.0	Furthermore, they should spend time in learning.
8.0	They also need the help from their parents.
7.0	The parents should surport  money
3.0	The question which is better to relax, watching a movie or reading a book, or doing physical exercise, is a complex and controversial issue.
3.0	A majority of people believe that watching movies and reading books are better because these ways give people huge space to imagine.
3.0	However, people in increasing number hold the opinion that doing physical exercise is preferable.
11.0	It is significant to recognize that doing physical exercise is beneficial for most people.
5.0	To begin with, doing physical activities facilites the maintenance of health for people.
8.0	There is a tendency that people work and study for a long period of time without enough exercise to keep healhy.
8.0	In this case, doing physical exercise is pretty important for people to relax.
8.0	For example, my younger brother, who studies in high school now, hardly ever takes part in extra activities due to large quantities of workloads at school everyday.
8.0	For one time, he got seriously ill for lack of sports.
8.0	Finally his parents took him to see a doctor and he was suggested to do exercise everyday.
8.0	And later took some time for running a day and kept it a habit.
8.0	He got recovered within a week time and realized the importance of outdoor exercise.
8.0	Therefore, by doing physical exercise, people can not only relax but also keep healthy.
5.0	In addition, doing physical exercise periodically can strengthen the relations between friends.
8.0	For instance, activities required cooperation, especially playing basketball, create an opportunity for people to communicate and collaborate with each other, making your relationships stronger.
8.0	Before a baketball match, people should communicate with friends about the strategies that can be used in the competition.
8.0	And during the match, they need to collaborate with each other to better progress this competition with other people.
8.0	And this process gives people means to compete in the match and finally get relax after the match.
8.0	This physical activitiy strengthens people' relations and relax themselves.
2.0	In conclusion, doing physical exercise is a preferable way to refresh yourself, especially after a long time work.
12.0	Whether parents should let their children make mistakes and lte them learn from it become a debatable question nowadays.
11.0	From my perspective, leave children do things wrong and allow them learn from their ow lesson can be more effective.
4.0	To begin with, children have the right to make errors, because they are just imperfect  young people, and learning from their own mistakes can make the memory more unforgetable and long-lasting, even for their whole life.
8.0	For instance, my sister Mary always became distracted in class and always unwilling to do her homework.
8.0	Concequently, she failed in most of her exams and became the worst student in her class.
8.0	Fortunately, she became aware of her error and learned the significance of study.
8.0	In hence, she gtes up early to recite English words and do extra home work till midnight.
8.0	After a semester, she became the top 5 inher class and she insisted on studying because she will never forget the hard time when she failed and was looked down upon by her classmates.
4.0	Moreover, the behavior shows the tolerance of parents and help develop a healthy relationship between parents ahd children.
8.0	No one are born perfectly and it is natural for little child to make errors, so parents should just take it as normal thongs and not punish their kids.
8.0	For example, my friend Tom lost his expensive toy car due ti his careless when he was a kid but his parents did not scored him in stead they let him think about the whole thing by himself.
8.0	So, up to now, my brother is still willing to communicate with his parents about his problems because he know his parents has the tolerance and they have a good relationship.
4.0	Last but not least, letting kids make mistakes and correct them on their own can make kid know how to behave themselves.
8.0	Parents should interfere when their children do something wrong.
8.0	When children know they have to pay their price for their doing, they will want to behave beyyer and make less trobles.
8.0	My friend Bob, always eat lots of snacks when he was a child even his parents told him not to do so.
8.0	Later he became extremely fat and has the illness of obisity.
8.0	It was the illness that let him know the inportance of keeping fit, so now he goes to the gym 3 times a week in order to stay healthy, preventing the same thing happen agaun.
1.0	All things considered, is an effective way for parents to do so.
1.0	For its long-lasting effectiveness, the equal relationship it created, and the willingness for children to behave better from the bottom of their hearts.
3.0	Nowadays, mang young elites are back their coutry with their high diplomas and the experiences of studying broad, trying to do some important things to change the country.
11.0	However, in my opinion, younger people still have a lot to learn from elder people, it is the proper time for them to learn, not to make decision.
11.0	So I agree with that the young people today have no influence on the important decisions tha tdetermine the future of society as a whole.
4.0	First, the young generation's experience is much less than the older generation, which would make them be struggled with making decision.
8.0	For instance, the president in every country is always the mid-aged man.
8.0	They understand what the country needs in the situation right now, they know what the society needs because they have already experienced.
8.0	However, the young elites rarely experienced this.
8.0	Although they got high diploma in the most prestigeous school, they could not understand what the society needs and what the citizens need.
8.0	Their mind is not matured yet, so most of the time they could not make the right decisions under the pressure and certain circumstances.
4.0	Second, the younger generation are not calm as the old people when they face difficuties.
8.0	The older have already seen a lot international changes, they know why the events would happen and the similarities between these events.
8.0	They have seen more and experience more, so they could be more calm when the face difficuties.
8.0	There is an old Chinese saying: The older, the wiser.
8.0	I believe this saying deep in my heart because the young could could never see as much as the old.
8.0	So the new situation to the young is the familiar one to the old.
8.0	When the young are confused with certain situation and become struggled, the old could help to fix it.
4.0	However, it is not to say let the young making decision is a bad thing.
8.0	Sometimes the young people can change the world.
8.0	You can take the fonder of Snapchat as an sample.
8.0	He was only about 30 but the accomplishment he made was remarkable.
8.0	The young may be not as experienced as the old, but they can accept the new and fresh things more quickly than the old.
8.0	Without the creativity, the society could not improve.
0.0	As the result, the elites that the society need is a calm person even in the face of crisis; but the creativity is also the key of the construction of the society.
0.0	Nowadays the most important thing is to keep calm and stabilize the society.
0.0	So making the old to operate the society and make decision is more reasonable.
3.0	Nowadays, it's a common circumstance that some parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade or mark they get in school.
3.0	Parents take this action as an encouragement for their kids to persue better education level.
12.0	As a result, students do get much more higher mark on their examinations.
11.0	For its positive impact, I definitely support this idea as one of inspiring approach in education.
5.0	We all know that schools have scholarship regulations for those excellent students whether they have achieved great success in coursework or research.
8.0	Parents' giving money to children for their high grade is exactly a kind of scholarship in family field.
8.0	For instance, when I was at my junior high school, my father had made a rule with me that everytime I ranked the top 5 among my class in any significant test I can received a certain amount of bonus from him, if I ranked the top 5 among my whole grade in any significant test, then the number of money would surprise me.
8.0	Because of that rule, I studied extremely hard to reach my ideal position in the school.
8.0	Eventually I succeeded to enter a better senior high school after the graduation which I never thought that I could be enrolled before.
8.0	My father's educating experience on me  indicates that appropriate money encouragement is somehow indispensable for students' future.
5.0	However, the bonus is not always suitable for each family cause those parents who are facing with poverty surely cannot afford with the payment.
9.0	Under this circumstance, they mustn't choose this way to encourage their kids.
9.0	Instead, they can turn to purchase some special gifts as a praise.
2.0	Overall, the method is good for children to study hard in the school.
3.0	Both students and parents want to get a high grade during their study in the school.
12.0	Hence, some parents would use reward mechanism as a way of encouraging their children to put more effort on their study.
11.0	However, as far as I am concerned, give money to their children is not a good way of reward their hardworking.
12.0	I will provide several evidence as follows.
5.0	To begin with, the reward mechanism contains many ways.
8.0	For instance, a trip to other places or play a toy for them.
8.0	Especially offering a trip to them is a much wiser choice.
8.0	This is because the children can relieve their heavy burden of study pressure.
8.0	Moreover, they can exercise their ability of managing all sorts of problems and gain more experience and learn historical or geographical knowledge through their trips.
8.0	If parents just simply give their children money.
8.0	You don't know how they will spend it.
8.0	To make it worse, this will rise the problem of bandwagon effect.
8.0	Therefore, your reward could cause some negative effects.
5.0	Moreover, the parents should let their kids to realize that the hardworking study benefits themselves, the children should not study for the money.
8.0	And also to make a high grade is not a way of earning the money.
8.0	If parents offer money to them, the children may become more and more depend on this kind of reward mechanism.
8.0	And if someday parents stop rewarding them, they might stop studying hard.
0.0	To summerize, parents want to reward their children is a good thing, for they want to encourage their children's willing of study.
0.0	However, they should seek a right way of doing this.
0.0	To give their children money is definitely a bad idea.
0.0	This will pose a bad influence on their children, like bandwagon effect or let them misunderstanding the true meaning of study.
0.0	If parents consider a much better way to reward them, their children will gradually love studying, and make high marks consequently.
3.0	Currently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among student: we should listen to the advice of our friends, the advertisement or the salesman.
3.0	Opinion vary from person to person.
11.0	Some claim that the information of media and the salesman's suggestion is more useful to us.
11.0	However, contrary to their view comes my perspective that our friend's recommendations is the most suitable to us.
11.0	My point can be elaborated as follows.
5.0	Firstly, our friend's recommendation is more suitable to our life.
8.0	To be specific, just because they are our friends, hey will not have any benefit behavior,  they will only recommend to us what they think is useful.
8.0	On the contrary, if we listen media's suggestion, those said it was good just to trick us into buying it, not to really fit us.
8.0	So we won't really like the produc when it arrives.
8.0	For example, once, my friend and i went to the supermarket to buy washing powder.
8.0	He recommended me the one he used all the time, because we are very lazy and unwilling to use it very complicated.
8.0	At the same time, the supermaket advertisement says that there is a laundry effect.
8.0	The washing powder is very clean.
8.0	In the end, i didn't listen to the advertisement because my friend told me that the advertisement was to lie to the customer to buy it.
5.0	Secondly, friends will recommend us really affordable.
9.0	To be more specific, friends will tell us about the good deals they have selected.
9.0	Because we think the life should be diverse, so we do not need to spend too much money on these thing.
7.0	On the c
11.0	As people regard education as an essential part of life more and more, where the education budgets should be dvoted to rises to a hot topic.
12.0	Some people hold the view that money is supposed to be put into classes and libraries, while others believe that an equal amount of financial support should be given to sports and social activities at universities and colleges.
12.0	From my perspective, sports and social activities make a compelete campus life together with classes and libries, so I firmly agreewith the statement.
6.0	First, playing sports makes a person healthy and energetic to face the future challenges.
8.0	It can be seen everywhere that more and more students wear glasses, and too much reading along with facing computers for a long time makes it even worse.
8.0	Then they may suffer from eye problems or other physical diseases.
8.0	The only way of inproving this case is to encourage them to take some time relaxing in sports.
8.0	Futhermore, playing a ball game together is the best method to promote teamwork spirit.
8.0	After a period of playing together, members will develop a way to solve problems and achieve their common goal.
8.0	Therefore, sports strengthen one's body as well as enhance the spirit of teamwork.
7.0	Second, social activities an help foster abilities that students
7.0	annot gain during classes or self-stud
12.0	I agree the statement that people today are more willing to help the struggling strangers.
11.0	The reasons are following.
12.0	On the one hand,people today have better ability to help others,so they are more willing.
8.0	Formerly,althought people would like to help the truggling strangers,they have no time and no money.
8.0	But now,people can give them a hand easily.
8.0	For examp,rich men always choose to do charities.
8.0	They donate money or school to help poor students to finish their studies and achieve their dreams.
8.0	At present,all over the China,Yifu schools are built in every city.
8.0	Lucily,ShaoYifu are willing to help these struggling students.
8.0	Now,more and more people who have a warm heart and rich life desire to help studious students,which they never meet.
6.0	On the other hand, world need love.
8.0	Helping struggling strangers is helping ourselves.
8.0	Love is not undiractional.
8.0	Maybe someday you help me,I help her.
8.0	Then she helps you by chance.
8.0	There is a story about transmit of love and love between strangers.
7.0	It happened i
3.0	With the development of economy and technology，it provides lots chances for people to get better in their lives.
12.0	It  contributes much for them to live in a modern city that full of presure.
12.0	There is a discussion that whichi is better to relax in nowadays,watching a movie or doing physical exercise.
12.0	As far as I am concerned,watching a movie  is more good for people to have nice time.
10.0	First,I am of great interested in watching movies.
3.0	Do you argue with your parents because some famous star?
3.0	Can you understand that why your parents does not like some stars you love best?
11.0	The answer is most parents of us they do not like these celebrities and they also do not want us to be observed to them.
11.0	This is because, they have a lot of very realistic things to think like how to make money and they have different value with these young people.
5.0	Firstly, these older people they are too busy to pay attention to these famous star or athletes.
8.0	This is because they have lot of other thing to do and all of these things seem more important than these super star.
8.0	They should work hard for gaining more money so that their family can live a good life; they should take care of to their children and making meal or washing clothes for them.
8.0	All this things will make them crazy so it is hard for  him to spend time on the affairs of some super stars and athletes.
8.0	But on the contrary, the young people they do not need to pay attention on these life things and they feed by their parents so they have more free time and chance to focus on these stars or athletes they like.
8.0	Moreover the nature of the young people is interestd in all the funny things and some stories of some stars and entertainers are very appealing.
8.0	So we often talk them with our friends during the time in the school and the young people who have the same idol may make friends with each other.
8.0	All of this cause the celebrities are more important to young people than to older people.
5.0	Secondly, the value of the young people and it of the older people is different because they born in different generation and year.
8.0	Take an example of my brother and his mother, my brother is 17 years old and his thinking have large distinguishing with his mother.
8.0	His mother thought that he need to study hard at this age and did not think other things.
8.0	Unfortunately, my brother thought that the happiness was the most important thing in the world and people need to have a hero, Kobe is the hero of him.
7.0	And one time Kobe went to his city; he spent a lot of money to buy a ticket to saw this famous athlete but his mother thought it was
12.0	When asked about whether always telling the truth is the most important consideration in relationship, the overwhelming majority would support that honest is a valuable quality people desired.
12.0	However, others take the opposite attitude and assume that truth could hurt other's feelings.
11.0	As far as i am concerned, i believe that some truths could be more harmful than lies.
11.0	The reasons are as follows.
4.0	To begin with, sometimes truth could be so ruthless that relevant people cannot handle it.
8.0	People do not tell the truth for other's own sake.
8.0	For example, a person was diagnosed early cancer, the doctor suggested that keeping a positive attitude would benefit the effect assistant with the medicine.
8.0	The wife of this patient decided not to tell him the truth about tumor.
8.0	This patient thrilled and pick up hope again.
8.0	If the wife told him the truth, it would be hard for him to get rid of the cancer and keep in a good mood.
8.0	To some extent, concealing the truth might optimize the outcome we want to achieve.
4.0	Moreover, telling the truth regardless the situation would be inappropriate.
8.0	Small white lies usually are win-wins.
8.0	For instance, your friend asks your opinion about her beloved pop singer.
8.0	Although that singer is not your type, it does not matter if you compliment him to your friend, otherwise, she will feel disrespected and end the relationship with you assembly.
8.0	So when it comes to some irrelevant issues, proper with lies are required to facilitate the achievement of harmony.
4.0	Last but not least, there is not only white and black in the world.
8.0	Things are more complex and complicated.
8.0	It is very possible that there is no truth at all.
8.0	People only hear what they want to heat and tust what they want to trust.
8.0	Probably no matter how reasonable the truth is, when it is revealed, nobody is prone to believe it because that truth is far beyond their consciousness.
8.0	On the other hand, the truth people are telling may be subjective because it is the truth that he chooses to be truth.
8.0	Truth could be different from different perspective regarding the same issue.
1.0	To wrap up, taking into account of all these factor, we may reach the conclusion that always telling the truth might not be the most important consideration in relationship.
1.0	Sometimes truths are too overwhelming to cope with, sometimes irrelevant white lies can have positive influence, sometimes truth ate so hard to tell because it's subjective.
3.0	Parents give their children money when they get good grades in order to encourage them.
11.0	It may works because children can gain motivation to do something by earn money.
12.0	However, this method has its drawbacks.
5.0	Children may develop unfortunate thinking method during the process.
9.0	Parents give children money when they have good behavior, after a period, children may think they deserve to earn money because of good behavior, they will feel anxious and angry if they don't get their rewards.
9.0	These can be harmful to children, when they grow up and participate in sociaty, not all people want to praise their good behavior, if they feel angry in that situation, unwilling ending will caused.
5.0	Besides, children can be spured by rewarding, however, they probably will feel hopeless if there's no reward.
8.0	For instance, a children always get his rewards from parents, he stimulated by money thus he wants to get good grades.
8.0	Imagine that, he get a job in the future, and there's only few salary, or there's no salary at first.
8.0	For example, to be a volunteer.
8.0	He can't get enough motivation to work because there's no rewards in his job, and it's unfair to work without rewards.
2.0	However, parents can use money as a motivation for children to do their job sometimes, but they can't use it for each high grade children get in school.
7.0	Parents should notice that children can't distinguish
3.0	Wth the development of our ling standard, the ways contribute to our recreation varied from person to person.
3.0	Some people prefer watching a movie or reading a book for relaxing,while others choose physical exercise to relax .
11.0	Though movies and books are also things I usually do in  my spare time , physical exercise is a much better choice for people who likes sports or good at sports,like me.
5.0	Firstly, physical exercise helps us keep our bodies in good conditions,not only physically but also mentally,which is a solid foundation of our iife.
8.0	With the help of doing exercise,we can improve the function of body organiation,such as heart rate and speen function.
8.0	There is an old saying that a good physical condition is the foundation of our jobs, studies or even all aspect of our daily life.
8.0	If you are trapped by dissease ,you will suffer the failure in your life with lots of pain,which will also have negative influence on your family members or friends.
8.0	In addition to that,a good control of your emotion is also the benifit of physical exercise.
8.0	Through doing exercise, when you are facing with troubles, you would be able to calm down and adjust your attitude towards it,which is the first step of solving the problems successly.
5.0	Secondly, outdoor exercise contributes to releasing the stress you have in a hosipital situation.
9.0	The dazzled flowers and fresh air makes you feel like you are in a place without disappointment and under no pressure.
9.0	Also, you can make friends with whom you can chat and enjoy the joyment your new friends bring to ,while you are out for exercise.
7.0	There's good case in this point,I met my best friend, Lee,while I was playing baketball
3.0	With the decreasing of energy, people pay more and more attention to energy conservation.
3.0	Thus, a controversial topic has aroused a heated discussion among people: wether the best way to help deal with energy problem for government is to increase the price of gasoline and electricity.
11.0	Some claims that it is the best way.
11.0	However, contrary to their view comes my perspective that there are also another ways that should take precedence.
12.0	My point is well elaboratd as follows.
5.0	To begin with, the utilizing of alternative energy should be considered by government firstly.
8.0	To be specific, with the remarkable process of techology, there are many kinds of cheaper green energy showing up, such as solar energy.
8.0	Such energy can not only be recycling used but also save a lot of financial cost.
8.0	Therefore, citizen and factory might not overburden the fees of energy and government might not be worry about the emergency of energy shortage.
8.0	However, if the price of gasoline and electricity increase, the daily life of people and basic operation of industry will be affected.
8.0	For example, our government introduces a new solar energy system installed in the light beside the street, in this way our city cut down 1 million dollors in fees for energy and save electricity 100w a lamp per day.
5.0	In addition, publicity the sense of saving energy is also a better way to cope with energy problem.
10.0	To illustrate, only when the people's sense of engery conservation are enhanced can energy problem to be solved for a long time.
7.0	And the publizing relys on daily impacting from
12.0	My father always tells me to focus on one thing in order to succeed, but i accidentally saw in a TV show states that the broader knowledge you gain, the more possible you can be successful.
12.0	After watched that show, i started to think whether wide range of knowledge is of great importance.
12.0	In my opinon, broader academic knowledge have more advantages.
4.0	To begin with, the distinction among subjects becomes less remarkable.
8.0	To solve a problem in a certain field, you can use knowledge in another aspect.
8.0	For example, you can solve Biology problems through Math methods rather than in biology way since math can give you new perspective to deal with the tasks.
8.0	Through this connection, you can have better understanding of each subject and lead to more achievements.
4.0	Second of all, having wider knowledge is good for making friends.
8.0	If you are good at both Math and English, you will be able to exchange ideas with people who are specialized in Math or English.
8.0	On the contrary, if you only specialize in English, you only have conversations with people who study English.
8.0	All in all, the fewer fields you specialize in, the fewer people you are likely to communicate with.
4.0	Thirdly, wide range of knowledge helps people find well-paid job.
9.0	Nowadays companies want their emploees to be well-rounded developed.
9.0	Therefore people who have wide knowledge of academic subject is more likely to have important position in the companies and make contributions to the whole companies or countries.
2.0	Broadly speaking, specializing in specific subject has advantages, however, having broad knowledge is better choice for modern people because it helps them have more oppotunies to achieve their dreams, make more friends, have better understaning of those academic subjects.
3.0	With the development of the information era, children nowadays are very different from children in the past.
3.0	However, whenever asked about whether young people in the past depened too much on their parents while young people nowadays are better at making their own decisions, people always exhibit an air of uncertainty.
11.0	I wholeheartedly agree that young people now are better at making their own decisions.
4.0	To begin with, young people nowadays are more mature than young people in the past.
8.0	Nowadays, young people have the access to many information than young people in the past because of the widespreading of smart phones.
8.0	Thus, young people now know more things than young people in the past.
8.0	In this way, they can learn a lot of things happened in the society, which young people in the past can barely know.
8.0	So they are more mature to make decision about their own lives.
8.0	However, Young people in the past can be more innocent.
8.0	They have few ways to get information.
8.0	They didn't have smart phones, even internet.
8.0	They can only get information from the people around them, and sometimes adults may not tell them things that happened.
8.0	So they are too naive to make their own decisions.
4.0	Then, young people nowadays have the rights to make decisions about their own lives while young people in the past do not have the rights to make decisions.
8.0	Now, most families are living a happy life without many worries.
8.0	However, people in the past have a lot of difficult time to go through.
8.0	For example, they may had a time worrying about their food or crops.
8.0	So young peope in the past have no alternatives but to follow their parents to go through the difficult time.
8.0	They didn't have the condition that give them rights to make decisions about their own lives.
4.0	Last but not the least, young people now are more personalized than young people in the past.
8.0	In the past, the society required young people to follow what the leaders or the adults said.
8.0	They are restricted with strict rules, although those rules can be unreasonable.
8.0	Therefore, young people in the past did't cultivate the personalities to think differently.
8.0	However, young people now are freer, adults are more respect to their thoughts.
8.0	In this way, young people nowadays have cultivated their own personalities to think personally.
8.0	So,young people nowadays are more personalized than young people in the past to make decisions about their own lives.
2.0	To conclude, young people nowadays are better at making decisions about their own lives because of the change in society and many other factors.
3.0	A number of parents always serve their children with a majority money when their children are in studing,for supporting their wants and usual needs.
3.0	Nonetheless, some people may reckon that it may have a negative influence towards them,and the other may hold a view that it may make the children heading towards their dreams easily.
12.0	From my point of view,the parents should spare no effort to support their children.
5.0	I deem that if the children were wise and splendid, their way of chasing the high grades and the sprcific dreams will cost much money,becouse they would build up a higher achievement than anothers.
8.0	Thus,to support them,maybe,is no just for the family itself,but also for the whole society.
8.0	For the instance, the children may full of talence of mathmatics,he might have the opportunity to become the professor who will benefit the whole human society.
8.0	So,the parents should give him all they can do to support him with the corporation of the society.
5.0	Moreover it is pointed out by the moral code that the parents should give their children rights to think about whether should get to their dreams or not.
10.0	If they don't want to do so, the parents also should provide money for keeping them healthy and having positive moods.
2.0	There is no denying the fact that parents love their children.
9.0	Despite of chasing for money or social statues,they should support their guys puritily.
9.0	And it may release much of the stress of the societ by feeding the gunius with their own family.
11.0	Parents are always having the question whether they should let children do whay they want to do even make some mistakes or do everythin with children so that they will hardly make mistakes.
12.0	I thnik it is obvious that parents should let children make mistakes and let they how there mistakes hurt them and then learn from them.
6.0	Fistly, in my opinion, parents should let children do everything they want except something obey the laws.
8.0	We have to give a destination to children, which means a group that they have their own thinkings and have a right tend to goodness.
8.0	Upon the destination, these children are always try something that they desire to do, curious to know, which may also attaching mistakes.
8.0	Let us give a hypothesis to such suitation, something you really keen to do, but it may couse some mistakes and hurt you possbily.
8.0	A audlt, i think, is always choosing do it, let alone that you may learn from the mistakes.
8.0	With this conclusion, why we shouldn't let our children choose the same option?
8.0	Because of the age?
8.0	It definitely right to let children make mistakes and let them learn from their onw mistakes, so that they can not only do something they like., but also can make progree from mistakes.
8.0	It's a significantly important ability to make sure they can contuiously grow up when they live without parents.
2.0	On the contrast, if parents do not let their children confroud the challenges, do not let them have the chances to make mistakes, they may be always being afraid of trying something new, whcih may attribute to a phemomenon they can live like a ‘son’, even their ages are big enough, All in all, i think, parents should be confidefnt to their children if the kids have the attend to be good and honest.
10.0	Even they make some mistakes, it is the chance to make themselver stronger.
12.0	I think it is a good idea for parents to offer money as awards for the high grades their children get in school.
12.0	Firstly, most children don't really understand the benefits of high grades.
12.0	They cannot find the relationship between high grades and a good future.
8.0	So it might not be a good idea to tell them what benefits they will get when they grow up if they study hard.
8.0	Also, most people do not have strong willpower when they are young so that they might not spare more efforts on their study without awards or punishments.
8.0	As a result, children need some kind of motivation to push them to study hard.
8.0	I find that money is a strong motivation for many children including myself.
8.0	When I was young, my parents often offered me pocket money whenever I got high grades in an exam.
8.0	Honestly, the reason I worked hard at school was mainly the pocket money so I could buy candies and chips.
8.0	And actually I really did get high grades when I was a kid.
6.0	Secondly, evidence shows that high grades actually have a strong positive relationship with high salaries in people's careers.
8.0	So working hard at school have something to do with money.
8.0	If parents offer their children money for high grades they get in school, they will build up the recognization as soon as possible that if they want to gain money, they will have to study hard.
8.0	However, we also study for knowledge and pleasure.
8.0	So parents should also offer their children something other than money.
2.0	Above all, I consider it a good way to give their children money as a motivation for them to study hard.
3.0	With a remarkable progress of society, the pace of the modern life is quite fast.
12.0	Therefore, some people think that we humans will probably spend less time in the stuff of kitchen and food in the near future.
12.0	As for me, I hold the same point that more and more of modern people will put lots effort and time in the food stuff.
6.0	To begin with, spending less time preparing for the food allows people to finish other work.
8.0	Since people in the modern society suffer a lot of pressure from work, family or other groups, it seems nature for us to stay up late till midnight to finish our work or tasks.
8.0	So if we can spend less time on the meals, we will definitely complete more work than others which can make an advantage in the competition like hunting for a job.
8.0	Moreover, if you are under great pressure, you may be not in the mood for preparing food.
8.0	Imagined that when the final exams are coming, everyone in the class tries to get good grades, students might not want to fall behind others, so the are more likely to eat some bread for meals to save more time to prepare for the tests.
8.0	Even they decide to cook food by their own, they will not find any pleasure in doing this when their peers are all busy reviewing the materials and books.
1.0	Moreover, a shorter time for food preperation will can make people's lives more colourful.
1.0	It is because that if we want to shorten the food preperation time, we will more likely to eat out with others.
7.0	Thus, eating with
3.0	Many people in the society think that it is a good idea for parents to offer their children money for each high grade they get in school.
3.0	Maybe they think that this way can stimulate children to work hard.
11.0	However, I have a different idea that it is a negative way for parents to award and stimulate their children.
11.0	There are two reasons why I think in this way.
4.0	Initially, I think children would misunderstand the meaning of studying.
8.0	In this way, children will think that they study for their parents or money.
8.0	If they performance bad in next exam, they may think it is nothing and do not care that.
8.0	However, the most important advantage study an give children is knowledge.
8.0	Parents should help their children get interests in knowledge rather than money.
8.0	For instance, my uncle always takes his son to ocean park and go hiking when his gets good grade.
8.0	When they in the ocean park, he tells story about every speacies.
8.0	Then my cousin will be curious about that and learn a wealth of knowledge of ocean animals.
8.0	As time going, my cousin is major in biology.
4.0	Moreover, they will make money their motivation.
8.0	If they cannot get money, they may discard their study.
8.0	In this way, they would distory their featuer.
8.0	That the worst occasion.
8.0	For example, my uncle takes his son to park and do hiking in order to stimulate my cousin interests in the wild word.
8.0	Then he will
4.0	Even though I agree that this way can give children motivation to do better in some degree, I still think it would make children be more likely to rely on that and misunderstand the meaning of study.
1.0	Taking into account all the factor mentioned above, we may safely arrive the conclusion that it is a negative way for parents to offer money to award their children each time when they get high grade in school.
1.0	This is because
3.0	Nowadays, more and more frauds are waiting to deceive the kind people.
3.0	For example, even though the frauds are not be hit by the cars, they will lie on the road and ask for money, if poeple get down the car and try to help them.
11.0	Thus, people are becoming more and more indifferent.
11.0	However, even if we know that many people are deceived, lots of people are also willing to help the strangers which need help.
10.0	Therefore, I think more poople are willing to help struggling strangers.
5.0	First of all, I think many people are trying to use the kind actions to motivate the bad people.
8.0	When bad people did bad things, they will feel guilt.
8.0	Lots of people consider that if they still help those poeple no matter if they are indeed need help, the number of frauds will decrease, and more people are willing to help strangers instead of being afraid of helping others.
8.0	For instance, my mom was once deceived by a lier who claimed that the car my mom drived hit him.
8.0	He succeeded.
8.0	However, few months past, when my mom still drive through this street, the lier still happened and tried to deceive my mom twice.
8.0	My mom recognized him, but she still helped him.
8.0	When the fraud was going to deceive my mom,  he also recognized her and was surprised by my mom's action.
8.0	He asked the reason to my mom, and my mom said that only to pass the love to others, the world can be filled with love.
8.0	Ever after, he never came out.
8.0	Thus, if there is the person like my mom, the people are more willing to help strangers in order to pass the love.
5.0	Furthermore, the people nowadays have more quality, so they are more willing to help struggling stragers.
8.0	For example, when I was in the primary school, our teacher taught us that it is a good virtue to help others as a happy action.
8.0	We have to acknowledge that the children in today's society have more awareness to help the people who need help.
8.0	The textbook includes that passage that a student called Xiao Ming help a blind people to cross the sidewalk, and he is praised by others.
8.0	Thus, the children try to become good, so they are more willing to help the struggling strangers.
1.0	To sum up, even though the world is more complicated now, there are still some kind people who are willing to help the others who are not familiar with.
1.0	That is the virtue we all seek for.
3.0	Have you ever seen the streets of the city is becoming filled with cars?
3.0	Have you noticed that there is a tendency to develop self -driving car which is expected by the public?
3.0	Have you felt that the needs of bus are still increasing?
3.0	All of this are reminding us of that the car is very important in our daily life, so the number of cars won't decrease.
5.0	First, people are becoming more and more dependant on the cars and we can not live without cars in our life, which can be speculated by the jam happening just around us.
9.0	There is no doubt that jams are happening frequently in our life, which refers to the increasing number of cars.
9.0	In some big city, such as Beijing and Shanghai, if you interview some people in just on street, they will tell you that they have been greatly influenced by jams and plentify cars.
5.0	Secondly, you can not deny that the technology of self-driving car is become more and more mature.
8.0	Few months ago, it was reported that there was a experiment to measure the ability of self-driving car invented by Google.
8.0	And the car has shown us that its safety and avaiblity which is suggested by the expermients done in these months.
8.0	In case of that, the car will provide us with better service because we don not need to control it by ourselves, it can drive itself, we can go everywhere we want to go without spending much attention.
8.0	And this does indicate us that the cars are still of great use in our life and we can not lose it.
0.0	Lastly, the public transportation, such as the bus, still plays a significant in the society.
0.0	Almost everyone need to go for work by bus.
0.0	I have experienced a lack of bus.
10.0	I was so worried because without bus it was impossible for me to get the place in time.
7.0	And this can tell us that cars won't disappear even twety years ha
11.0	"In my opinion, it is very hard to say ""good"" or ""bad"" absolutely."
11.0	As we all know, everything has its advantage and disadvantage.
11.0	So I could only say that these parents' behavior is resonable.
4.0	The advantage for parents to do so is that when their children are still a student, it is very important for them to study well and acquire more knowledge.
9.0	To do well in study, they certainly need to devote themselves to it and they may not have enough time to make money themselves.
9.0	So parents can give them a hand.
4.0	And the disadvantage is that if parents give money to their kids, the children will lose a lot of opportunities to work, improve themselves and be more able when making money themselves.
8.0	Actually the benifit their experience to work can bring is far more than the money they made, this kind of experinces can make children know more about the sociaty, become more hard-working and diligent.
8.0	After woking, they will know that it is not easy for our parents to support us, so they may also become more responsible.
8.0	And all these good qualities will certainly bring them a brighter future.
4.0	I think whether it is good for parents to offer their school-age children money depends on the condition and personality of the child himself.
9.0	If a child who do very bad in his study is very outgoing or once had this kind of experice, parents can consider give him money and let him study hard.
9.0	But as for a student who do not has many problems in school, I think he is supposed to earn money himself.
2.0	So the two ways are both resonable, and relatively speaking, I think it is better for a child to make money by himself and have more experience.
11.0	Yes,I think these parents,who offer their school-aged children money for rach high grade they get in school,are cleaver enough.
12.0	The aim of them is to encourage their children to work harder.
11.0	Children in a young age can hardly pay all their attention to their study and this way is the most effective one to attract them.
5.0	Reasons are as follows.
8.0	In the first place,children may like to buy some snacks or toys to eat and play after school.
8.0	So that if they would like to spend money on something,they must work hard to get high grade,which requires them study day and night.
8.0	What's more,when your children find that their friends can get money from their parents by hard work,they will try their best in the class and attempt to gain money  from you to buy what they really want,too.
8.0	Last but not least,if you offer money when they get high mark,it will make them understand the importance of knowledge,which will be benefit for them in the future.
8.0	If only they can get abudent knowledge in their childhood,they would be ready for their future work and daily life,which is the most significant.
5.0	From my personal perspective,I do like this solution very much.
8.0	For example,it is my boy,who is only 14 years old in a middle school,ask me to take this way to encourage him.
8.0	In the begining,he was attracted by computer games or basketball and often failed in his exam because of absenting  the class,which made me sad and anxious.
8.0	So I just tried this way for some time.
8.0	As a result,he always be the best student in his class and even in the whole school now.
8.0	In conclusion,I insit that we can effectively improve our childrens study,by using this method.
3.0	In nowadays, more and more parents are concerned about thier children's education.
12.0	In order to encourage their child, parents may use differant ways.
12.0	It is a saying that some parents will award thier child some money when they get high grade in school.
12.0	Perhaps some people will think that this way is excessive for the child because they don't know how to spend it.
11.0	As for me, I agree with this reward system, so here are three reasons to support my opinion.
5.0	As the old saying goes, ' no pains, no gains.'
8.0	So if the child want to gey that reward, they have to study hard.
8.0	In this way, it can encouage them to study harder.
8.0	So, this can stimulate thier intrest on study.
8.0	My cousins, Jack, once was very naughty, if you told him to sit down and study, he would totally run away and play outside.
8.0	One day, he wanted to by a transfomer toy, but, as you see, he did't have enough money.
8.0	My uncle got an idea.
8.0	He told my cousin if he would get enough grades at school next time, he could get a summary of money.
8.0	This method changed my cousin immediately.
8.0	After he konwn this, he started to work hard and really success in next text.
8.0	So you see, with this ways, my cousin successfully changed his bad habits.
5.0	Give children some money can also help them to manage thier own finance.
8.0	If they get the money, they will start to think about waht they can buy with it and what else they can do with this award.
8.0	This will gradually culture thier financial ideas.
8.0	They will get independent in this way.
8.0	Take my own experience as an example.
8.0	I got a sum of money myself in the spring festival when I was eight.
8.0	When I received the money, it is hard to think what I can do with it.
8.0	To not waste my money, I make a plan to save my money in a bank for half a year, and after that I could take it out and buy a book which would public right at that time.
8.0	I made this and I felt really proud with this step.
8.0	So I really think this is a good way for parents to award thier children.
2.0	Though there are indeed some disadvantages with this situation, but above all, I think the advantages far outweigh than disadvantages.
3.0	Nowadays, partial parents tend to prize their children with money when they did well in the examination.
3.0	In my view, I am standing with them.
11.0	The reasons are as follows.
4.0	First of all, to some extent, this money could inspire their children to work harder to get the prize.
8.0	At first, they might get a sense of fulfillment and enjoyment, which could indicate them getting good marks is right for themselves.
8.0	Then, they are possibly to put more efforts to get a good result again, whcin is highly helpful for them.
8.0	This could be a good approach to cultivate their children in a appropriate way.
4.0	Second, the money they get could be a kind of motivation to inspire them to study harder.
8.0	As we know, study is a boring and annoying sometimes, students, who are in their young ages, may cannot burden this pressure.
8.0	When they receive the prize, they may consider it as a target.
8.0	They could be really stimulated from the prizes.
8.0	Also, recognize by their parents is beneficial to their mental health.
4.0	Although some people would argue that the students are likely to use the money to do things like going to an internet cafe or a game room.
8.0	This could lead them into a wrong way.
8.0	Nevertheless, students who cannot get this prize would do the same thing by asking for money from their parent in a tricky reason.
8.0	For example, I prayed my mom for some money by using the reason that I am going to pay for the school stuff.
8.0	However, I use the  money to play vedio games instead.
8.0	Hence, it won't be a potential risk for children.
2.0	In summary, offering children money when they perform well in school is a good way to set students in a better expectation.
3.0	With the development of our society, we have an increasing number of options about our life, our study, and our work.
3.0	For example, which way of working or studying will make you satisfied?
3.0	Doing various types of tasks or doing similar things everyday?
12.0	As for me, I prefer the former one.
6.0	First, doing a great variety of tasks all day long will presents more challenges and more fun.
8.0	More challenges and fun will make us be interested in those tasks.
8.0	And I have read a research which states that, as people are doing tasks out of insterest, they will be happier than those who does similar things all day long.
8.0	Also, happiness lead to health.
8.0	Another research indicates that among people with more happiness, ninty percent of them will have lower odds to have cancer, insomnia, and other diseases.
8.0	Take myself as an example, I used to have insomnia when I kept doing the same tasks everyday, such as listening to class, writing my papers, and listening to class, then writing my papers.
8.0	But one day, I changed my life routine, I used my spare time to try some different things like swimming, climbing the mountain, taking other classes provided by another professor.
8.0	Soon I was happy and had no insomnia at all.
8.0	So it is more satisfied for me  to have many different types of tasks to do than having similar things to do during the workday.
1.0	Second, when we are doing different tasks, it seems busier for us than doing similar tasks all day even though we may worked for the same hours.
1.0	In that case, we can feel a strong sense that our life is under our own control, and have a better expectation to our future.
8.0	Take cousin for an example.
8.0	"When she kept doing almost the same tasks during the workday, she always complained to me saying:""I fell hopefulless, and It seems like my life has gone out of my control."""
8.0	However, after I encouraged her to change her life like I used to do, she has made more new friends and now, she is looking forward to her future.
11.0	Some people hold the opinion that it is a better choice for children to get jobs similar to their parents than that different from their parents' jobs.
11.0	Some people may disagree it but  I can't agree more with this good opinion!
11.0	There are 3 reasons as follows.
5.0	Firstly, I do hold the view that interests for a job are raised from sufficient exposure to the job.
9.0	As parents's jobs are exposed  to children more easily than other people's, so they can form interests even love for these jobs naturally in growth with there  parents.
9.0	We can see many children from film stars show interests on acting from many TV shows.
5.0	Secondly, parents always accumulate a great number of skills and knowledge in working life of many years, which is often very useful in working.
9.0	Of course, parents will teach their children competitive skills or knowledge if they show love for this jobs and will do similar jobs.
9.0	So these children will do better than their parents and will be more professional when they take up these jobs than many other children with no parents in these jobs!
10.0	Thirdly, if your parents have many human, material or knowledge resources, these form a great platform for these children to succeed in these job areas.
7.0	All in all, though everyone has own personality  and individulity, to choose a similar job to your parents' will receive success quickly
3.0	All parents would use money on children's education, then it course that more and more children want gain money for each high grade them get in school from their parents.
11.0	Some one agree this because they want their children could have a good sense in school life.
11.0	But in my opinion, I think it  is a bad way for the children.
6.0	If the parents offer their school-age children, then most of them will use this money to buy some junk food.
9.0	That make the bad effecative of children's health.
9.0	For example, my friend Y. His mother give him much money when he was grade 6, then he always buy some fast food like KFC.
10.0	At last year, he become a
3.0	Recently, some parents will give their children more monny if they get higher grade in school.
11.0	In my opinion, it is not a good idea.
11.0	Genearlly speaking, although it may urge students to study hard, it will lead to negative influence on their development in the future.
4.0	In the beginning, offering childern by the mark can make them greedy.
8.0	Childern are usually pure, and they just want the things they like.
8.0	However, after getting money due to high mark, they may believe that it is a easy way to get money, so that they can purchase something they like, such as toys and snack.
8.0	For students who are clever, they may think that they are good at study and thay need more monry to prove that they are better than many other classmates.
8.0	Thus, childern will become greedy at home for waiting for more money.
4.0	Besides, school-age childern offered money by mark will lose the interest to study.
8.0	When it becomes a tool to get money, childern who want to get much more money may try the best to study.
8.0	If they study only for money, it will be difficult for them to find the interesting things to study.
8.0	Studying day by day with too much time, study will be boring for them.
8.0	When they go to the university, if their parents will not offer money by mark, they will not focus on study because thinking that study is very boring.
4.0	Last but not least, it is not fair for parents to offer money by mark.
8.0	Not all of students can gain high grade in school.
8.0	Everyone has their own advantages.
8.0	Some students are warm-hearted to help others, while some students may be good at sports.
8.0	Grade in school is not the only way to evaluate a child.
8.0	Therefore, parents should not offer money only by the mark.
2.0	In a word, it is not a good idea for parents to offer their childern for each high grade.
3.0	Nowadays, the ability of adapting is becoming as significant as the knowledge we learn.
11.0	This also make sense when it comes to working.
12.0	At the present, we cannot have perfect performance unless we are able to adapt to the group we are in.
11.0	And socilizing is also crucial in our work, which is something we need to adapt to when we are in a new work environment.
5.0	First, we need to coopreate with others to make us work better, for wich we need to adapt to the new environment.
8.0	For instance, a university classmates of mine, who was a programmerand  had very good grades in university, had a hard time recently.
8.0	According to his words, he could not work well with his collegue which made the groupwork not efficient.
8.0	He could not adapt himself to understanding the process of the group work immediately, which resulted in his confusing of what  phase the work enters.
8.0	When we got toghther, he told me that there is no better way to make you work well than adapt to the company environment.
8.0	Since only if you know excatly how the process the company take to write codes and what strategy company take when meeting problems about the bugs int he codes can you follow your collegues.
8.0	Without the ability of adapting, you could be just a fool in the company and do not know how to write your codes.
5.0	Second, with good adaptation, we can learn how to get along with the leader and boss to prevent us from being criticized.
8.0	The example of Leijun is a case in point.
8.0	Leijun works very well about computer and can suddenly solve the problems the company face.
8.0	On the basis of this, he could have been praised by the boss.
8.0	But in the talking to introduce how he solve the problems, he did not know the temper of the boss and utilized some wrong words which made boss angry, which resulted in his later quitting job.
8.0	Afterr he became the EXO of Xiaomi, he talked to the young man and warn them that it was very significant to know how to get along well with boss and leader.
8.0	If he could used some words that the leader prefer at that time, it is of high possibility that he would be prompted.
8.0	In view of this, we can understand the importance in adapting to new environment which could let us know the leader's likes and dislikes to let them understand our work.
2.0	From the two points above, we can excatly know that adapting to new work environment is as important as excellent knowledge, and only with the ability of adaptation can we maximume our work efforts.
3.0	The answer of this statement depends on own experience and life style.
3.0	In my point view, offering school-age children money for each high grade they get in school is a pretty good idea.
11.0	Among countless factors which influence the choice, there are three conspicuous aspects as follows.
5.0	The main reason for my propensity is that rewarding money is a good way to encourage children.
9.0	When children got terrible grades in last examination, they might lose interest in learning or feel unconfident to do a good job.
9.0	If their parents reward them by money, children are able to get double sense of achievement after having high grades.
5.0	Another reason can be seen by every one is that the idea can make a virtuous cycle.
8.0	After children get money, they will use it to do the things they like.
8.0	The more money they get, the more lovely things they can do.
8.0	In order to finish the dream, children will try their best in studying.
8.0	Obviously, children become better in the virtuous cycle.
7.0	Futhermore, parents can use this method to develop the ability to manage money
3.0	Comparing to the society in argriculture civilzation, people in mordern soceity which is quite urbanizing, industrious and fast-step are more unwilling to help the strugglig strangers in my views.
12.0	There are many reasons to prove my points.
4.0	Firstly, the urbanization forced farmers to get out of their homeland and to get into a new city which is quite strange for them.
9.0	People as citizens are unfamiliar with their neibors because the aim to move into a city is to make more money not make satble living, so they pay more attention on their work rather than friends and the human relationships are suffered.
9.0	Since lacking knowing for others, people will easy to worry the results of helping struggling strangers like being cheated because of their benevelance.
4.0	Secondly, some people don't have enough time to give pity to strangers because of the fast living step.
9.0	For  instance, when you are waiting to cross the road and it is near the deadline of your arriving time for work, there is an elder fell down on the pedestrain but the light turns green and you can walk--what will you choose, go for your work or help the elder?
9.0	That's a moral dilemma and may cause half of the people to quit the thoughts of helping others.
4.0	Thirdly, our society are still developing and we don't have the perfect systems of laws to ensure the goodness paid by goodness rather than hurt.
10.0	Actually, now there are still many cases that people who help strangers in need but be cheated and hurt by them treated unfair by juges and laws.
1.0	From my perspectives, people today are more unwiliing to help struggling strangers rather than willing to do.
1.0	To alliviate this situation, we should advocate a social core value which can help people belive each others; the company should give more free time and government should establish a more comple
3.0	Nowadays, students face the missions are which cousres should they seleced.
3.0	And universities provides some required courses for them.
3.0	Such as history.
3.0	There is an argument happening, should all students take history courses or not, no matter what their subjects are.
3.0	In my opinions, I thinks it is necessaryfor anyone taking history course.
3.0	History can enrich one's knowledges.
3.0	Hsitory can let people make more friends when they are in the univeristy.
11.0	And taking history class can let people become more responsible.
5.0	To begin with, history can enrich one's knowledge.
8.0	There is my real experiance.
8.0	I take canadian history class in our school.
8.0	Before, I take this class, I am really do not understand any history events.
8.0	What is world war, cold war.
8.0	But,after I study this cours.
8.0	I find there are too many hsitory events relates to our lives.
8.0	I know how our society finally become nowadays.
8.0	So, history really can widen one's horizon.
5.0	Furthermore, take history can make more friends in universities.
8.0	For instance, there is a person who really do not know how to get along with people.
8.0	Hence, he feels boring and upset all smester.
8.0	He study by himselves, and eating meals himslef.
8.0	But, in the next semester.
8.0	He takes a required course--history.
8.0	He finds he likes this course a lot, and during the class, there are a lot of people who also love hostory.
8.0	FInally, he makes new friends.
8.0	History courses change his life.
0.0	In the end, stuying history course can make people become more responsible.
0.0	When a chinese student studys abroad, he meets some people who insult history of event.
0.0	Naking holocaust is not the turth, all chinese lie to the world.
0.0	But, the chinese student even do not know whether the events are true or not.
10.0	If the studet takes in history class before.
7.0	He must surely debate back to those people, and telling
12.0	I dont think its a good idea to give their children money when they get a high mark.
8.0	Because if you give them the money first they dony know learning is good to them self.
8.0	They will think if i get a high mark iwill get money every time and to buy everything i want to buy.
8.0	If you dont give them money,they know learning is for their selfs.
8.0	they may learning good.
8.0	But if they dont want to learn if you dont give them money.
8.0	You can tell them if you lean good i can give you money .
8.0	Secondtime  if they still want money,you still can give them money to buy the thing they want.
8.0	If you do like this,your children will love to study,and you dont need to give them money any more.
8.0	But if they still want money you can give them and tell them to know how to spend money.
8.0	For example,1/3 money can use to buy the things they want.
8.0	Other1/3 money can give to your parents or some people they need help of money.
8.0	The last 1/3 money you can put it in your little bag that you can use other time.
8.0	Then if your children sstill want money,gust do what you did last time.
8.0	like this your chidren can get what they want for high mark and still knows how to use money correctlly.
8.0	One years or two years they also can use their money to buy a big toy or some thing they want and still like this to spend money.
8.0	When your children grows bigger i think they wont want your money for study.
8.0	If they still want money i think you should talk to (him or her) that you grow so big that i cant still give you money like you in childhood.
8.0	He will know this because when every people grow bigger they know what they should to do.
8.0	If they still want money oh man why your chid still cant grow up.
8.0	You just can give them money and teach them how to use money.
3.0	Children nowadays shoulder heavier pressure than before, for they are expected to be excellent kids by their parents and teachers.
3.0	And one of the measurement of exllence is their school performance, for which children spend more time devoting themselves in the home work or organized activities.
3.0	An interesting discussion therefore has arisen among people: should children be given more time to do things they really eager to do.
12.0	Opinions are divided and personally speaking, my answer to the question is yes.
5.0	Giving more time to do tasks they wants helps him plan for their own future.
8.0	Because of the fact that their path has already been paved by their parents and teachers, children nowadays are increasingly dependent on others.
8.0	They even do not think about their future or dreaming career, for there is already planed by others.
8.0	This is appalling that children will finally become robots only follow the instruction by others without their personal thought and discretion.
8.0	Take my brother for example, what he truly liked to do is photographing.
8.0	However, my parents wanted him to be a good doctor then whose future would be more promising.
8.0	He buried himself in tons of reading materials to reach the goal required by them.
8.0	He surely is a doctor now, but with terribly negative attitude towards his career and he has no dream at all.
5.0	Also,  giving more time to do whatever they want shapes their own judgement.
8.0	Driven by their own curiosity and interest, they are more willing to explore the things they currently do, that provokes deeper thinking and fresh thoughts.
8.0	If something puzzled or trumbled them, they would just be fully involved in it anf tried to figure out the solutions ny themselves.
8.0	This process carves their thinking pattern and helps to form their own judgement.
8.0	My friend Tomy is exact instance.
8.0	He was given much free time to do whatever he wanted to.
8.0	His afterschool life was so colorful and impressive for me, such as doing chemistry experiment by himself and reading foreign language novels even he was mere a  primary school students.
8.0	By doing this, he always thought about many issue I never come up with.
8.0	And every time our teachers asked us to give comments about heated topic, he usually gave powerful and insightful speech that surprised all of our class.
1.0	In conclusion, children should be given more time to accomplish the things they really want to do, for that helps them to plan  for their own future and shapes their judgement.
1.0	With the freedom to fully become aware of what they are and what they really have passion in, children are surely perform better in their later academic performance and even their entire life.
12.0	When it comes to the issue about what is the best way to relax, people have different opinons, some prefer to watching movies, others may reading books  and some incline to doing physical exercise.
12.0	For me, i am prefer to watching a movie or reading a book compare to work out, base on the following reasons.
4.0	To begin with, it is convenient to select movies and books.
8.0	Since  i am a post graduate student right know, normally, i have to concentrate all my energy to assist my professor to do experiment.
8.0	During the test , i need to keep the record of every single detain of the changing of the object.
8.0	Under such hign stress, i almost exosted during day time.
8.0	After leaving the lab roome , i need to find an effective way to release my stress.
8.0	therefore, fiction movies and cosmic books are my favorite, i can get fun from them ,making me relax and refresh, since i have no extra physical energy to do exercise.
4.0	In addition, movies and books could help me to expand my social circle.
8.0	Recently ,  young people are spare less time to comunicate in public area.
8.0	most of us are use cell phones or weixin to change our ideas and connet our friendship.
8.0	In such cases, we are fond of talking the latest moves, the popular stars ,the plot of the exciting movies.
8.0	Also, books could bring us the latest living values, and the most recent thought of the youngests.
8.0	if i have the popular topic to share with my favorite friends, it makes me happy and relax.
8.0	Since i am an intrisic people, i like a quite place which is impossible  in gyms where there are many people doing exercise, and they are talking,chating ,making a lot of noise.
4.0	Finally , movies and books could offer me useful information when i spend spare time on them.
8.0	Movies especially documentary movies, which contain the valuable theme.
8.0	such as natural documentary moves,they have various series themes, and you could enjoy the charming wild senery, knowing the origin of the  singal plant, how they reproduce, their unique habitat and so on.
8.0	And the books are interesting too, some books could teach you basic medicine knowledge which is useful when you sometimes feel uncomfortable.
8.0	Especially , when youn taking a trip, and the hospital is far away.
8.0	All these accumulated knowledge from books could settle your trival problems and make your life easier.
8.0	That is why i choose to watch movies or reading books to relax myself.
2.0	All in all, for the above reasons which is mentioned and according to my current situation and physical status, the most effective way to save me from high stess is to enjoy movies or reading books compare to work out.
3.0	Parents always give prizes to their children when they get good grade in school and those prizes including money to encourage them keep wrking hard.
3.0	It's very common and reasonable.
3.0	Money is attractive, expacially when kids are young because they are easy to be content.
12.0	But it's may not a good behaviour to give money to their children.
4.0	First, it's harmful to set up right values.
8.0	If parent give their children money when they get good grade everytime, children will assume that money is the only improtant and useful things.
8.0	Whatever they do or others do, they did it for purchasing money.
8.0	They will built a very wrong values and igoner many other thing such as relationship and dream.
8.0	After they growp up, they will give up evething for money.
4.0	Second, it's not helpful to cultivate the habit of saving money.
8.0	When kids are young, they won't realize how hard to make money so they won't appreciate it and spend them on something unuseful without second thinking.
8.0	When I was young, I have a classmate whose parent are very rich.
8.0	His pin money more than everyone of us and he can get much more when he got good grades.
8.0	Guss what?
8.0	He addicted at computer game and put all his money on it.
8.0	So before we capable of using money correctly, there is no good effect to own too much money.
4.0	Third, children compare with the highter when they got some money for award.
8.0	When kids get money and buy something that others kid don't have, they will compare with each other.
8.0	It happens a lot when I was a kids.
8.0	It's a very inppropiate phonomonon.
8.0	And the best way to forbit is don't offer money
1.0	Overall, there is many other methods to award their kids, such as travelling and go to resturant.
1.0	I think there is no need to give money for each high grade.
3.0	The phenomenon that the majority of the people enjory relaxing by watching movie and reading books has been concerned and I am different from them.
11.0	From my point of view,I think the sports can provide me better rest.
4.0	Initialy,while we are doing sports,our body will create a kind of special stimulant,then you will feel energetic without feeling tired.
9.0	At this period of time,it is the better way that let you have a mental rest.
9.0	You will focus on doing sports without the anything terrible.
4.0	In addition,There are a variety of physical exercise in this world,but also there are many team physical exercise in this world.
8.0	While you are doing sports with your friends,you will feel very happy and shout to each others.
8.0	You will laugh and feel happy.
8.0	"As a famous saying goes:""The smile can let you live longer."""
8.0	It is the better way to let you feel relax,and it doesn't like watching movie and reading books.
4.0	Most importantly,Doing sports can reduce the stress.
8.0	Nowadays,many people in this world are under the huge stress,They stay up late most of nights.
8.0	They can't fall asleep.
8.0	The sports can let their body feel tired and have some mental rest.
8.0	When the people feel tired on their body,they will fall asleep.
0.0	To sum up,There are many adventages of doing physical exercise.
0.0	In my opinon,The physical exercise is also a good tool of relaxing.
0.0	The exercise can let you get stimulants,laugh and reduse stress.
3.0	Family and job are two big topic that we will face sooner or later, and how to balance the job and family is very hard to most of us.
3.0	As far as I am concerned, the family are better than jobs that offer us more salaries.
3.0	I have seen people who earn much money are unhappy for having no time to spend with family.
3.0	And it is alos very common that people's work is influenced by the family problems which are caused by the distance between them and family members.
12.0	Still, far from friends, our social need cannot be satisfied, which will shift out focus from work.
5.0	First, we earn money for happiness which is just staying with family and enjoying ourselves.
8.0	So what is our purpose of leaving family behind for more money.
8.0	I have seen a lot of relatives complain for having no happines since they have no opportunity to stay with family.
8.0	These people are always working in big city like Shanghai but they can just play with their sons in holiday.
8.0	What a pity.
8.0	The origin purpose of earning money is to make the whole family to have a better life quanlity.
8.0	But when they earn enough money , they find that they are far from their purpose because their time are filled.
8.0	Besides, I have also seen people who earn less money but they can go to Disney with their children to give children a childhood with no regret.
8.0	Undoubtedly, the latter person have more happiness and they can live a colorful and brightful life, which is the final purpose.
8.0	Then, I can say that spending more time with family is something that we should measure more than high income.
5.0	Second, some people often go abroad to meet costomers, which can lead to quarells between wife and husband, whcih will influence the work.
8.0	The instance of my uncle is a case in point.
8.0	My uncle always go abroad to attend crucial meetings.
8.0	Due to this, my aunt have no opportunity to communicate with him, then the problems between them are becoming more and more serious.
8.0	At last, my aunt porposed divorce.
8.0	Thus, my uncle could not concentrate on his own work any more because he thought all about the problems between him and aunt, and also he could not finish the work that was assigned to him.
8.0	Then he quit his primary job and found another job in our city, after that, I ccould always see the smile of my uncle and aunt.
8.0	Regardless of the family problems, he can always do the job perfectly because he can totally concentrated his mind on the job and did not care for the quareels.
8.0	Hence, the psychological problems did not exist any more, which is both beneficial for my unlce and his job.
3.0	Globally, diverse career can be specifically divided into different type of work; particular jobs may contain extremely diverse work to do or inconceivably monotonous tasks to finish.
3.0	Concerns like whether many different sorts of tasks or tasks that are akin to one another will satisfy workers most.
12.0	From my perspective, I prefer the point that many different types of work to do during the workday.
4.0	Admittedly, doing similar tasks the whole day will apparently be more relaxing and less challenging.
9.0	In other words, being sucked in things that are precedented will undoubtedly lower the pressure of unfinishing worl due to the difficulties and gey more stable wages without any errors to make due to familarity.
9.0	However, if one really master the career, such concerns will be eliminated easily for one will definately be confident about his or her own skills.
4.0	"In the first place, doing ""colorful"" tasks can promote the interest of workers."
9.0	That is to say, by confronting all variety of challenges and facing all sorts of new things, workers will obviously get interested as a sense of innovation and satisfaction come along; consequently, workers will be more willing to do such work due to the freshment of work, personal enjoyment and a feeling of never get bored.
9.0	Instead, if a particular work is done day by day, workers should have sucked and loosed the concentration and hence decresed the productivity due to lack of satisfaction of the work.
4.0	Secondly, doing different tasks enable workers to get higher salaries, hence satisfaction.
8.0	That is, as far as the public know, someone with more skills or capability will undoubtedly have less job mobility and more appreciation due to they can easily transfer to another kind of work if possible; thus, a firm will be more likely to hire such person with higher wages, for his or her unsubstitutional value and even unprecedentedly diverse abilities.
8.0	My uncle is such person who get strong satisfaction.
8.0	He was a successful manager of an international company not only for he once majored in business or economic, but also due to his amazingly diverse ability like computer programming, accounting and managing; consequently, not to mention his fertile salaries or bonus.
1.0	In conclusion, workers will obviously be more satisfied when they have many different types of tasks to do during the work day, for the durable interest and demanding wages.
1.0	Getting involved in similar tasks can never outweigh the benefits of diverse work, only when one have his or her own world rocked by interest and satisfaction will he or she find the meaning of the life and own value, so come and try such work!
12.0	"When people ask me about helping struggling strangers, I definitely will say ""I will""."
12.0	I trust most of us will says the same.
12.0	Because the environment of the world is totally different.
12.0	In comparison with the past years, everything is different.
8.0	The world is developing, people's thinking also are developing.
8.0	Struggling strangers will be helped more and more.
8.0	I have three strongly reasons to support my opinion.
6.0	First of all, most people's life is better now.
8.0	They have more basis things that can help struggling strangers, such as money.
8.0	They also have more spare time to do some meaningful things like this.
8.0	I would like to share a story, it was happened in recently.
8.0	Chapecoense is a soccer club.
8.0	When they flied to take the final match, their airplane fell and break.
8.0	Unfortunately, most of them died.
8.0	Just three soccer player survived.
8.0	After this, Football Club Barcelona helped them, they gave a lot of money.
3.0	People are always concerned about the moods and feelings about themselves, they regard those as the meaning of they living in the world, and use them as the indexes to judge whether they live a wonderful lives.
11.0	Some people say that people are less satisfied with their lives.
11.0	But I hold the opposite opinion, people now definitely are becoming happier and more satisfied with their lives.
11.0	With the development of all aspects of the society, people have more choices and their growing abilities enable them to arrange a better life for themselves.
5.0	First and foremost, the increase of the income free people from worrying about their daily expense, so they can improve the qualities of their lives.
8.0	The economy develop in a fast speed, and that lead to the people earning more money.
8.0	Since money is always the basis of life, people nowadays load off more burden than before.
8.0	In the past, people had a hard time making a living, they always had to worry about their lives, and some people who didn't have the abilitity to support the whole families have to make some hard decisions.
8.0	For example, when a father of two children didn't have enough money to let his both kids go to the college, he may spend a hard time deciding which kid can go to college.
8.0	But now we do not have the problem since most families have the abilities to support both children.
8.0	With little things to worry about, people will always stay in happy moods.
5.0	Secondly, the changing world provide a diverse choices for entertainment, that give people a relaxing enviroment, and keep them in a happy mood.
8.0	People in the past had very few choices to relax, the most common things they did is reading and playing some simple games.
8.0	But nowadays, as the technology develop so quick, people can choose to go for a movie, go to an amusement park full of entertainment facilities, and they can even go aboard travelling because the transportantion develop so fast, we can go everywhere we what.
8.0	So that can definitely improve the feeling of satisfy and keep people in a happy mood.
2.0	So, as the development of technology and economy, people have the access to improve their lives, and they no more need to worry about the lives as much as they used to.
7.0	The changing world has provided people with a wonderful world, all the things people have to do now is enjoying the better world and endeavor to make the world even better,
3.0	With the development of the gobalization, goverment would like to attract more tourists by using several strategies.
3.0	Recently, a heated debate has been aroused among people whether goverment should increase the safety by employing more police or not.
3.0	From my perspective, I firmly believe that the governemnt should enhance the security by employing more police.
3.0	Here are some reasons and examples supported my viewpoint.
5.0	First, hiring police would have a remarkable impact on country's reputation.
8.0	Tourists definitely love to visit a country where there is safe, so if some tourists visiting one country and experience a safe and joyful traveling here they would share their good experiences to other visitors, leading to more and more visitors coming for the country.
8.0	However, if one tourist suffer from an extreme dangerous situation when he travel a country, he would not forget his experience and claim that country as a bad place to the public.
8.0	For example, there was once a famous place that all the people love to have a visit.
8.0	But a series of serious cases such as robbing, rape, murdering happened in that places.
8.0	The government would not like to invest more money in this place and leaving few police here, so the severe cases kept happening, resulting in a bad reputation of the place that no one would dare to visit.
5.0	Second, more police would also help the local people and thus more active in economy.
8.0	Local people would benefit a lot from the addition of police and when they feel safe they can concentrate on their work and create more values to the society and country.
8.0	When the fortune accumulates, the society or country would become more and more flourish, attracting more visitors.
8.0	For example, there was a place that are well planed and exploited.
8.0	The government there enhance the local police and everyone invest their money for the local company because the company is well developed all the time.
8.0	Soon, the people in that place become rich and construct a lot of spetaular.
1.0	To put it into a nutshell, I hold the view that the government should enhance the safety by employing more police.
1.0	Because not only the reputatuion can be built but also the local economy can benefit.
12.0	I think is a good idea for parent to offer their children money as rewards for their high grade in scholl.
5.0	Firstly,children will be impressed by the hardship of making money through the way.
8.0	When I was in my primary shcool,my mom once told me that I could by awarded by money as long as I get full marks in math.
8.0	I was very happy them,because I could use the money to buy the toy dool I liked if I get it.
8.0	Encouraged by this,I start to study Math very hard.
8.0	I not only finish the exersice the teacher assigned for us,but also do many additional exercise by myself.
8.0	I spent many times working on Math,sometimes I even stay up until 10 pm!
8.0	And finally and effort paid off,I get my full mark in Math.
8.0	And I get 50 RMB  as my reward too.
8.0	I was deeply impressed by the difficulty I had overcome in order to earn the money,as a result of which,I learnt to save money from then on.
5.0	Secondly,it will give children a strong motivation to study.
8.0	Because those school-age children are too young too know that study are of great importance to their life.
8.0	And it always doesn't work just to teach them the importance of it.
8.0	So,the effective way to let them volunteer to study is to offer them money for their high grade in school.
8.0	Imagining that you are forced to learn those boring and difficlut classes when you want to play outdoors,isn't it suffering?
8.0	However,haven been told that you can get money in return as long as you work hark,you might are willing to study then.
2.0	In a word ,I think it is benificial for both parents and children to do this.
3.0	Nowadays, some parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.
12.0	From my opinion, that's quite not a wise way to encourage children.
6.0	In the first place, many children can't manage money well, and will even spend their money casually on something unnecessary.
8.0	Take myself for example, when I study at elementary school, I often bought some little things in shops outside school after class.
8.0	Secondly, if parents took this method to encourage thier children to study harder, the children would probably study for the money other than getting knowledge, which is rather an awful circumstance.
8.0	As you know, whatever we do, wo should have a right purpose, or we may not get something.
8.0	In additional, when parents always offer thier children money by this measure, children will be misled that gaining money is not that difficult.
8.0	Only if the children work by themselves, could they understand how tough it is to earn money, so that they may understand they should particularly value their money.
8.0	What's more, I hold the view that proper praise is needed for good work at school, whic
3.0	Nowadays, one controversial topic has aroused a heated debate around people: whether classmates or colleagues should communicate in person or through emails.
3.0	Opinions vary from person to person.
3.0	Some people argue that talking face to face helps students have an effective communication.
3.0	However, I hold the opposite view that sending email is a better way to communicate for students.
11.0	My point can be elaborated in follows.
5.0	First of all, communicating by sending email is more convenient for students.
8.0	People can send email to their classmate for asking questions about their project anytime when they suffer some problem and their classmate can also reply this email when they figure out this problem.
8.0	If they choose to talk about this pronblem face to face, they have to make appointment that they are all free and find a quite place, which is time-comsuming.
8.0	One research conducted by Wuhan University is a good case in point, in which the professors investigated two hundred students in Wuhan University aiming to find out which commnicate method do they prefer.
8.0	It turns out that seventy percent of students prefer to communicate with their classmate by email and thirty percent of them prefer communicating in person.
8.0	It is crytal clear that it is better for classmates to communicate through email.
5.0	Furthermore, Sending email helps students remember what they have talked, which is good for their project.
8.0	The email box can store what people have writen to others and what people have receieved.
8.0	In that case, if students forget how to solve a certain problem they have talked with, the email box can help them remember the solution.
8.0	However, if students talked about a problem in person, they can only organize another communication to talk about this problem again.
8.0	For example, I was assigned to do a programming last year.
8.0	After I wroten down the code in the C programming language, I cannot run this program because their is a bug in my program.
8.0	I sent an email to my classmate Tom for help and he reply the method of how to  debug a program immediately.
7.0	However, two months later, I forget how to debug a program again, but it is easu to me to check the email  box and learn the
3.0	As a saying goes, 'Parents are the best teachers of their children', we often expect parents to play an essential role in the development of a kid's habits and virtues.
3.0	But debates continue on how should parents educate their child.
11.0	For some parents, it will be better to teach their child hand in hand thus they will not encounter some troubles.
12.0	But I insist that parents should let children exprience making mistakes and then learn from it.
12.0	Here are my reasons.
4.0	Children have to realize that things are not always going so well but keep going wrong and is then recorrected.
8.0	If parents do not let children make mistakes, they will intend to consider whatever they do simple.
8.0	And that is not good for their growing up, for they will be easily beaten in their later years.
8.0	My nephew is an apple in his parents eyes, thus he was protected too carefully.
8.0	While he was learning to walk, his parents always followed him and astisted.
8.0	As a reslut, he never fell.
8.0	But once he was in my home, trying to walk without his parents protection, and he fell.
8.0	Crying as loudly as he could, he just sited on the cold hard floor instead of getting up himself.
8.0	He just didn't expect the danger he was facing.
8.0	We can see that, children could be braver if parents let them make mistakes.
4.0	As children growing up, they will be more confident to solve problems if parents do so.
8.0	It is from these experiences of making mistakes and trying again that children gain a confidence that 'I can do it if I make efforts'.
8.0	And they are more likely to presist in one thing.
8.0	Let me raise an example of my own.
8.0	When I was at primary school, my math was poor.
8.0	I always turn to my father for help, who was a doctor in engineering.
8.0	But from some day on, he did not answer my questions any more and I had to work them out myself.
8.0	I made many mistakes first that I almost gave up.
8.0	But I did it finally.
8.0	Since then, I had the confidence of solving math problems.
8.0	My father's letting me go really helped me.
4.0	Admittedly, children may deroute if keeping making mistakes.
8.0	And parents help is important.
8.0	But parents can let them make mistakes and then asist them solving the problem.
8.0	So there will be no worries about those problems.
2.0	I believe that children can benefit from making mistakes and solving them.
12.0	Many parents think the most important things for them is their children can get good grade， so they will think varies of ways to encourage their children to study, like offer money for each high grade if children get in school.
11.0	In my opinion, this ways is not good for children.
5.0	firstly, If parents always give money to their children when they get a good grade, children will depend on it.
8.0	If someday their parents did not give money to them, they will think it is unfair.
8.0	Take an example, my aunt think offer money is a good way to encourage her son, actually, her son has better and better grade.
8.0	However, once her son get a good grade but my aunt did not give money to him.
8.0	then her son very angry, and tell my aunt If she did not offer money, he will get a low grade in next exam.
5.0	secondly, It is easy to waste money if children do not know how to spend money.
2.0	like my little sister, she is very young so she can not manage money, she only know spend money on what she like.
9.0	therefore, she waste lots of money.
9.0	Also, if children have many mone,
3.0	I believe this is a very practical and simple method.
3.0	as an adult, we certainly understand that a good grade usually means a bright future.
3.0	but young people typically children may not notice the importance of grades.
12.0	sometimes simple sermons do not necessarily inspire children to yearn for good grades, but the proper reward can do so.
5.0	for example, when I was a young boy, my parents wouldn't give me a lot of pocket money, sometimes I could only buy a coke a day.
8.0	my classmates like to compare the amount of money they had, as a person who had the least pocket money, I often feel angry with my parents.
8.0	At the age of 13, my father finally realized the importance of pocket money for a child, but he refused to give me the money directly and simply.
8.0	He set up a goal for an exam.
8.0	when I get really high grades after a test, my reward is a sweet gift for me. as a poor person, the importance of such a reward is self-evident.
8.0	nothing is more pleasant tan conquering a challenge.
5.0	too much sermon is often bad for a child.
8.0	mother often preaches.
8.0	she usually lets me sit on the chair and listen to her long discourse, this kind of education is like a nightmare to me, and of course, I know she really wants me to be better, but I cannot agree with that way.
8.0	In my opinion, the rewards of money are no different from candy and food.
8.0	when reeducated infants and young children, parents often use sweets and kisses as effective incentives to change children's behavior.
8.0	later, when infants gradually become young people m candy and food may not useful.
8.0	then they should use some cash do the same job.
2.0	in this way, young people get the right reward, and parents do not need to worry about their kids' bad behaviors.
3.0	In nowadays, in order to inprove their ability to rate well to people many students choose to jion the clubs or take a part-time job in their life.
3.0	In my opions,I think that is very important for students to do these in the daily life.
11.0	There are some reasons to explian why I agree the ability to relate well to people is more important than studying hard in school.
5.0	Firstly,if you have a good ability to relate to people,you can have a good social skills to communicate whit each others.
8.0	For exanple,I have a  nice friend  Marry.
8.0	She joined a club when she in the university.
8.0	In the club, she meet many different people and she ofthen have a teamwork with them.
8.0	She knew how to deal with the problem in the communication and take friends whit different people.
8.0	So now , when we are adjust the work in the new place and try to slove many kinds of  problems by ourselves.
8.0	She has kewn the everyone in the business and  many of them are welling to help she when she had any problem.
8.0	Based on it ,I think a good ability to relate to people can help people in the work when they have any problems.
5.0	Secondly,althought the hard working in the school can help you get a good grades, That also a good conditon for the company to give you a nice job.
9.0	But if you don't know how to talk to others.
9.0	Sometimes,you may meet some unnecessary problems.
7.0	For example, my sister often feel u
12.0	Nowadays,many Chinese parents love their children so much that they shelter their children from everyting that may hurt their children.
11.0	As far as I am concrened,parents should let children try difficult things themselves and have them make mistakes.
11.0	In this way,children can learn from the mistakes and become wiser and stronger.
6.0	There are three reasons for my opinion.
8.0	First,the kids will face more and more difficulties as they grow up.
8.0	Parents can't protect them forever.
8.0	If parents overprotect their children,children will not be a man who can face anything bravely.
8.0	Second,making mistakes can make children more cautious and confident.
8.0	No one in the world can avoid making mistakes.
8.0	But those who make more mistakes are always more excellent.
8.0	Edison,a great inventor,has failed hundreds of times when he is inventing bulbs.
8.0	But finally,he made it on the basis that he had made many mistakes.
8.0	Third,children should be encouraged to solve problems.
8.0	If the parents always help children with thier questions,kids may become afraid of difficulties and give up themselves,which  absolutely does harm to the development of kids.
8.0	In such a cruel society,if we don't keep strengthen ourselves,we may live an unhappy life.
0.0	Mistakes are not always bad.
0.0	If we can adjust our attitude towards mistakes and try to learn from the mistakes,we may be a very learned person.
0.0	Children are the hope of most parents,I think those parents who prevent their children from making mistakes should change their ways to educate their children.
0.0	Appropriate educations are vital important to the children's life.
0.0	In a word,for children's future,parents should let it go and let the children learn from themselves.
3.0	Nowadays, many parents give their kids money as the award for getting high scores.
11.0	From my perspective, this is a very dangerous idea and may jeopardize the children's growth.
12.0	In the first place, most kids don't know how to use money correctly.
12.0	Since they still have not received enough education, for most time, kids don't know what is good and what is bad.
9.0	If parents just grant their children with money as long as they do well academically, those kids may spend money in ways that are unhealthy for their development, for example, buying video games, drinking alcohol and smoking.
9.0	Therefore, parents should not just give their kids money and allow them to spend it whatever they want, because children's growth does need scientific guidance.
5.0	Furthermore, giving money as the reward may mislead the children's world view.
9.0	In a child's early ages, what he really needs is love, and love can by no means be measured by money.
9.0	Use money to show the parents' love may make the kid's world view more materialistic, thus the kid is more likely to become a superficial person when he grows up, which is absolutely a tragedy.
5.0	Finally, besides giving money, there are so many ways that parents can adopt to award their beloved childen.
8.0	For example, after the kid gets improvement, the parents can travel with him, or buy a very valuable present.
8.0	Though such practices can also cost much money, what they mean is completely different from merely giving money.
8.0	The former is a way to show the parents' love and joy, while the latter may just seem a  trade.
8.0	By giving all kinds of meaningful presents, parents can get a much better result.
2.0	In conclusion, rewarding children money for academic improvement is by no means beneficial.
3.0	These days,some parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade when they get in school.
11.0	In my opinion,it is not a good idea for parents to encourage their children to get high grade in that way.
5.0	Admittedly,it can encourage children to get high mark in some ways.
8.0	But It tells children that you get high grade only for money rather than yourself.
8.0	We can't get money every time we finish some asignments greatly.
8.0	So it's important to teach children doing our best is what we need to do rather than for money.
5.0	Firstly,I think what children want is getting more and more expensive.
8.0	this time,you give them 10 dollars for a toy and maybe next time they want to get 50 dollars for computer games.
8.0	Offering them money for high grade will make them more and more greedy.
8.0	And if you can't satisfy them,then they won't make any effort for studying.
8.0	that's why I don't approve of this method.
8.0	For example,when I was in high shcool,my parents always gave me a gift if I get high mark in the exam.
8.0	At first,what I want is just a nice meal.
8.0	But generally what I want is changing all the time.
8.0	I want comic books,games,shoes and so on.
8.0	If I can't get a gift,I don't want to strive for high mark.
12.0	As far as I'm concerned, workers will be more satisfied when they have many different types of tasks to do than when they do similar tasks all day long.
4.0	First of all , doing similar tasks all day long ,as is known to all , will directly lead to workers' boringness.
9.0	Once if they get bored ,their moods will be impacted negatively ,let alone being satisfaied.
9.0	Thinking of typing forms in Excel all day long , I believe you could not stand the job like that, no matter how interesting or important the form is .
4.0	Second ,finishing tasks of the same type may make workers get the feeling of repeating.
9.0	Consequently , they might have mental suggestion like they are doing something useless.
9.0	Conversely , if a person often changes the typs of his/her works, he /she will think himself/herself finish a lot of tasks , and obtain more career satisfactory.
4.0	Thirdly, colorful tasks will arouse workers' enthusiasm of work ,with which , workers become more efficient in daily working .
10.0	The more theyhave done , formulating a positive circle of work.
3.0	The most difficult role in the world is probably to be a parent.
3.0	Because parents have to make money to support their families, they often hardly have enough time to spend with their children.
11.0	I think that if parents have time, they should play with their children or do some sports.
6.0	Playing games together allows parents to walk into the inner world of their children and listen to the deepest voice in their hearts.
8.0	Compared to the guardians and mentors, children always prefer companions who fight with them.
8.0	When a child wins a game or participates in a sport with his parents, it is easier fir the child to express his or her emotions in front of the parents without fear of parental blame.
8.0	Mom and Dad work side by side with their children to complete a task, so they can carefully analyze the child's current behavior according to their child's psychological activities which can help parents guide their children to go further and further on the road of life.
2.0	When parents play games with their children, they can more vividly teach something about the personality.
7.0	For instance, when parents are playing soccer with their children, it can be mre
3.0	Recently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people: which way will come up with the best solution to a problem, being creative or planning carefully?
3.0	Opinions vary from person to person.
3.0	Some people claim that being creative will come up with the best solution to a problem.
11.0	However, I would stand on their opposite side and I believe that planning carefully will do that.
12.0	My viewpoints can be elaborated as follows.
5.0	Firstly, planning carefully can make people consider things with a mature way.
8.0	People always feel worried and nervous when they are facing a trouble or problem.
8.0	Although they are very ceative and have original ideas, they could not come up with the best solution right away.
8.0	They would be easy to make mistakes and think carelesslly.
8.0	If one person do anything with a mind that he should plan carefully, he would find the best way to sovle the problem.
8.0	Because he has patience to plan and it can make him to avoid the bad solution and choose the best one.
8.0	For example, my sister was a very careful person and she had a time scheduel about every day.
8.0	Last week, she had a time conflict between the school party and the history class.
8.0	She planned carefully and attend to the party after the class because study was more important for her.
5.0	Secondly, planing carefully can make the solution much safer.
8.0	careful mind can reduce the risk of making the wrong decision.
8.0	At many times, people cannot come up with the best way just by the creative thinking, because there are no guarantee that this creative thinking can success.
8.0	For example, My classmate attend to a science contest and their group wanted to use the new and creative technique.
8.0	However, their strategy failed because they ignored the defect of this creative technique.
2.0	All in all, I firmly think that planning carfully will come up with the best solution to a problem.
3.0	As our economy increase, more and more parents are able to offer money to their school-age children for reward.
11.0	But some other parents worry about whether this can cause negtive effect on their kid.
11.0	However, in my point of view, I think it is a good idea worth trying.
4.0	For basic reason, giving money for children when they gat good grade is an effective way for encouraging.
8.0	Imaging when your children get a high grade in the final exam.
8.0	What are you going to do to keep this right tendency?
8.0	Generally most parents would like to find a way to keep this state.
8.0	So money is a good tool.
4.0	Furthermore, this is also good for their study.
8.0	Because most of children can understand the importance of keeping good grade, using a way of forcing is sometimes necessary.
8.0	When your children go to college, they will feel much better than others.
8.0	I am sure most parents would like to see a better future of our own kid.
4.0	For the most important reason, this is a way telling children that only hard working can get repay.
9.0	Setting correct value is very critical in a child's growing.
9.0	Only spending your time and working hard can lead the result of success.
0.0	In this way, it is much easier to teach children valuable lesson to some extend.
0.0	Although some parents may think offering children money may hurt themselvese if they have not used it properly.
0.0	But I think this is also a change for children growing instead.
0.0	There is always a day you children have to live on their own.
0.0	So it worth having a try.
3.0	People always admire some celebrities, some even go so far as to regard their words as the authorities and make those their mottos.
3.0	But people at different ages sometimes judge those opinions differently.
11.0	Some people say that the opinions of the celebrities are more important to  younger people than they are to older people, however, I just see it in a opposite way.
12.0	I thinks that the importance are equal to old and young, even sometimes those words may play a more important role in aged people's life.
5.0	To begin with, young people need to explore the world in their own ways, it's not always good and appropriate for them to listen to famous people's advices and follow them simply.
8.0	Young people, who have a lot of energy and a buntch of time, should always follow their own ideas and think in independently.
8.0	Famous people's opinions do have some good aspects, but everyone should explore their own ways to success instead of copying others.
8.0	One of my roommates admired an idol so much that she soon became a cult fan of him.
8.0	She even wants to make her ways to a singer too.
8.0	But she just didn't fit the job.
8.0	Copying the idol's way didn't work for her, and because of her indulging in that, she got a worst grades ever.
8.0	Celebrities some times can encourage people, but since young people do not mature enough and not rational enough, sometimes following celebrities without thinking ruins their lives.
5.0	On another side, old people need the encouragement  from the celebrities to refresh themselves and be positive to live again.
8.0	Older people have more burden than the younger one, so they need a way to relax and to entertain them as well as give them the energy to live again.
8.0	In addition, older people are sensible and rational, they have a strong mind to tell the right from the wrong.
8.0	As a result, thay have ability to pick the right advice for themselves without being distracted from the normal life.
1.0	To sum up, we should always tell the essence from the phenomenon.
1.0	We can't just dump into the conclusion that the opinions of celebrities are more important for younger people than they are to older people because old people are more likely to control themselves and be benefited from the celebrities.
3.0	Things have changed a lot during the past fifty years, many people starts to wonder that the advice given by our grandparents is still useful.
3.0	Some finds that the advice out of context; while others believes the wisdom of their grandparents.
12.0	Personaliy, i still find that the advice given by my grandmother useful.
5.0	First, we have to admitt that things have changed, but there are things which share the same principle.
8.0	Thus, the advice we get from the old are still functionable.
8.0	My grandmoter always tells me about what I should do when making friend.
8.0	Using making friedns for example, we no longer need to worry about not be able to get in touch with our friends, but keep in regular corresponse with your friends is crucial of maintaining your friendships with them; or we do not have to concer about only have small group of friends  in our whole life, social media makes friend making easily, but we still need to be sincere when we want to star a new friendship.
5.0	My grand mother also often teaches me things about how to behavor in public place, within more chance to engage with others in public area, I find her advice to be more than useful.
9.0	She once warned me not to eat smelly snacks in bus when I was four years old, Iwas puzzled by her anger.
9.0	I realized how awful things i did when i was four for not concerning other peoples feelings, As a 20 years adult, She tells me to always take other peoples feelings in to account when it concers other people.
2.0	Some advice may not be as useful as it was fifty years ago, but there are many advice I still use in my daily life.
10.0	Not only the way of how to treats people taught by my grandmother, but also tips about cooking  in her cooking books.
3.0	Nowadays, although the Internet seems to be bringing people much closer then before, the actual connection between people seem to have become further then it once was.
12.0	When facing struggling strangers, more and more people choose to mind their own business and walk away.
4.0	The main reason that accounts for this situation is that trust between people is more unlikely to acquire than before.
8.0	When ever someone sees an elderly person falls down in the middle of the road, the first thing that comes to his mind is not rushing over to help.
8.0	"He would first ask himself, ""Did that man fall down on purpose?"
8.0	Would he ask me for money if I go over to help him?
8.0	"Would I be held responsible even if I was there to help?"""
8.0	With so many questions asked, one might just decide that it would be better to pretend nothing's wrong and walk away.
4.0	Secondly, people nowadays have a much faster lifestyle than before.
9.0	Everyone has a lot of 'his own business' to mind, thus leaving them no time for others' problems.
9.0	Suppose that one has already been exhausted after a day's work, it wouldn't be very unreasonable if he just doesn't want to help a stranger with his heavy luggage.
4.0	Last but not least, people nowadays care more about what others think.
9.0	When one sees that other people choose to look away, he would feel stupid to step forward.
9.0	Therefore, one would think that he might as well walk away too.
1.0	To sum up, I think that people today are less willing to help the struggling strangers, because they fear that they would be deceived or hurt.
1.0	They are busy, tired, and unwilling to be different from others, which is why they are always waiting for others to step forward first.
3.0	Are you into having multitude of tasks to do or just doing similar tasks all day long?
3.0	In other words, are you fond of stable schedule or abundant lifestyle?
3.0	With the development of economic globalization and technology, people nowadays can do a variety of works by just staying at their office.
3.0	But due to the different types of jobs, people have diverse content and style of work.
12.0	I totally support that I prefer that I have diversity of different types of tasks to do during the workday because the feeling of freshness and the satisfaction of solving challenges.
5.0	On the one hand, there is no doubt that some people want to have a stable work schedule everyday.
8.0	There are multitude of reasons that some people hold this kind of view.
8.0	Firstly, they do not like to change more about their life, doing the similar tasks all day long can maintain their lifestyle.
8.0	Besides, people who want to have similar tasks in working field is the people who hold the characteristics that not very outgoing and introverted.
8.0	They just follow the rules made by the managers or the administrators, in other words, I think those people are into the things that others impose on them, like a robot.
5.0	On the other hand, when talking about the reason why I am fond of having many different types of tasks, I think the most significant reason is that I want to gain the feeling of freshness everyday.
8.0	There is an instance, when you give a new stuffed-toy  to a kid, they may abandon the toy that the hand in their hand at that time.
8.0	So if children have the feeling of freshness, the adults have this kind of feeling as well.
8.0	In addition, the satisfaction of solving challenges is very essential for me.
8.0	People always feel nervous and exhausted when they are facing challenges, but if we solve this issue successfully, we will gain more than we thought before.
1.0	In conclusion, although different individuals would have diversity of opinions, I still hold the view that I need different things happened everyday in my working field.
1.0	Even though facing some unpredictable issues is very complicated and difficult or coping with a large number of things is very exhuasted, I can gain more experience instead of sticking to convention.
3.0	I don’t think it was a good idea for those parent who offer their school-age children money for each high grade.
11.0	There are few reasons I have found.
5.0	Firstly,this is not beneficial for  the development of the value concept of those children and may even lead them to get high grade only for money but not for knowledge.
9.0	Tests and exams are just measures to check what childrens have learn and get a result of their study conditions,but of course not ways to earn money.
9.0	If this method of encouraging childrens' study is still used ,the children won't be able to figure out the difference between work and study.
5.0	secondly,this method may lead to cheat in exams.
9.0	For exemple ,a student who always performs terrible in his school work once get a promise from his parents of offering money for high grade,he may cheat just for the money .
9.0	All above may harm to both the parent and the child.
3.0	Nowadays more and more people have longer and longer working time.
11.0	They will be exhaust after working such a long time.
8.0	And you will find that if they have chances to choose works,they will choose mulipute works.
8.0	There is no doubt that workers will be happier to have different types of tasks than single works.
8.0	And the reasons will be listed in the following passages.
4.0	Wokring on similar tasks all day long is quite boring.
8.0	Workers just repeat what they can do again and again.
8.0	They just work on the same place, meet silmilar people, do silmilar things and even say similar words everyday.
8.0	Although it's their job, they can't find joy during working and they can't learn more through working.
8.0	It will makes them feel hopeless for the ending and future.
4.0	On the contrast, if they have different types of tasks to do ,they will have more passions to work.
8.0	Because in that working conditions, they may meet different peopel during working which means maybe something different and surprised may happen.
8.0	It will make they have desires to work and know what will happen next.
8.0	In that case, it will help them keep moving and urge them finish their work.
4.0	In addation, they can get new working skills when working on different things.
8.0	Because having different works also means different problems may happen during working.
8.0	They need to solve problems in different occasions and look for or create a better way to work on it.
8.0	What's more, they may need to improve themselves for the job, such as learning how to make up for a meeting.
8.0	It will increase the pleasure iin the work.
8.0	So workers will have more interests to finish the work.
8.0	And maybe it wil help them improve working efficency.
1.0	All in all, workers will be more joyful if they have different kinds of working tasks, no matter for the pleasure or the experience and knowledge.
1.0	So it's a good suggestion for leaders to assign different tasks for a worker to enhace his working efficency and working passions.
3.0	"""Do just one thing or some things"" , this is a question."
3.0	If one person should just do one thing for all day long or can chose seaveal satisfing tasks to do?
11.0	I agree the idea the employee will get more satisfied when having different types of work than when only do similar job for a long time.
4.0	What do we call which only do one thing one and one more?
8.0	Machine, The workers are human, which are different from other animals because of our mood.
8.0	We can feel and think about ourselves.
8.0	Although the machine can do this thing better contributed by the large experience, they just can do but do not know think.
8.0	If we just do one thing, we can not creat the superior machine,so as the company.
4.0	What's more, achievement will be put on the workers if they do many kinds of tasks.
8.0	Take the teacher fo example.
8.0	The thing that she is ordered to is teaching.
8.0	She just need to teach what she need to,but does it worth?
8.0	A good teacher can not only teach, but also be concerned about her students.
8.0	The sound from the student is the best gift to the teacher.
8.0	There isn't any thing can replace the satisfaction that made by the students.
8.0	Through the communication, the teacher can achieve herself and the student can make friends with the teachers.
4.0	Last but no least, more types can be more choices for us.
9.0	A fantastic man can do different kinds of things and have more chances.
9.0	Once you don't like to do this, you can chose anthor one.
2.0	So I insist my oppion.
11.0	From my perspective,I think it is not a good idea to offer the school-age children some money for each high grade they get in school.
11.0	First of all,I think study is deeply related to one's interest.
8.0	If someone don't have enough interest to learn some subject,it may lead to his low efficiency.
8.0	In other words,he can not get enough motivation to learn.
8.0	There is nearly no doubt that if parent use the money to stimulate the children,they will learn much harder in order to get higher grade.
8.0	But this may disobey the original aim of study and the children may think the study is just aimed to get some money.
8.0	So,I don't think it is a good idea for parent to take.
5.0	What's more,if the parent always give children some money as the prize for their high mark,the children will be extremely sad when he failed to get high mark after several times to get high mark.
9.0	In this time,some children may be fed up with study.
9.0	Actually,this phenomenon is that one all of the parents don't would like to see.
5.0	At last,this behaviour accustome the childdren to study for money.
10.0	In the future,though they meet the subject they may be interestde in,they can not devote themselves to the study without some stimulation such as money.
0.0	Pesonlly speaking,my parents has used this method to encourage me to study harder.
0.0	Then,I studied very hard because I desired to get the money.
0.0	It goes wiyhout saying that I got higher mark after that.
8.0	Initially,I thought it is really a good idea to improve my idea.
8.0	But,when I became older,I realized that I just got a little knowledge in my mind.
8.0	Besides,after my parent decided not to give me money as an encouragement,I lost the motivation to study,I bagan to hate studying.
3.0	As is known to all of us.
3.0	leadship plays an essential role in group working.
3.0	Due to the leadership,the team can find a way to march on.
3.0	Due the leadership,the team can have courage to face the challenge.
3.0	Due to the leadership,the team can embrace a brigther future.
11.0	However,when it comes to leadership,there is a question needs to be discussed.
8.0	The question is whether leadership comes naturally or people can learn to be a leader.
8.0	From where I stand,I firmly hold the belief that people can learn to be a leader.
8.0	The reasons why I hold that perspective are as follow.
4.0	Everthing can be learnt.
8.0	including leadership.
8.0	If one can not be a qualified leader,it is because that there is something they can improve.
8.0	So,he can learn from others,from experience to improve himself,to make himself to be better man.
8.0	When all of the qualification is satisfied,he can be a professional leader,either.
8.0	Taking Mao Zedong as an example to illustrate what I am demonstrate above.
8.0	Mao was born in a rural village and his family was very poor.
8.0	In that period,the government loaded a lot of pressure and burden on ordinary people‘s shoulder.
8.0	So,he wanted to changed this situation and readed a lot of book.
8.0	He studied a lot to know how to lead a revolution to improve people's situation.
8.0	And finally,after studing and learning,he accomplished the revolution.
4.0	And second reason is that people need to fight for who they want to be and what they want to do.
8.0	Becoming a leader also needs people to pursue and chase.
8.0	If one person want to be a leader,he can make his efforts.
8.0	When these endeavors are seen and appreciated by the others,he will be a leader.
8.0	For instance,when I was in college,I participated in a club.
8.0	And one day the team came up with a advice that the club needed a chairman.
8.0	In my inner thought,I wanted to be this man.
8.0	However,I stepped back.
8.0	There was another people stand forward to apply for this position and he listed all the thing he had done for this club.
8.0	Then,he won the position.
4.0	Some people may hold the opinion that when thing proccess into a particular stage,the leader will emerge.
9.0	However,although this man show up,we can not deny the fact that he has improved himself and fight for this position.
9.0	In this way,this reason can not make any sense.
1.0	From what I have been referred above,we can come down to following: leadership can be pursed and be learnt.
1.0	If people want to be a leader, they need to take antions right now.
3.0	The issue of how parents spend their spare time with children is a highly debatable one.
3.0	Some people hold the viem that parents should have fun playing games with their children while others believe doing things related to schoolwork is a better choice.
3.0	Although it's always wise to help children with their study, I strongly convinced that having fun with children has more advantages because it can contribute to their relationships and let parents have a better understanding of their children.
4.0	Firstly, having fun playing games is a great chance for parents to gain a close relationship with their children.
10.0	During the process of playing with them, both the parents and the children can experience the happiness of doing things together.
4.0	It can also create priceless memories which deserve to be valued forever.
8.0	My uncle's work is busy in the weekdays and he always return home late.
8.0	So he don't have much time to stay with his son on weekdays in this conditions.
8.0	But he usually paly basketball with his son on weekends and that contribute to their relationship a lot.
4.0	Moreover, having fun with their children can help parents understand their children better.
8.0	Owing to lack of time staying with their children, parents may not know what their children think.
8.0	But when they choose to play with their kids, they are bound to have plenty of chances to communicate with the kids.
8.0	During these communications, both of them can know each others better.
8.0	I will still use my uncle for an example, he get informed about a lot of informations about his kid's school life, which is really useful.
0.0	Although spend time doing the things related to schoolwork can help with children's study, the benefit of this kind of choice is little on account of the lack of time.
0.0	Studying is a long period which needs to be repeated everyday.
0.0	Under this circumstances, spending the deficient time on study are more likely to get out of perspective.
3.0	The problem of education is important from one person's growth to development of a society.
11.0	So we should pay more attaintion on education.
11.0	It is beneficial to our progress.
11.0	But should we focus on early stage or late training to educate.
11.0	I prefer to teach people on early stage is more important than late period.
11.0	So I agree with the opinion that spend money on the education of little children is more important than universities.
5.0	Firstly, I think the development of one person's qualities is formed when they are young.
8.0	For example, a child have not get any punish if they do something wrong, such as cheat in a exam, stole a bread and so on.
8.0	They will not realise these behaviors are bad, and they continue to do these as usual.
8.0	Finally when they grow up they will make more serious crime from the little bad behaviors.
8.0	So I think correct their mistake and educate them when people are young children is important.
5.0	Secondly, to educate young children can give them a well basic on their future.
7.0	A good habit of learning is beneficial to the
12.0	It is my opinion that people in such a modern era are less willing to help the struggling strangers in reality but relatively opposite on web.
12.0	First,it's a fast-setp society that we live in so that most adults cannot save time to give a help hand to the strangers aside us,but if the site is happened on the website,the situation will be totally different.
10.0	For example,there are many news that some old fell aside the street without no passerby's help and attention only the photo taking,while a simple helping demand declared on the website without real information about that news can draw much attention.
6.0	Then,it is the society's complexity that result in the phenomenon.
8.0	For instance,there used to be a girl who helping a old in turn being robbered.
8.0	Such a incident increase the worry about helping the one in need as the amount of such poeple making use of the symphathy  Last but not the least,mobile phone is used wiedly in 21 century and its characteristic may also play a role in such phenomenon in our society.
8.0	Everyone pay a close attention on mobile phone which provide a great platform to being informed the world we are not familiared with.
8.0	In my opinion,the expanding use of mobile phone is indeed a great push in the charity careers,but we also cannot ignore the one aside us in need and being addicted to the phone.
1.0	The most important thing is that developing a bright eyes to distinguish the information's truth or false brightly.
1.0	Hence ,that's all my opinions towards the society and our phschology that supporting my attitude about the phenomenon.
10.0	Team works better
3.0	There's no same leaves in this world,and so we are.
12.0	Everyone in this world has different gifts,which means that we all have advantages and shortcomings,but by working together,we can go further than we go alone.
4.0	Just imagine you're going to do a science project and then represent it to the class.
4.0	First of all,you 've more people in your group,which gives you the opportunity to complete a bigger project.
10.0	And a bigger project usually expand your horizon and may expose you to more information.
4.0	Second,you can do a brainstorm.
9.0	More brains means muliple ideas and creations,and basically you can't enjoy that when you are alone.
9.0	It will be a great fortune to you as you gain several times amount of opions and knowledge.
4.0	Third,as you're working in a group,you are tend to take your own responsibilities,otherwise you'll be guilty when you can't accomplish your job when others can.
10.0	This does motivate you to work harder,in other words,you learn harder and can be more professional and familiar with your part of job.
4.0	Fourth,when examine your work together,a good knowledge of other parts of this project is crucial.
8.0	So after finishing your own part of the project,you need to learn other things.
8.0	So the borders are crushed,you gain far more knowledge than you thought.
8.0	Also,as other people might comment on your work,you might get much better understanding of the project.
8.0	The group mission not only expand your horizon but also increase the depth of your understanding.
4.0	Finally,you need to represent.
9.0	How to express yourself is an art.
9.0	So you need to package yourself better and that will teach you something.
10.0	All in all, the group work can surely be more effective inlearning in stud
3.0	Nowsday, telling the truth bacome more and more unimportant, people pay more attention to the gain money and save time.
11.0	But in my opinion I think telling the truth is very important to us, ecspecilly, in the relationship between people.
12.0	Because telling the truth could give other the right lead and can prevent a good impression to others.
12.0	All of this is good for us and our friends.
5.0	However, always tell the truth to other is very rigid and it does not have benefit to the relationship between people.
8.0	For example, if you girlfriend ask you that she is beauty or not in the new shirt, and she want you give a good answer.
8.0	In this time,maybe you think she does not look very beautiful in this shirt, but if you ask the truth, your pretty girl will unhappy.
8.0	It is no good for the relationship between you and your girlfriend.
8.0	However, if  you tell the truth and tell she that she is not suit in this shirt and give her some advice.
8.0	She may think you are very sincere.
5.0	Firstly, tell the truth could help other to solve the problem that they have made rather than let it continue to develop.
8.0	For instance, once my best friend failed in his major subject math.
8.0	He was very hungery and complain to me again and again.
8.0	He complain the paper, the pencil, even though the bad weather.
8.0	However i know the problem he had, he always stay up very late and slept in the next day class and the assignment of the professor he always write them finally.
8.0	Base on this, I told him the biggest problem is youeself.
8.0	He became more angry than before.
7.0	But several day later, he called
3.0	As for the idea about parents accord their children's grade to offer their own money.
11.0	In my opinion, I think it is not a appropriate way.
4.0	First of all, children are pure angles and their efforts should not be measured by money.
8.0	Parents should not instil money in their children from childhood.
8.0	In doin so, it is possible for children to learn and learn to sake of money.
8.0	And it is right for everyone to study hard for their own future.
4.0	Then, children's learning attitude should be formed from childhood.
8.0	And if parents do the things, when somedays they do not give their kids money.
8.0	The kids may not study hard as ever before.
8.0	Therefore, the monetary reward is to draw the lily.
4.0	Last but not least, parents shouldn't get into the habit of children from high cost, this is an era full of temptation.
8.0	If a child who done his/her work very well, as described above, the parents will give a large number of money to their kids, so do you think they will study hard with a lot of money?
8.0	If they use the money to buy a phone or a computer, I don't think they will do well as before.
8.0	On the contrary, if a child does not perform well, parents will give them a little money, however, the kids will not have enough money to buy whatever they like.
8.0	The phenomenon of campus comparison is becoming more and more serious, so it is a wise chioce to give children money quantitatively.
0.0	As what has been discussed above, I think it is bad for the kids to accord their grade to offer the money in their daily life.
0.0	Althongh it may has some advantages.
0.0	But for me, I think it has more disadvantages then to do it.
3.0	recently, the issuue of whether the internet provide people with a lot of valueable informations has gained much debate.
3.0	some people support this idea while others think this kind of access to so much informations cause many problems.
11.0	from my point of view, i regard the information on the internat bring us more benefits than harmness.
6.0	first and foremost, without the information on the internet, people will suffer a difficult and long time in  liberary to get the information they need.
8.0	as we all living in a information exploSion age, we need get as many informations as we can in the shortest time to get our work better done.
8.0	like, if we want to write a thesis oon history,.
8.0	in the past , we have defenitely go to a libarary to check on all kinds of history books, but we may still not get the information we need.
8.0	however, nowadays ,wo only have to input the keyword on the computer, then we will get all the information we want only by clicking the mouse what's more, the internet is the quickest way to get information.
8.0	for examples, my friend may, who is a     investor, gains money in the stock.
8.0	the reason for her to invest in a stock is to anlalyse the revenue of ca comany.
8.0	so she has to check on the internet  all the time to know wether she has gained money, and if the trend is not going like it bofore she would make quick decisions to sell the stock.
0.0	while, we all know that knowing some unnecessary informations in the wrong stage of our live may cause problems like, children fall in love with each other in a ealier age, and some people are becoming more complicated with taking too much considerations.
0.0	but,the more we know, the maturer we will be.
0.0	as we all livng in a fast pace, society, so if the internet can provide us with faster and more specific information, we should take fully advantage of it.
11.0	Nowadays, with fast development of society, young generations seem do better in their life choices, but a group of people think that young people today are actually not able to make better dicision about their own lives than young people in the past.
11.0	Personally, I strongly believe that today young people are better able to make divisions about their own lives.
5.0	To begin with, young people nowadays have plenty of reliable resources help them to make fair dicision.
8.0	In the past, communication had many limitations so that young people could only turn to their parents or relatives for suggestions to help them make better dicision, and sometimes parents cannot give right ideas.
8.0	But now people have lots of ways to communicate so they could consult professionals for help or they could just learn relevent stuff from Internet to help them make better dicisions.
8.0	For instance, my friend want to buy a game computer but don't know which sort is best fit his requirment.
8.0	His parents know nothing about computer so he ask professional people on the Internet and learn what kind he wants.
8.0	In this case, young people don't need to depend on their parents to make decisions because they already had a better way to assistant them so they are better able to make decision about their own lives.
5.0	Secondly, young people today are more independent to the past and the society is also more opened.
9.0	In the past, it seems to be a tradition that parents should consider and make dicision for their children and this tradition existed for quite a long time, but now is quite different because young people today are no longer need to follow this old fashion and are progressed to make their own dicision.
9.0	In this circumstance, young people can make decision freely and practice making sicision, with practicing, they could make dicisions better.
2.0	To put into a nutshell, because of the development of technology and change of society, today young people are better able to make decisions about their own lives.
3.0	Nowadays, parents are being more and more busy with their own work, leaving much less time to spend with their children.
3.0	But I believe parents are still willing to spend time with their children.
3.0	When it comes to the choice that whether to spend the small amount of time on having fun playing games or sports with children or on schoolworok, I prefer the former one.
3.0	There are three reasons why I take the chioce: children may have been really tired after a whole day's studying at school, parents' attending at schoolwork will increse children's pressure and playing games will help children keep energetic and fit.
4.0	First, after a whole day's listening and working with their study at school, children must have been tired enough.
8.0	Therefore, they must have be unwilling to spend more time on homework at home, which gives them no time to relax.
8.0	What they would like to do is just to take some time to have some fun, for example, playing games or sports.
8.0	Moreover, with parents' accompany, they may have much more joy, and also they can share the happiness with their own parents.
4.0	In addition, with parents' focusing on children's homework at home, children may feel uncomfortable and get stressed.
8.0	No matter what they write down or speak, the parents will point out their mistakes and let them revise, which not only discourage the children's to keep on doing their homework, but also interrupt their thinking.
8.0	I still remember that when I was young, I had my father staying with me, watching me finishing my math homework.
8.0	I was very stressed and scared if I had write something wrong, with his severe eyesights focusing on me and my textbooks.
8.0	Inevitablely, I really made a mistake.
8.0	Although he helped me revise the answer, I still felt  uncomfortable and did not understand why they parents always keeping their minds on our schoolwork.
8.0	That is why I prefer parents should spend the time having fun with children.
4.0	In the end, having fun such as playing gamed and aports will help children keep energetic and fit.
9.0	Still, after a whole day's study, children may be tired of schoolwork and without energy.
9.0	Thus, playing some games or sports, for example, playing some computer games and playing football or basketballs will let them recover from the unhealthy condition and be energetic again.
1.0	For these reasons, I prefer speding time having more fun with children.
1.0	In this way, not only children will get relaed bu also parent wiil
11.0	It is becoming more and more popular to work together in our international society.
12.0	Although students will concerntrate more  when they are working alone, I hold the viewpoint that working together is a better way for students to get effective study.
4.0	Generally speaking, working together can save more time which students can spend on more important activities.
8.0	If students are working alone, they will take more time to get all the frames of that projects and to complete the whole works.
8.0	In the contrast, when they are working together, they can discuss together and make the works partly so that every student in the group only need to do appropirate number of works.
8.0	Once the students get their own parts to finish, the aim would be more clear and each of the students can concentrate more attention on the work they need to do.
4.0	What's more, even though the group working might produce more peer pressure, the students can be motivated by other excellent peers.
8.0	There is a saying that the pressure is the source of the motivation.
8.0	When a student is surrounded by many greater students, he or she may get much more ambious to be excellent.
8.0	Take myself as the example, it's when I was in high school.
8.0	I transferred to the other better science class when  the school delivered all the students to different classes.
8.0	In that class, I got touched with some higher-grade students, and I began to think why he was greater than me.
8.0	I tried my best to learn from him and always asked him questions.
8.0	Eventually, I won the first price in one exam, I got a large sense of achievement and I was sure that I improved much.
8.0	Therefore, it's great to have someone to motivate each other.
4.0	In addition, when we discuss with others, we can get lots of different perspectives about that project, which may make students learn more from that project.
9.0	When different students show their own opinions on the topic and the argued with others trying to persuade them, they will find their own errors during that period.
9.0	Acctually, thinking one topic from different aspects is a great way to learn, which is useful in many situations of our daily life not only in learning.
1.0	As far as I'm concerned, we cannot emphasize the importance of group working too much.
1.0	Only when we learn from others or learn with others, can we improve much more.
12.0	I think it is a good idea, but sometimes its not, this problem in the social have long time ago, a lot of people talk about this so many times, but today this problem also won't be solve, let me talk about this.
5.0	Before this idea is creater for hard study school age children can get achievenment in the same age student.
8.0	and also will give them some reward for them hard studying.
8.0	and some do not get reward children will see the reward its great, the achievenment is great, it can get pride.
8.0	So that's why before adult and social  create this idea.
8.0	"But for now, the kids will not just see it for get pride, since for now when the school age children don't get the reward or do not have the praised in this school, everbody will know it, everybody know you don't get high grade in this semester, even somebody will laugh you, the kids parents will said"" i'm very disappointed with you."""
8.0	So if you don't get the high grade, you even don't have pride.
8.0	Before the kids wanna get the reward in the rewards table just want get achievenment and pride.
8.0	"But for now the kids wanna the ""pride back""."
5.0	Sometimes the low grade student cause this give up to hard study.
9.0	And even some of them give up back to school.
9.0	So it's the huge problem for this idea.
0.0	I have a suggest for this problem, that is when the school will doing the rewards stuff, just call the student to the consuler office or student service to get reward for have high grade students.
0.0	And don't tell anyone who get the reward or who do not get the reward.
0.0	it will let all the student think they are same.
0.0	Don't will have the pride or don't have pride difference.
0.0	So i think it is the way to solve this problem, it will good for the student environment and development, also it good for the future education.
3.0	Have you got pocket money from your parents when you was a child?
3.0	Have you managed how to spent them?
3.0	When I was a child, I always got pocket money from my mother.
3.0	And she asked me to write down every expenditure clearly on my diary.
3.0	Thanks for her requirement, I built up a good habit that makes me know where my money go.
11.0	Hence I think if children want to become financially responsible adults, they need learn to manage their money at a young age.
10.0	There are two specific facets why I think in this way.
5.0	Initially, as financially responsible adults, people shoud know where their money go and avoid spending money on the thing they do not need.
8.0	I think that write down every expenditure can help.
8.0	For instance, when I was five, I got my first pocket money.
8.0	At that time my mother asked me to write down my expenditure on my diary and she would check it every month.
8.0	Now once when I spend money, I will record it on my phone.
8.0	After a month, I will check it myself.
8.0	Sometimes I find that I spend much money on things that I do not really need.
8.0	At the same time, I would reflect myself and avoid by those articles.
8.0	Hence, I save more money and figure out where my money go.
5.0	Moreover, people need to the value of money when they are at a young age.
8.0	Most of children get money  from their parents firstly, because they cannot make money themselves.
8.0	However, children who do not manage their money will mostly be able to spend money faster than children who do manage their children.
8.0	For example, my little cousin do not manage his pocket money.
8.0	When he run out all his money, he asks his parents for money.
8.0	After a month, he spent
2.0	Taking account of all the factors mentioned above, we can safely arrive the conclusion that if children want to become financially responsible adults, they should learn to manage their own money at a young age.
3.0	Nowadays, telexision advertising that we can see it in our watching time.
3.0	Some people think television advertising should allow to young children, but some people claims television advertising should not be allow.
11.0	Personally, I believe that television advertising should be allow to young children,because they can learn some knowledge in television advertisment.
6.0	To begin with,I think television advertismen should be allow to young children,because advertisment can let young children look their design.
9.0	For example, the kids look design of bowl,they will determine which design they think pretty, they will compare it.
9.0	When they look a lot, their mind will chose the pretty one is.
7.0	Secodly, I think television advertisment should be allow to young children, because
12.0	I think it has some advantages anyway.
11.0	To be specific,this method can give children a strong desire to learn,at least in a short term.
11.0	So they can behave better in school,get better marks,learn more knowledge carefully.
11.0	And children can get more money,which they can use to develop their hobbies.
12.0	This may have the children a good idea about money.
6.0	However,this method do more harm than good.
8.0	A school-age child is on his developing stage.
8.0	If a child is taught in this way,he cannot get the meaning of learning,or worse,he would think he learns for his parents,for money.
8.0	He may be crazy for money when he grows up.
8.0	This is a dangerous thought,which may lead the child to a terrible way.
8.0	If this really happens,we did a terrible thing to the child.
8.0	Learning's meaning is learning itself.
8.0	This is the right motivation for a child to learn.
8.0	Only if a child can get this,he can learn carefully for a long time,even for his whole life.
8.0	The education,however,isn't about marks,even not about knowledge.
8.0	It's about to make a children to develop,to be better.
8.0	This education method is against the goal of education,which makes it a totally failed method.
0.0	In my opinion,children should be taught the meaning of learn first,be leading to the right way first.
0.0	After this,children can set a right goal and move forward in the right way automously.
0.0	This way,not only money is saved,but also children will have a healthier thought,have a brighter future.
0.0	To make children have a great thought,this is the real meaning of eduction,is it?
12.0	I think some parents offer theie school-age children money for each high grade they get in school this is a good idea.
12.0	child are children ,they need to be envouraged,if they have ,they will get more and more best score in the future.
6.0	firest,confident is a improtant thing that a growing children.
8.0	for example,since my childhood,i have many souse of confident.
8.0	such as,my mother alway encourage me to standing in the stage,to show how can i do.
8.0	this thing give me many confident.
10.0	second,
11.0	When we grow up, from an adolescent to an elite, it is thanks to teachers that we have a board horizon and be proficient in our field.
12.0	Currently, some teachers would like to share the social and political views known to students during the class.
11.0	This behavior may help students to enlarge their knowledge sometimes, but there are several problems with it.
11.0	As for me, I am not favor of it.
6.0	To begin with, to led students accept the social and political views which have been concluded passively will hinder the capability of individual thinking of students.
8.0	After such a long-term teaching method, we may maintain that as long as we learn this conclusion from teachers, we could finish our assignment and perform well on the final exam.
8.0	However, it is true that we can get a few sense of achievement when we got high scale; however, can it simplify to say we have processed the ability to analyze problems?
8.0	I guess not.
8.0	My brother, Lin is a case in this point.
8.0	He is the most excellent student in his class all the time whenever in the primary school or in college.
8.0	As taking elaborate notes and can remember what teachers said in classes, he can complete exams without extra thinking.
8.0	However, when he works, it becomes a nightmare because of the study habit.
8.0	He could not come up with his own original ideas during discussions.
8.0	Accordingly, he was dismissed.
8.0	To gain a lesson from his experience, students should not be given the known view directly by teachers, which makes more trouble in the students' future.
0.0	On top of that, in the information explosion era, there are plenty of approaches for students to search online.
0.0	Unlike a decade ago, the single way to acquire knowledge is listening to teachers.
0.0	Currently, we can watch the news channel and surf the Internet when we meet some puzzle.
7.0	To be more specific, when we want to know something about the relationship between Japan and
11.0	I agree with that statement.
11.0	I think know the things arund the world is a very important thing, you can know somethingmay change the world ,although they don't affect your daliy life.
11.0	There are two reasons.
5.0	First of all,knowing things happening around thr world can help people makes new social connection and more friends.
8.0	Because in the real life, a person who knows everything can,people will think this man is very interesting and knowlegeble.
8.0	And they can talk with this person without embarrased,they will enjoy with the talk.
8.0	For example, I have a friend named Max,she is a very charming girls,because she knows amost everything around the world:where are the wars,who's married with the top star,where can we find the new restaurant etc.
8.0	So we like to talk with her,and she has many friends too.
8.0	We could know that if people pay attention on these things which are happening ,they can make their life colorful and make more friends.
5.0	Moreover,knowing things happening around thr world can help people build a safe environment to live.
9.0	For example, if there is a new virus in Africa,and someone brought it in China,people who knew this thing could proctect themselves to avoid the infection,for example eat madecine or wear the masks etc.
9.0	In opposte, if they didn't know about it,the situation would be worse.
0.0	In conclusion,with the aid of the technology developement,we can learn about the events happening around the world very fast and easily.
0.0	And knowing things can help people make more friends,being a knowlegeble person,and help people build a safe environment and avoid something dangerous.
0.0	SO knowing all the events is a very important thing.
3.0	Have you ever seen that some people get high salaries but still have no passion or power when they are doing their work?
11.0	Some people in the society thinks that if universities give professors more salaries, they may educate students better and more active than before.
11.0	When it comes to the opinion that it won't improve the quality of education whether universities give professor more salaries or not, I strongly agree.
11.0	There are three statement that help me to demonstrate my idea.
6.0	First of all, I think it is insignificant for improving the education to increase the professor's salaries.
8.0	The reason of that is professor will try to do their work perfectly if they are really like this job.
8.0	If they are not interested in their job, increase the salaries won't stimulate them to do their work better.
8.0	For example, my Math professor didn't her work.
8.0	She always wanted to finish their teaching and go home early.
8.0	She never thought about whether her students obtain the knowledge or not.
8.0	One day, her university decided to spend more money on salaries for professors.
8.0	Although she was really happy, her working attitude was not changing at all.
8.0	She just thought that it was just a good fortune.
8.0	Therefore, increase the salaries to the professor is unnecessary to improve the quality of education.
1.0	Furthermore, I think that if peofessor's salaries increas, many people may want to get more salaries and then want to be a professor.
1.0	It will be more difficult to choise the elite in these large amount of applicant.
8.0	For instance, my father is a privite tutor.
8.0	He got a common income when he do his work at first.
8.0	But few years later, tutor's salaries increased really quickly.
8.0	Then many people wanted to be a tutor.
7.0	It led the
12.0	In my opinion,it's good for children to make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.
12.0	First of all,children often learn knowledge best in their own experience.
12.0	What's more,it's a great time for children to complete something on their own,which is useful when they grow up,especialy working in the company.
6.0	When i was young,i was addicted to the computer games and failed to get good grades in the exams.
8.0	But my parents just reminded me of the school work rather than controled my life.
8.0	I refused to listen to the recommodations from my parents and then i didn't go to a good university.
8.0	I feel sorry for myself and have learnd lecture from the experience.
8.0	Now i know if you want to get good results,you must try your best.
8.0	Do not dream about success all day,remember,no pain no gains.
12.0	Nowadays, with the quick development and change of social circumstances, people attach increasing significance to getting to know a person, which is usually the first step to develop friendship and an effective way to improve relationship, or at least can provide common topics for a smooth conversation.
3.0	And there are several ways to achieve this goal.
3.0	Some people suggest that having a small talk with the person woule be useful, while others believe observing the person's appearance can help a lot.
3.0	As for me, I think that we can learn about a person from the books and movies that he or she likes.
4.0	First and foremost, the books and movies the person likes usually reflect his personality.
8.0	To be specific,people who like to read comic books and watch comedies may express outgoing characteristic.
8.0	For example, my brother, who is quite outgoing, has a whole shelf of comic books.
8.0	He says he feels relaxing when reading these books and he can find interesting jokes in them.
8.0	This strongly related to his enthusiastic personality.
8.0	While a person is more likely to be sensitive if he prefers to watch tragedies.
4.0	In addition, we could know his hobbies and the field that he is interested in easily from his favorate books and movies.
9.0	Watching fiction movies may suggest he is crazy about universe or high-techniques.
9.0	Because these kind of movies always include spaceships with cutting-edged techniques and spenledid scenery about universe.
4.0	Last but not least, through the books and movies the person likes, we can realize what thing he is going to do.
9.0	There are many tool books that people only read them at specific situations.
9.0	For example, if one of my friend reads books about tourist sites in different countries, I will know that he is planning his travel in summer vacation.
10.0	According the fact
11.0	In such a highly competitive society, people are paying  an increasing amount of attention to making decision independently who is young people.
11.0	There is a heated discussion regarding in contrast to the past, today young people are better able to make decisions about their own lives.
12.0	Different people present dissimilar opinion.
11.0	In my opinion, I agree that today young people are better able to make decisions about their own lives that it was in the past.
5.0	First of all, young people are more mature now than they were in the past.
8.0	This is because the pace of progress is too fast, young people have to become more mature to make decisions.
8.0	For example, my dad did not have clear goal to konw which university he went to, when he was young, and his parents help him to make decision which school to go to.
8.0	However, nowadays, I have a clear goal which university I want to go, because I kown what will I do in the future.
8.0	My parents do not interfere my decision.
8.0	As the example indicates that today young people are better able to make decisons about their own lives.
5.0	Second, parents today are more willing to listen to their young children's decision, because today's parents are more open minded.
9.0	For instance, my friend called Marry, she want to become a game host, but her parents hope her to become a nurse.
9.0	Her parents do not interrupt her dream, and support her to become a game host.
2.0	Judging from all the evidence offered, we may safely arrive at the conclusion that today young people are better able to make decisions about their own lives that it was in the past.
12.0	I always believe that have fun playing games or sports can be the best use of time.
3.0	There are three main reasons that can prove my statement.
11.0	The first is that there is not only professional knowledge in our daily life.
11.0	If we wants to have a good life, keeping a good health is also playing a significant role in it.
9.0	The older I become, the more impotant that I think doing sports is.
9.0	Having fun playing games is also good for children to relax.
12.0	It just like the news on the internet that there is a good student in a great university, being dead because of doing too many works, always being in high pressure and doesn't have a good health.
5.0	Second, having fun playing games or sports can make contribution to your communities.
8.0	It remains me of my own experience.
8.0	I have a good grade in high school I think.
8.0	But after I join the university in my country, I found that here is not only study, but also many kind of other challenges like communities.
8.0	At the beginning, I just wants to study because I think students in the university should study only.
8.0	If you have a good score, you will get friend.
8.0	But time goed by, I found that playing together is a better way to build a friendship than score in university.
8.0	For now, most of my friendship were built during I was playing basketball.
5.0	Last but not least, interest is the best teacher I think.
8.0	Just think about it, if you were a child and you have study the whole day.
8.0	You go home after the class.
8.0	Your friends are witing for you to study.
8.0	It's so terrible for me to image that.
8.0	What a boring life it is!
8.0	I don't believe I will have a good effecienty at that time.
10.0	So that why I think p
3.0	Work is important for workers and company.
3.0	Improving workers' satisfation is essential for a company.
3.0	I think workers wound be more satisfied when they do diffrent types of works.
3.0	The first reason is various works could bring freeblood to workers.
3.0	If workers always do the same work day by day,the would feel tired easily and lose their interets.
12.0	On the contrary, staff could get happiness when they trying diffrent interesting things.
5.0	The socond reason is diffrent works could guide workers to attain new skills and people often feel happy for this.
9.0	Always doing similar work stops people from learning new things.
9.0	While diffrent works require diffrent skills,if a worker try to finish other works he counld get more advatanges.
5.0	The third reason is that when we attain various skiils we counld use them in a work which could make them work better,then they wiil feel confident and satisfy when they work.
8.0	For example, my sister ia a manager in a restuarant,she only manage her staff in the beganning.
8.0	But she found that she coundn't made propar rules to manage her staff.
8.0	So she desided to be a waiter a week, after that she knew the work's daetail as a waiter so he cound make good rules for her staff now.
2.0	For the three reasons above, I think work diffrent types of tasks could bring more hapiness for us and it has advantages which doing similar work doesn't have.
11.0	With the repid development of our society, the emotinal feelings are becoming less necessary, people may have totally different attitude towards wether we should help those who we are not fammiliar with.
12.0	Some people hold an oppnion that liars may dressed in poor conditions, cheating on those warm-hearted people.
11.0	While others still believe in human's moral spirits, argued that it is the ignorence of the whole community that made those who are truly starving facing the situation of struggling to death.
11.0	From my point of view, I think people are less willing to help others nowadays.
4.0	First, it can be easy seeing that we are surrounded by amount of liars and cons.
8.0	The news shows on the internet and televion indicate we should pay more and more attention to not being cheated by others.
8.0	Once being coned by lairs, people tend to unwilling to help others because of the impact followed after heart being destroyed.
8.0	For example, beggers lying almost everywhere on the street, which makes people have less concious of sympathy, we don not know if it is a right behave to give money to these beggers, nor do we if give money can be that much helpful.
4.0	Moreover, people today are more willing to focus on themselves rather than strangers.
10.0	As the ecomonic expending, the price goes up day by day, the financial stress forces people fatsen their wallet,
4.0	Addmitedly, helping others has always being a good moral standward behavior, if we just help those strangers who looks struggling, we may
2.0	To sum up, too many liars and the focuing on ourslves made it hader fo modern citizens to help strangers.
12.0	Of cours, in the society to be honest is one of the best character, so I think people should always telling the choose.
8.0	At fist, people always like honest one.
8.0	We think honest people is sincere to us, so we will treat them in the same way.
8.0	And tell truth can bring two people more intimate.
8.0	For example, my best friend and I, we met each other in a after scool class,we sat at the same table, at fi
11.0	In my opinion, the idea that parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade is not good.
12.0	On the one hand, the purpose for children to study in school is to get new knowlege and improve himselves, not to get money.
8.0	When the child is young, he won't understand completely why he needs to go to school.
3.0	As a child, he may just want to play and have fun.
8.0	While study sometimes can be very boring.
8.0	In this case, he will think he must go to school because his parents will become angry if he don't.
8.0	And then, if at the moment you propose to offer money for high grade, he  will change his reason.
8.0	But later, the child will last studying for money for a long time until one day he finds the real meaning of study.
6.0	On the other hand, children should realize they study for themselves not for their parents.
8.0	When the child grows up, he will leave home and live by himself.
8.0	He will convert what he learned before to production to the socity and get the  corresponding  pay, such as friends, respect, honor and money.
8.0	We can't live a life with our parents.
8.0	We need to take care of our parents when they old.
8.0	So children should know the person who benefits from his study is himself.
10.0	In a word, the behavior that
3.0	These days, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debated mong people: whether young people today are more likely to invest their time and efforts in improving the world than the young people in the past.
11.0	From my perstective, it is true that contemporary young people are more likely to  pay attention to improving the world.
12.0	My point would be elaborated as follows.
5.0	Firstly, the development of technology allow young people today have easier access and more methods to improving the world.
8.0	With the development of Internet, young people today can pay attention to the events and news happened all over the world, so they can learn more about the problems and find plenty of resources on the internet to solve the problems.
8.0	In addention, the advanced transportantion allow the yound people today to travel around the world to investigate the situation and discuss solutions with local people.
8.0	On the contrary, young people in the past cannot learn about the situation of the world, let alone find solutions to improve the world.
8.0	For example, I learned about the issue of global warming on the internet and l found out the brief causes of the problems through the Global Database, so I took part in the Summer Camp of Harvard University to Hawaii to find solutions to improve the water condition.
8.0	How could put the peotection of environment  into practice in the past without learning this situation.
5.0	Secondly, the education of world-problems make the contempory young people form the awareness of concentrating on global problems.
8.0	The education system put the social  issue on an improtant place, which means that paying attention on the global problems is a required courses of the young people today.
8.0	With all the teachers and friends learning about the peoblems  put their effort to improving the world, young people today would get to know the improtance of protecting the world and put improving the world into practice.
8.0	However, young people in the past would concentrate on finding adequate food and clothing, also they did not know the sighificant of improving the world.
8.0	A research of the United Nations is the case in point, in which the professor compare the survey in the past and today.
8.0	It turns out that seventy percent of yound people today would pay attention to global  warming and other issus, while only ten percent of people in the past show the same result.
7.0	All in all, it is true that young people today pay more attention o
3.0	In fact,there is a kind of tendency for parents are attaching increasingly importance on their offsprings'education with the improvement of their financial condition.
3.0	Nevertheless,whether paying much for their childern's great mark is a proper way to encourage them to acquire better achievements still provokes much debate.
11.0	As far as I am considered,the action may lead to some bad consequence opposite to parents'expectation.
5.0	Admittedly, the material reward is sometime useful in study.
8.0	For pupils,they may be more willing to study for a relatively high grade in their school if they are recognized the benefits such as getting a expensive toys and so on.
8.0	And in some aspects,the higher grade is likely to illustrate a better study attitude and a greater achievements in academy fields.
8.0	There is no doubts reasonable towards many parents.
8.0	However,it is likely to spark some pontential problems either.
5.0	First of all,offering much money to school-age  children may not encourage them to spend more energy on education as what we image.
8.0	Actually,it is often the cases that when they are rewarded for small progress they made,these students become dizzy with their study.
8.0	And the emotion ,instead,will contradict with their parents'predict.
8.0	In other words,for children who are far from mature,this kind of encourage can arouse worse result rather than its counterparts.
10.0	Apart from that,it is a plau
3.0	When talked about whether one's love shows personality, people usually exhibit an air of uncertainty.
12.0	Some people claim that interests can be variaty and it dosen't means that every interests fit one's characher perfectly, while others advocate that what we like associate with something like value or race directly.
12.0	I belive that we can learn from the books and movies that this person like about this person.
12.0	My reasons and examples are listed below.
6.0	People attracted by a book or a movie usually because they felt some empathy with this media.
8.0	To be specific, mabye we have the similar life with heroin in the book.
8.0	Therefore, when the character failed in exam or break up with boyfriend, we reminds the same thing happend in our real life, then we cried because we know how painful they are.
8.0	If you felt that scenarios in the movie are ridiculous, you won't like it most of the time.
11.0	In agree with this statement.
11.0	Having a break is essential way to achieve your goals.
12.0	and relax is also subdivided into many different meanings.
8.0	"For example,after a 30-minute studying,your brain may be thirsty for a ""fresh air"",so you want to have a paluse,a relax."
8.0	At this moment,most people will choose to stand up and look around.
8.0	in fact,relax is a commom reaction witof our brain and body.
8.0	after a 3-hour-long  concentrating on one  thing,people may feel uncomfortable both physically and mentally.
8.0	what kind of  ways of relaxing would people choose is where we are talking about.
6.0	biologilly speaking,the tiredness is divieded into physical-tired and mental-tired.
8.0	if we got a mental-tired(long-time study),doing some mental-relaxsuch as watching a movie or reading a book is the best way o release our fret.
8.0	by the way,you don`t have to concerd about the over-usage of your brain,because they work in the different areas of our brain while watching movies and learing knowledge.
8.0	"to be honest,""changing the using area of our brain is the best way to relax""is  always my motto."
8.0	you can develop many hobbies and you won`t feel tired or boring.
8.0	it also makes you a powerful man.
0.0	one the other hand,if  you are in a physical-tired(long -time joging),i don`t think doing physical exercise is a good option.
0.0	people seem to prefer watching movies.
0.0	by the way,you can doing exercise after a long-time study,but in my opnion,it does no differences with a awake sleep.
0.0	in a shell, i think relax mentally is  better.
3.0	To take what kind of job is a crucial decison for people to make.
11.0	Since this is a primary and crucial choice, many people think that it would be better to take jobs that are similar to their parents'.
12.0	Another part of people is not approval of the view.
11.0	As for me, I encouge people to take jobs that are different from their parents'.
11.0	My reasons are as below.
4.0	Firstly, to have passion on jobs requires the person to have an interest in their jobs.
8.0	Insteret is an effective motive of driving people to work.
8.0	In my opinion, I would like to take a job that is corresponding to my interest rather than that I see as a dull task.
8.0	I do not think that someone would achieve his work extraordinarily when he totally is not interested in his work.
4.0	Futhermore, your parents' job is suitable for your parents, not neccessarily for you.
8.0	Take one minute to think about the question, maybe it is very convenient and relaxing to take your parents' job, because they would provide many suggestions and advices for you, but is this job really what you are good at?
8.0	One of my friends was a teacher, her parents were all teachers as well.
8.0	After she was enrolled in a high school as a teacher, she found that it is very exhaustive for her to handle the whole class of students.
8.0	Not long after that, she chose to quit the job.
4.0	Lastly, I think it is important to choose what you want rather what is easier.
8.0	Easier job may make you think that you are capable.
8.0	Then after a while, you will be satisfied your current level of competence and forget to improve yourself.
8.0	From my point of view, to take a job that might be little hard for me is more meaningful than to take a job that proved to be easier for me.
1.0	As a conclusion, I am more approval of taking a job that is different from the parents'.
1.0	To try something new may give you new experiences and gains, then you may have an distinctive life.
3.0	Nowadays,people are increasingly deamding the pursuting of happiness or satisfication.
12.0	so some people think do some all kinds of tasks can aquire some satisfication or happiness , but some people think do some same work which also can aquire  some satisfication .
12.0	form my prospective, i consider that different people have different opinions.
6.0	obviously, i think many people can't stand to repeat  their action ,because it's so boring , they can't endure this work which is just like mechanical.
7.0	so they will want to try all different work or task ,although this task is hard ,but it'
3.0	At prsent, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people: whther people will spend less time cooking and preparing  foods in twenty years than they do today.
3.0	I believe that people will spend less time on cooking since they have high-tech cooking machine which can help them reduce the time spent in cooking.
11.0	What's more people can buy some delicious food easier than today.
6.0	To begin with, the development of technology allows people to reduce the time spent in cooking and preparing for food, which can be predicted through what is happening now, compared with what it was in the past.
8.0	Today, we have microwave ovens to accelerate the cooking process.
8.0	We just need to buy some food and wash it , put salt and send it to the microwave ovens.
8.0	What took hours for us to prepare costs only a few minutes today.
8.0	So we can safely say that in twenty years from now, the technology will be more advanced and continue to help us reduce the time for cooking.
10.0	To be followed, waim
3.0	There are increasing in the number of graduate students take their career.
11.0	Some people think that for a better future job, the ability to relate well with people is more significant than hardworking in school because they could make more friend and have better access to resources in the future career.
11.0	In my perspective, I think studying hard in school is more important.
4.0	First of all, I think studying hard in college is the responsibility of a student.
8.0	And the business will consider the sense of responsibility of an employee as a significant feature.
8.0	Think about this, there is a student do not even study in the college.
8.0	When the professor tells him to write a paper he just ignores what the professor is said.
8.0	He does not take the responsibility of a student.
8.0	If I am the employer of a company, I won't recruit him as my staff because the irresponsible of a company will slow down the development of a company.
4.0	Secondly, I think studying hard in school is very essential because students can acquire more knowledge.
8.0	The knowledge they learned will be very significant after they graduate.
8.0	For example, there is a software designer who is already graduate.
8.0	He have learned some knowledge irrelevant to his major, like business management.
8.0	When he gets older and older, his typing ability will not be as swift as his younger time.
8.0	Then he will become less productive for doing software work.
8.0	And he can switch to another working spot like the manager of some department.
8.0	In this way, he could still work in this company.
4.0	Admittedly, make more contact with others plays an important role in college time.
8.0	When people meet more friend, there will be more people who could help them in the future.
8.0	Nevertheless, I think everyone has their own friend circle.
8.0	When a man has more knowledge, his friend will also have more knowledge.
8.0	So there must be some friend who will help you in the future.
8.0	Moreover, I think when people get more outstanding, they will be easier to access to resources.
8.0	The resource of the boss is obviously more than the resources accessed by the lower stage staff.
0.0	All in all, I think studying hard is outweigh the ability to relate to people.
0.0	It not only trained the ability of a person but also broad one's future route.
0.0	And they could relate to more people after they become distinct.
12.0	With the remarkable development of technology, Internet is becoming more and more dispensible, which enables people to communicate with each other in such a long distance while promotes the efficiency of working magnificently.
11.0	So a large amount of people start to believe that Internet is becoming more important than transprotaion, thus goverment should spend more money on the improvment of Internet access than public transportation.
11.0	From my perspective, I agree to this arguement.
5.0	First and foremost, Internet provides much more convenience of communication than public transportation does.
8.0	Nowadays, if people want to talk to an old friend, all it needs is to take out our cellphone and chat with he or she on the social application.
8.0	But taking a bus or metro will take much more time, while it is even impossible if the distance is too far.
8.0	For example, my best friend had a birthday a few months ago.
8.0	However, I was so  busy that I could not celebrate with him.
8.0	So I just send him a video to express my best wishes.
5.0	What's more, Internet makes it possible to see different scenes all around the world as well.
8.0	We had to cover a long distance if we want to visit a sightseeing, but there are so many pictures as well as journals about the sightseeings all around the world.
8.0	This can really brighten our life.
8.0	For example, every time when I feel upset, I will surf on the Internet and scan on those pictures and videos.
8.0	Different cultures and beautiful sceneries really relax me and broaden my horizen at the same time.
8.0	So I think it is the access to the Internet that provides me a chance to 'visit' those places where I may never have any chance to visit my whole life.
8.0	On the other hand, public tranportation cannot provide me with such convenience.
2.0	However, I am not saying government shouldn't improve public tranportation.
7.0	But considering the fact that society develops and also alters a lot, improving access to Internet is surely more imo
12.0	The answer of this statement depends on my personal experience, life style and emtional concerns.
12.0	In my point of view, teachers are not supposed to voice their personal political views to students in the classroom.
11.0	Among countless factors which influence the choice, there are three specific aspects as follows.
4.0	For a start,  the main reason for my propensity for contrary is that teacher are aimed at cultivating students' learning skills.
8.0	Because students have no choice but enhance their personal ability to face with challenge.
8.0	There are numerous exams in their study career, they have to study extremely hard to go beyond other students due to the current education situation.
8.0	For instance, there is no need for a math teacher to make his politcal views to students because it has nothing to improve his teaching level.
8.0	Therefore, teachers should focus on teacheing instead of making social opinion.
4.0	In addition, an equally essential factor which deserves people's attention is that teacher should provide an opportunity to allow students voice their opinion, as well as cultivating an ability to think issues by themselves.
8.0	Teachers are supposed to provide a platform to let students think, talk and pay much attention to social and political issues.
8.0	Given an example of that one of my political teacher always held a discussion when some social problems happened.
8.0	She hoped we could think and even sovle this issue on our own.
8.0	As a result, I finally form my own thinking system which was not influenced by this teacher.
4.0	The main problem with this arguement is that it is ignorant of the basic fact that students are easiely influenced by teachers' views because they does not form a reflection system.
8.0	Students are too young to be persuaded by others.
8.0	For instance, a student could easily hate some teachers because they have opposite view.
8.0	Thus, he could not be able to listen to this teacher carefully
2.0	Taking into account of all these factors, we may reach the conclusion that teachers should not make their social views to students in the class.
3.0	Today, cars have produced a large amount that can fit people's life.
3.0	However, besides the concenience it give to peoplr, it also cause contamination such as the global warming gas and the noise, so government now try to reduce this pollution by cutting of the number of car.
12.0	In my opinion, the tendency of the number of cars will decrease in twenty years.
4.0	Though some people must against that car exactly give much convenience in our daily life.
8.0	Nevertheless, compare with the long-term development plan, car doesn't play a positive role in it.
8.0	The combustion of fuel such as methane and oil will produce much carbon dioxide that cause global warming, temperature of earth will increase and glacier will melting and many species will extinct.
8.0	So the demerits of car are always more than benefits.
8.0	So governments in many countries  introduce policies and regulations of the car and limit the number of consumption.
4.0	On the other hand, there are many alternatives.
8.0	For instance, subway, bus and other means of transportation are also available.
8.0	In my city, the web of subway  trail is being more and more prosperous and many people choose to take subaw to company instead of car, so the contamination will derease a lot and it will also decelerate the rate of global warming.
8.0	Use public transportation to replace private is absolutely a efficient way.
8.0	Governments also find this point, so in twenty years, less prople will buy cars.
4.0	Thirdly, I personally believe that in twenty years, the places of working and studying must be in home more depends on the development of internet, students can go into a real classroom with VR technology, and teacher just need to turn on the camera and live for students.
9.0	Workers can also communicate with boss and colleagues by using the internet, and all the primary sector like agrculuture and the secondary sector like production will all done by machines.
9.0	as a result, people have no need to go to work or study that will decrease the number of car.
7.0	In conclusion, beacuse of the development of technology and the thought,car willbe
3.0	With the development of the society and the economy, the status of the young people become more and more important.
11.0	A lot of influential decisions are made by the young people and the society also pay more an more attention on the young people.
11.0	So for  the opinion that young people have no influence on the important decisions that determine the future of the society I do not agree.
11.0	And I think the young people will make big influence.
5.0	Firstly, the young people have the most flexible mind and most creative imagination.
8.0	They can bring a lot of new things to the society.
8.0	For example, a lot of scientice bring a big contribute to the society when they are young; Newton found the secret of the power when he is 26 years old and this finding change the world.
8.0	According to these theories convince people that they can use the energy to make the machine more efficient; to make the transportation more quickly.
8.0	All of these stimulate the revolution of the factory and change the future of the world.
8.0	Newton can find these theories to change the world because he was a young people and have creative imagination.
8.0	Maybe a apple hit a elderly people which will not occur anything but the apple hit a  young man who was mainful and full of the curiousness to the world.
8.0	The young people will have full passion to find the truth of this thing.
8.0	In the end, he will change the world.
5.0	Secondly, nowadays the world pay more attention to these young people because they are the future of the world.
8.0	Whatever how capable you are you will become weak with the pass of the time.
8.0	So in the future the world will belong to the young people like us.
8.0	And the society and the goverment will give the young people a lot of help.
7.0	For example, in
3.0	Yet, it is undeniable that reading books or watching a movie is a good way to relax ourselves.
3.0	By doing these kinds of activities, we can refresh our mind and get ready to face the future.
3.0	One of my best friend Jason likes to watching movies and talks about the stories in the movies to me anytime.
11.0	However, I think the best way to relax ourselves is by doing physical exercise.
5.0	First, doing exercise can help us to get heathier.
8.0	Everybody knows that keeping exercise is very important to us to keep healthy.
8.0	Compares to watching TV or reading books, taking exercise requires us to do lots of sports.
8.0	When we get tired after whole day of studying.
8.0	The best way to release the pressure is to doing sports.
8.0	All the troubles in our minds will disappear with our seat after doing exercise.
8.0	"My teacher "" Mr's Lee"" is a person who likes to  taking sports very much."
8.0	She told me she always go to gym for exercise after work and feel herself full of energy.
8.0	By doing this, Mr's Lee looks so young and has a healthy body.
8.0	According the reason above that's why taking exercise is better.
5.0	Second, taking exercise can help people to make new friends.
8.0	There are many different types of sports, and wo also know that there several types sports require people to work together.
8.0	By taking this kind of exercise, people can have different friends and get positive attitudes towards life.
8.0	A real life example provides an vivid example.
8.0	I always play soccer in our school's field.
8.0	I meet many different friends there and I gradually become their friends.
8.0	We also learn the true meaning of working together.
1.0	After all, reading books or watching movies can help persons to get a enjoyable journey in mind.
1.0	Playing sports can take people to a journey with passion and friendship.
7.0	It is true that watching movies or reading books are good ways to entertainment, but the enjoyable memory of working together is what
11.0	I agree on the opinion that young people should learn to plan and organize in the complex modern society.
12.0	Firstly, planning previously can save time in many occasions.
11.0	Nowadays people always have a great many tasks to finish, and the ability to plan and organize previously is essential in our daily routines to make sure that we do our daily tasks on a most efficient way.
8.0	Taking my roomates for example, who is not willing to plan everything in advance, she had an important meeting the next day a couple of weeks before.
8.0	Before the meeting, she have to hand out her paper to our history professor, make up and take metro to the meeting place.
8.0	She had no plan and went to sleep late.
8.0	As a consequence, she got up too late that she missed the metro and was late at the meeting.
8.0	If I were her, I would have estimated how much time each actions would take and make a plan about when I should get up or moving on to the next task to make sure I did everything properly.
5.0	Secondly, by listing a future plan, one can be inspired to achieving goals.
8.0	In modern city, there are so much works that one can do, and sometimes people may be confused about which goals they should choose.
8.0	However, if one plans and organizes, he would learn to know which achievements he wants to reach most.
8.0	With goals set, people are more easily to be inspired to achieve them.
8.0	According to the latest research, people who plans their future previously are more likely to success, and they told the interviewer that they were encouraged by the goals set when they made career plans.
5.0	I admit that on recent years, things changed quickly and far beyond what we expect.
9.0	It seems very hard for most people to make some further plan previously.
9.0	But it is possible that one can plan on something that would happen in near future.
3.0	Watching a movie or reading a book is better   Everyone has their own way to relax.
12.0	but if you ask me about doing physical exercise.
12.0	I will answer you that i will never doing exercise to relax.
12.0	The exercise is a way to keeep healthy.
8.0	but not for relax.
8.0	I like do some peaceful thing when i have part-time.
8.0	Reading can make everybody relaxed.
8.0	Read a great book is one of the best things when you are tried.
8.0	When i have day-off.
8.0	Doing physical exercise will make me exhausted.
6.0	And i don't have time to read book.
8.0	I will call a friend to plain abouk watching a movie.
8.0	Watching a movie can be interesting.
8.0	and never be injured.
8.0	As we know.
8.0	If you often play basketball.
8.0	you will be injured usually.
8.0	This is very dangerous.
8.0	But waching a movie is more safely.
8.0	Waching a movie or reading a book is better than doing physical exercise.
8.0	Reading a nice book will make you more thoughtful.
8.0	And you know many knowledge.
2.0	You can be more voluble.
8.0	Am
3.0	With the dvelopment of techenique getting more and more advanced, the living conditions also improved a lot.
11.0	People who live in the past may have no opportinity to accept the cut-edge education so that it is difficult for  them to make decesions by themselves.
11.0	Because they have no courage to burden the result if they make mistakes.
10.0	But now the people could  analysis the situation more rational, Thus, i think that people don't have to rely too much on their parents as the past people did.
4.0	Firstly, people could use the internet to explore the referance book when they make decisions.
8.0	I know that my brother will graduate from the university after this semester.
8.0	And the most difficult problem he faces is that what kinds of job he is going to looking for.
8.0	His major in the niversity is that medcine.
8.0	So that it is easier to imagine that he will work as a doctor in the future.
8.0	However, he thinks that it is hard for him to tolerate the stress when he starts his doctor career.
8.0	Though his parent's suggestion is that develop him as white angle, he use internet to discover that work as a medcine maker are also a great choice.
8.0	The reason is that it will not exert too much pressure on your neck.
8.0	And after he thinking twice, he decide to follow his own idea.
4.0	In addition, most parents try  to develop the students' ability of making own choice when they were young so that it will also have benefits to them after they growing up.
8.0	My mother used to teach me to follow my intuition when i have to make choice.
8.0	In their opinion, they think that children shouldn't live under parents caring.
8.0	Though the choice i decide may bring severe troubles for me, It is a great opportunity to ecercise myselves meanwhile.
8.0	And i can analysis the matter perfectly in the future.
4.0	Some people argues that  young people in this centry are too lazy to think about their future or making decison.
8.0	In my opinion, though this situation may happen or exist, it may only belongs to some lazy people instead of most.
8.0	We can find that actually most successful merchants all have strong   ability to make decesions when they have to choose the solution.
8.0	The result may get worse than we imagine.
8.0	But they actually can withstand the huge stress and make it right.
2.0	All in all, my opinion is that people in nowdays could make their decesions easily because the external influence and internal effects.
3.0	It is universally acknowledged that always keeping in mind important events around the world is key to success in life, because fresh news always equip us with various kinds of know-how that is practical in daily life and meanwhile give us the chance to bond ourselves with our country and even the world.
5.0	To be concerned about events around the world is like travelling, which enriches our life and broaden our horizen.
8.0	A simple example of my personal experience will suffice.
8.0	Once I read a piece of news on the newspaper saying that the children in Russia wanted to learn about Chinese culture.
8.0	Though it is just a small report, I instantly felt the need to spread my country's culture to somewhere else.
8.0	And I really did that and I taught tea ceremony there, which made me really joyful.
8.0	I just bond myself with russian children there, which is something I have never imagined.
8.0	So this news appears irrelevant to my life, but indeed you can just take a step deeper and contribute yourself to the difficut conditions in other parts of the world.
5.0	Moreover, a wide assortment of the news is conductive to our academic progress, which means the theory in your textbooks is practiced in the real world.
8.0	Sometimes we get confused about the term or a historical event used by our professors, since they are abstract and we have no idea of it's practical use.
8.0	Take myself as an example.
8.0	"When I first met the macroeconomic terminology ""GDP"", I could not understand its importance in the economy of a country."
8.0	It was not until I watched the news program on television aboout economy that I realized that it serves as a precise indicator of the progress of our developement.
8.0	The charts and tables on the screen vividly describe what the number indicates.
8.0	In this way, the significance of news that seems not to affect my life really amazed me and will never be neglected.
1.0	Considering the two factors, getting to know the seemingly irrelevant events happening around the world is a pivotal part in my daily life.
1.0	The era of big data certaily witnesses the importance of news.
3.0	In everyone's childhood, shool activities and assignments are essential part of education, and an interesting memory.
3.0	Recently, an compelling discussion has arisen among the public that should children spend time on doing homework and joining the school activities or on doing whatever they want.
3.0	While some people think it is children's rights to do what they wanna do, I, personally hold the viewpoint that it is necessary for them to spand time in homework and school activites.
12.0	My reasons and examples are elaborated as follow.
4.0	Firsrt, school assignment and activites are significant part for providing students knowledge to face challenges in the future.
8.0	Listening to teachers carefully just can help students understand knowledge, but if they want to streghen these  becoming permanant memory and a part of idealolgy, homework is necessary.
8.0	Only by being apart of ideology, can students use and apply knowlege fluently.
8.0	There was a time when my elementory classmates and I went to park to have fun, and a saleman was selling his candy, who showed us two types of consuming method, buying 20 with 10% discount or buying 5 with 1 free.
8.0	Since we have accomplished home related to this math problem, we sorted it out quickly and enjoying the candy with the lowest price.
8.0	However, if we refused to do homework and playing video games as we like, we could not purchase in such a low cost.
4.0	Besides, school assignment and activites can teach students way of social interperson skills, which will help them a lot in the long term.
8.0	Homework such as group presentations will force students to cooprate together and communicate to find the best solution and work for the same target.
8.0	During these period, they spand time to learn not only knowledge form textbooks, but also these communication skills.
8.0	For example, my sister in junior high school are not usually have to make presentations and holding disscussions with schoolmates.
8.0	She was a very shy girl, but she was obligated to undertake her duty.
8.0	So she tried to face this shortcoming and gradually got familar with speaking in front of many people, which was a huge change.
8.0	By participating in these activities, she developed communicating skills and possessing confidence to move on.
4.0	Admittedly, some times students may under too much pressure of these tasks and activites adn
2.0	In conclusion, spanding time in homework and school activites is an important part of growth, which not only help children acquiring knowledeg but also give them a chance to build up social communication experience.
3.0	First of all, I think that it is every parent's choice to decide whether to offer their children money if they get high grade, and different child will react differently when they get the money.
11.0	So, it is hard to say whether it is a good thing to offer children the money.
4.0	However, as far as I am concerned, I don't think it is a good idea to offer children the money.
10.0	First of all, if children get money when they get high grade, they may consider that they are studying for money, not for getting more knowledge, which is harmful for their future development.
4.0	Apart from that, the action may make the children more greedy, if they get the money because of their good  performance in exam, they may ask for more money next time if they do better.
10.0	As time goes by, what they want maybe a large sum of money that their parents may feel hard to afford.
4.0	Last but not the least, I think that taking money as a reward for children is not a good choice.
9.0	It is a bad thing for children to create their affection on knowledge.
9.0	when they grow up , they may feel bored about study, because they will not like doing things without getting paid.
4.0	What's more, I think there are many other choices that parents can offer instead of money.
8.0	For instance, if your children get good grades in the exam, you can offer them a small gift, rather than barely money.
8.0	Besides, books will also be a good choice.
8.0	You can also take your children with you to a restaurant to allow them to eat what they want.
8.0	By this way, they may also feel comfortable and consider their hardworking on exams worthwhile.
2.0	At last, I do not think it is a good idea to offer children money, but the condition varies considering everyone is unique, so what parents should do is treating their children practically and make the best choice that is helpful for their further development.
11.0	I think it is a good idea to offer school-aged children money for each high grade they get in school.
11.0	I have the following reasons.
12.0	first of all, offering children money for each high grade is an encouragement to the child.
9.0	What is more, it will also make the child understand the old saying 'no pain, no gain'. in this way, the awarded child may be more urgent to get a good grade and have more interest in study.
9.0	besides, the child getting his pocket money in this way instead of paying nothing   is  obversely much more meaningful.
5.0	For the second reason, child gets his money with his good grades, making kids know more about the hardship in earning money.
10.0	In this way, he will not use the money   causually, which is one of the best virtues a student needs to get.
5.0	Maybe someone argues that the action will only make students focus on study and there are many other things worth empheresing.
9.0	Acorrding to the oppinion, I totally aggre with them, and I think the idea can be developed into another idea that offer school-aged children money for each meaningful  activities they do.
9.0	I think this may be more easily to be accepted.
1.0	Anyway,I think it is a good idea to offer school-aged children money for each high grade they get in school.
1.0	Although it might make the kid pay too much attention to studying, nobody could deny that it deeply affacts studengts in life and makes
11.0	Identifying what type of jobs is good is an essential factor in determing a person's whole life, so we are supposed to take measures to make sure whether the job or career is good enough.
12.0	But how can we get the information about this?
11.0	From my perspective, I really disagree with the statement and it is easier to analyse the job in today's society.
12.0	My specific reasons are mentioned below.
5.0	The advent of Internet and new technology lead us get more information than before.
8.0	Smartphone is a good vihcle for sharing and enchanging information.
8.0	I always get some study method from the students who have already graduated by chatting in WeChat--a kind of communicationg imstrument.
8.0	Thus, when I face the same problems them have been through before, I can always avoid making mistakes and save the time to do a bounch of other meaningful things.
8.0	But in the past, we have even never heard WeChat, so people do not have the agency to help them deliver information and warning to others.
8.0	In the field of employment is the same as in school.
8.0	The peole who are retired can always give us their own perspective about job and we can choose whether adapt to me, including the working environment, the boss's temper and the co-woker's characteristics...
5.0	The choice in today's society controlled by oueselves rather than parents.
8.0	In the past, my mother, uncle and ect are all unlikely their major in school and their job in the future.
8.0	That is because, the old thoughts affact their parents, so they always lost their own ability of making choice but chosen by their parents.
8.0	Only small part of them can make some prominent fufillment when they grow up.
8.0	Quite the opposite, today's children are more likely to do their own decision, they always want to build their own life by themselves, so they will try their best to find what kind of job correspond to them and which job can help them success finally, including do some part-time job to experience the job in person, do some intership in the big company and so on.
1.0	In summarize, people in today's society can go along way in identifying what type of career or job would lead to a secure, successful future, because they have more platform to search in the Internet and more courage and chances to experience the real company before going to the job.
1.0	Thus, it is easier to identify it now.
3.0	There always have the history that the best way to encourage child have more confident and passionate to study.
11.0	Since people treat education much more important, they usually think thhousands of ways and use it.
12.0	Recently, the phonomen that parents give their children money as a reward for getting high mark in school has caused wide public concern.
11.0	Some prople think it isn't a good way to encourage child to study harder.
12.0	However I think that giving some money to children as a reward is a good choice, a good choice that its merits weigh out its drawbacks.
6.0	To begin with, giving money to the children as a reward can stimulate children to study harder.
8.0	After the hard working,such as doing a lot of exercise, reading pages, working out the mahing problems...
8.0	and so on, the receive they will get always is the dreamed grade.
8.0	Money can better make them know  their value.
8.0	Foe children, it is necessary for them to keep their interest.
8.0	As for me, money is the most straight way, I can buy something I want as a gift for myself, if I get this price,I will pursue the good mark harder.
8.0	I can also use my money to the bank t   Another reason for me to delicate is that it can increase the children's ability, It is useful to the modern people.
8.0	During that method, children have a chance to manage their money, which is important for the children.
2.0	Judging form what I've mentioned above, I should reinforce my perspective that it is good for parents to give their children money as a reward for getting high mark in school.
11.0	I sincerely do not support this idea and would advocate not adopt it for children's benefit.
12.0	Firt of all, the aim of education is to provide the children with abundant knowlegde to help them grow into holistic people eventually.
11.0	Children should develop the concept that learning is for long-term goal such as further development of intelligence instead of short-term ones including the increase of allowence.
12.0	Taking money as the reward of each high grade will only lead to the short sight of children and therefore cause harm to their growth.
11.0	That is to say, parents' offering money for each high grade of their children will not guide them into an appropriate understanding of the meaning of learning and can even contribute to obstacles on their way of pursuing further education.
6.0	What's more, this kind of reward may even encourage the children to get a high grade by all means, including cheating in exams and so on.
8.0	Children will develop a mindset that the higher mark I get, the more money I will be offered.
8.0	Thus, in order to get a higher payment from their parents, they will try every way regardless of whether they are permitted.
8.0	And that will lead to immoral behabiours of children gradually.
10.0	To
3.0	Nowadays, an interesting topic has aroused a heated debate: for goverments, whether spending more money to improve the Internet access or public transportation is better?
3.0	Some peopel hold the view that the final choice is transportation because they always meet the trafic jam.
11.0	However, as far as I am concerned, it is the development of Internet access benefits people more.
11.0	My view can be elaborated as follows.
5.0	First of all, it helps people broaden their knowledge.
8.0	As we all know, one of the most significant things for government and country is education.
8.0	So usually it is a precise chance to acquire abanduant knowldge by the internet.
8.0	In this way, if the accession to internet is given to more people, there is no doubt that more citizens can improve their richness of knowledge.
8.0	Therefore, more people can take advantage of their ability to accelerate the development of the society by many ways,such as creating more advaned technologies and devices.
8.0	For example, in order to let those who fail to go to school to get the professional knowledge, Japenese government has bulit many projects in terms of the popularity of Internet access.
8.0	Therefore, Japan is still in the front of the world since there are ninty percent Japanese can know the freshest technology online in the world so that they can use it and upgrate it.
5.0	Furthermore, even though a convenient pulic transportation can improve the quality of life.
8.0	However, current people reduce the time spent on trafic if citizens have access to Internet.
8.0	As is known to all, cmpared with going outside to finish the work, people can accomplish almost all the things online.
8.0	Not only can they order the delicious dinner for food on the internet, but also they have the abilty to have a meeting with their co-workers.
8.0	Hence, with the develpement of Internet access, hardly will people be required to leave home.
8.0	For instance, my parents are occupied in their busy business without leaving their room because just by inviting their peers to have a video meeting, all the obstacles in work can be easily tackled.
2.0	From what has been discussed, I can safely draw a conclusion that for government, spending money to improve Internet access is better.
11.0	I think it is not a good idea.
12.0	My suggestions are given below.
12.0	Firsty, as for students, it is a duty for children to stuy hard to get great mark in shool.
9.0	There are no need for parents to offfer money in order to encourage their good grades.
9.0	Otherwise,  the main order for children to study is learning how to get knowledge and enjoy the interesting of exploring unknown area, offer money to them may destroy the original desire of learning.
5.0	Secondly, school-age students are too young to plan how to spent their money in useful ways.
9.0	Even some of them haven't knowing how to spend their money.
9.0	Without parents' teaching and leading, they may wast lots of money or buy something they never needed, these behavior might even harmful for them.
5.0	Last but not the least, compare with offering the money, I believe it would be more usefur for parents to give more care and encourage to their school-age children.
10.0	Even when the children didn't get good grades, parents' encourage and care may help them not so disappointed and fight for more challenges and difficulties in their fulture study life.
2.0	After all, school-age students should not be offered money for high grades.
10.0	It's more important to give them care and encouragement in their study life.
3.0	Recently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people: wheather the teachers should be paid at least as much as some well-paid jobs like doctors.
3.0	Opinions vary from person to person.
3.0	Some claim that teachers should not be paid as much as other well-paid jobs.
11.0	Nevertheless, controry to their views comes to my perspective, it is teachers that should be treated better, especially when the following reasons are mentioned.
5.0	To begin with, paying more salary to the teachers can make them do more contributions to the society.
8.0	It is largely due to thte fact that teachers can transmit many knowledge and their experiences to the students.
8.0	If the teachers have good  salary, Thus teachers would more hardworking, so the students can be developed very quickly, resulting in the fact that they play very significat roles in the diverse areas.
8.0	By contrast, if the teachers have less salary, they have to make money from other places to live, which would probably result in the fact that the teachers were distracted.
8.0	How could teachers' teaching quality get guaranteed if their basic needs cannot get ensure?
8.0	For example, my uncle Jack used to work in a town school, which pay less salary.
8.0	In the modern society, his salary is only 3000 yuan a month, which force him to do some part-time job to make money like a housing teacher.
8.0	In this case, he cannot concentrate his attention to the students, thus his students cannot learn many konwledge from him.
8.0	Consequently, many students cannot be experts in many areas.
5.0	On top of that, paying more salary to teachers can make them be more well-informed.
8.0	The primary reason for this is that if the teachers have a good salary, they could have chance to do some experiments or get accessed to the soces of the studying reasoures, they would be more wise, then them can cultivate students instead of a test-driven education.
8.0	For example, my dad is a high school teacher, who teach in a private school.
8.0	The school have huge budget for the salary and the researchers.
8.0	So dad can get access to al
2.0	To put in a nutshell, I reckon that teacher should be paid as much as other jobs like doctors, lawyers or business leaders.
12.0	In my opinion,watching a movie or reading a book is more relaxing tnan doing physical exercise.
11.0	In the first place,when I want to have a rest for relaxation after working or study,I want to get it easily.
12.0	All should I do to read a book or watching a movie is to take out my smart phone and click the certain APP.
12.0	If I choose to do phsycal exercise,I need to carry the sport tools outside and find a proper place or clean out a place in my room for doing exercise,which are comparably complicated before I have the relax,especailly living in a crowded city and a narrow apartment.
12.0	As a person who really care much about effeciency,watching a movie or reading a book will be my frist choice.
4.0	Secondly,watching a movie or reading a book can provide me more information which may be useful when having a chat with people who has watched the same movie or read the same book with me.
10.0	Providing me more possibility to having a nice talk with other people is also an important reason why I prefer to do so.
4.0	What is more,watching a movie or reading a book will not make me sweating.
10.0	If I have an important conference after a short break,I do not want myself to be embrassed with a wet shirt and a smelly body.
4.0	In addition, doing physical exercise will remind me about my goal made long time ago but never reached which is losing my weight,like many other girls,and this will make me even more anxious.
10.0	That why doing physical exercise is not a good choice for relaxing.
1.0	To sum up,the aim to having relax is to recharge yourself and equip yourself for the later challenges.
1.0	Therefore, choose watching a movie or reading a book will offer you both relaxing astmosphere and extra knowledge,which should be the best choi0ce.
12.0	I don't think this is a good idea.
12.0	Giving money to children  when they get a good grade is a efficient way to stimulate them to take efforts.
12.0	But I think this way is bad for children's growth.
6.0	At frist, giving money directly will make children only pay attention to their grade.
8.0	Children will lost many things valuable in their most preciuos age.
8.0	We can give them some rewards instead of giving the money directly.
8.0	For example, a trip, some desserts, some toys, and more...
8.0	Second, I also thinl that children should not only be rewarded of thier high grade.
8.0	There are many tings that we can do.
8.0	Like doing housework, helping family to buy things, help mather to cook, being willing to clear the table.
8.0	Doing these things should be giving reward, too.
8.0	If we only give money of geting a goot grade, children will only look at thier grade, they will want to do nothing except tinking about how to get higer grade.
3.0	Now, the world is more diverse than before.
12.0	So everyone has their own opinions.
11.0	And the opinions between everyone also have differences.
12.0	But when our in a classroom or a meeting, we need to listen to teachers or the meeting leader.
8.0	They are an individual, so they just says the opinion that they think is correct.
8.0	So when their opinions are conflicting with my opinion, I'll wait until the class or meeting is over and the people gone, then I talk to the teacher or meeting leader.
8.0	In order to improve my impression in the teachers or meeting leaders' mind, keep the discipline well and respecting them.
4.0	Firstly, everyone want to give a good impression to the teachers or meeting leaders.
8.0	If you want to attain the purpose, you need to make them know your differences with others.
8.0	A good way is tell them your great opinions.
8.0	For example, when I was grade 7, during a math class I founded that I has an opinion are more different with teachers'.
8.0	So after class, I went to her office to talk about my opinions.
8.0	Then she said her opinion wasn't the excellent.
8.0	After this, she always think I'm a good student, so my math grade has significant increasing.
4.0	Secondly, a class or meeting must has the rules.
8.0	If I interrupt and correct the mistake right away, others  will not be concentrated on the teacher or meeting leader.
8.0	Maybe the class or meeting will not be continued.
8.0	For instance, a student interrupt the teacher's teaching and tell his opinion.
8.0	And his opinion make a lot of students laughing, so the teacher can't continue to teach the class, after class the teacher gave punishment to the student, because he violates the rules and make the class messy.
4.0	Finally, we must respect the teacher and meeting leader.
8.0	So we must keep their authority in public.
8.0	If we correct their mistake right away in public, they will feel awkward.
8.0	When a leader feel awkward in public, they'll be very angry.
8.0	And we also need to listen carefully about them, because they spend a lot of time to finish it, we must respect their products.
2.0	So I think the second choice is the best, it can also attain my purpose, improve my impression, but also respecting them and other listeners.
3.0	I do prefer use the time for palying games or sports when the parents are not avaliable to stay with children.
3.0	According to recent researches, children are too stressful about their academic performance.
12.0	So, in my perspective, the children should use this kind of time to have fun.
4.0	First, the things related to schoolwork may be very boring.
8.0	The kids may not be able to focus on it without parents' guidance.
8.0	Nowdays kids are required to make some crafts in their home, for example, collages.
8.0	The collage consists of many pieces of paper with various coolor.
8.0	In this case, using scissors are unaviodable, kids may be harmed by the sharp edge carelessly.
8.0	I do believe the parents are willing to see this.
4.0	Furthermore, palying games are genuienly a good way to relax.
8.0	In my personal experience, the video games which were legal for kids to play always contain knowledge the kids should learn.
8.0	I had palyed some video games with my cousin, and the game was very attractive for her because the player can feed the hourses and ride them.
8.0	In this process, I believe that my cousin have learned something about herbivore which may not be covered in their textbook.
8.0	In this process, children are learing without supervising of parents.
4.0	Admittly, the academic performance is very important to kids, but the physical performance is also essential.
8.0	By palying sports like basketball or football, children may exercise a lot.
8.0	Sports are necessary in children's daily life, they can make friends and learn some social abilities, because they are coopreate with their teamates.
8.0	According to my personal experience, the boys who play basketball very well in school are more outcoming, They can build friendship easily, even many girls are willing to date with them.
1.0	To conclud all I mentioned above, I do believe that using the time to have fun palying games or sports is a better approache.
1.0	Children shoud have a good childhood instead of doing a lot schoolwork.
3.0	Nowadays leadership has becoming an dispensible element of achievement and success.
12.0	So how to nurturate the quality of leadership has been attached more and more significance by people.
11.0	Although some people contend that leadership is born with and cannot be cultivate so we just need to take things as they are , I firmly believe that the quality of leadership can be learnt through our efforts.
5.0	Firstly, leadership can be learnt through the training of giving lectures.
8.0	As is known to all that eloquence of one team's leader is essential to the whole team due to the fact that it is the leader who organize the whole team and assign each individuals in the team of their task.
8.0	Therfore it is vital to persuade everyone into what they should do.
8.0	My monitor in my high school left me a deep impression of a excellent leader.
8.0	To become a good monitor, he commit himself to the trainning of eloquence.
8.0	For instance, he always made attempt to persuade someone into benefiting the whole class such as do chores for class and sharing ideas with other students.
8.0	Therefore, he became adept in persuade someone.
8.0	Then our classmates would be willing to devote themselves into the class instead of arguing with the monitor thus so the efficiency of our whole class improved and he aslo lead a good leadership.
5.0	Secondly, leadership can be learnt through the training of scheme strategies.
8.0	There is no denying that it is the leader who make strategies for the whole team and assign tasks to everyone in the teams.
8.0	So an adept skill of making plans is vital for every member in your team to agree with you can contribute to the whole team.
8.0	I still remembered that I was the leader of a team for a mathmatic competition.
8.0	As the leader of the team , I realized that it was not the leader's own ability but the way how to distribute the task that matters.
7.0	So I m
3.0	With the fast development of Internet technology, the way we get information has been changes a lot.
3.0	In these mordern days, we can get much valuable information from Internet, while there are some people concerned about the problems caused by too much information.
11.0	In my opinion, the benefits we get from information and Internet are much more than the problems they bring to us.
11.0	In fact, we should thanks to the valuable information because it makes our study, going out and making friends convenient.
5.0	First, Internet provides us with valuable information which helps our study.
8.0	Nowadays, when we have some problems with our study, we can looking for answers through Internet instead of going to library or ask our theachers or classmates, which is really convenient.
8.0	Take my exprience for an example, when I wrote a course essay last week, I need to read more papers to make my essay authoritative.
8.0	I searched for these papers from Internet and got a lot of choices, which is very convenient.
8.0	I think it made me more effective because I coulld save the time going to library.
5.0	Second, Internet provides all kinds of information, like traffic conditions.
9.0	When we go out and wanna know the traffic conditions, we just need to look for it from our smartphones.
9.0	Everyday when I want to go to some places, I can know how to get there and the traffic conditions, so I can choose when and how to go there.
0.0	Third, people can get information from their friends through Internet, which help them to make and keep firends.
0.0	Today there are many social platforms like Facebook and Wechat which can help we know the recent situation of our friends, just as where they are and what they are doing these days.
0.0	So we can contact with them if we want and get some topics to talk about.
0.0	Last month, my high school classmates found me through Internet and thanks to the information from Internet, we built our connection again.
11.0	In my opinion, parents should not let children to make mistakes and let them learn from their experience.
12.0	My points are as follows.
11.0	Firstly, life is short and precious so that parents should tell children what they should do and what they should not do at an early age, in which way parents can ensure that when children live their life alone, they will not break the law.
8.0	Few years ago, Jachie Chen' by was arrested because of drug use.
8.0	If Chen had told his boy that he could never do anything illegal, such as using drugs, his boy would not be sentenced to jail today.
8.0	Therefore, parents should avoid their  children making mistakes.
5.0	Secondly, parents is rich in life experience and they should help their children when their children know nothing about dangers and failures.
9.0	If a child is left alone at home when a thief come in, what will happen when his parents have not told him not to fight with the thief face to face?
9.0	If a child is addicted to video games and does not mind failing tests, what will happen to his future when his parents have not told him it's of great significance to get rid of his bad habits and focus on study?
5.0	Thirdly, when parents offer suggestions and help their children figure out the solution to problems, they can get closer to their children and know more about them, in which way the children will trust them more.
10.0	Love is a two-street way where you devote your time and energy you will get what you deserve.
2.0	From what I have told above, we can see that it is apparent  parents should not let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.
10.0	Parents should try their utmost to help their childre avoid mistakes.
3.0	Nowadays, more and more people realize the importance of education expecially primary edcation.
11.0	However, I insist the idea that government should spend more on the education of very young children rather than students in universities is ridiculous.
5.0	One the one hand, the financial support for university students was farly not enough.
9.0	The education of univeristy always need much more money.
9.0	Because the lab always need new experimental equipments so that the reseacher are able to do experiments easily.
5.0	One the other hand, the education of very young children won't cost lots of money, let alone the education targets are five to ten years old kids whom know nothing but only be willing to play toys.
8.0	The most expensive objects for kids at such a age would be studying music and buying instruments such as violin and piano.
8.0	I am sure the price of instruments is affordable for children's parents.
8.0	It is unnecessary that government pay extra money to support children to studying music.
8.0	Take myself as a example, according to the statistics made by my parents.
8.0	When i was a parimary school student studying violin only cost thousands of RMB which is almost as 100 to 200 times less as the costy when I was a university student.
0.0	There is no doubt that the education of young children is of singnificance and it costs a lot.
0.0	But i mean, the university education need the money more.
0.0	All in all, It makes no sense that the education for very young children will spend more money than the education for college students.
0.0	I suggest that the government should clean their eyes and provide more financial support for university education.
3.0	Noadays, study have a lot of way, such as study with group and study alone.
12.0	many student like study alone, because they don't like communite with others, but some student like study with group because they can study more efficirnly and also can make some friends.
12.0	so  l agree students work  in group much more effectively than when they are work alone.
6.0	First,  for the project is always have a lot of problem, if one work alone they can not have way to solve the problem because no one can help her.
8.0	If who work with group it will be study more efficirnly, when some have a problem thy can help each other and also they can share the experienment.
8.0	For example,before l was very like training with alone, l think training alone can make great progress.
8.0	once, when l go to the playing the mach l lose the first around. l feel very said, after the calm my coach told me l need training with team that l can know my level and also can learn a lot of new skiil.
7.0	So l try to participate in group, afater a few months l
3.0	Different jobs have differne requirements.
3.0	Some professions like medical research and art perfoemance demand more techical know-how than social skills.
11.0	With the development of our society, even some salers need to study more about their field.
12.0	So I disagree with the opinion that the capability to socialize outweighs studying diligently in school
4.0	First of all, medical researchers are expected to conduct experiments skillfully rather than relate well to people.
8.0	Form a beginner to medical expert, one has a long way to go.
8.0	On average it would take 5 years to finish medical bechlor degree for a Chinese student and subsquently annother 3 years of master degree in research.
8.0	The success in later years of research in medicine require the overall time and energy consumed during the accumulation of skills such as molecular biology, organic chemistry.
4.0	Moreover, if one wishs to be an artist, the success reast with the proweess in art not in dealing with people.
8.0	Lang Lang, an outsatnding pianist of the world, had kept on practicong each note as well as the movement of the great pianisst.
8.0	Ssince he was determined to be a professional artist in school.
8.0	Picasso does not have tobe an expert in communicating with different people because he is not supposed to be talk shouw host.
8.0	All he needs to do is studying hard in the painting school in paris and equip with knowledge to master brush, collor and canvas.
4.0	Finally, those people thinks accumulate knowledge is less significant than social skill, their opinions are according to the past.
8.0	Nowadays, with the development of the internet and the convinence of the social network, you can not imagine how fast we can make a friend.
8.0	The world has became smaller than it in the past, duty to the internet.
8.0	Only if we input more professional skills, we can improve our chance to success in future.
2.0	To sum uo, I hold that stick to academic goals is more important than relating with people becasuse success in many field lies in know
3.0	In these years there are some edition editing books about the autobiography of Stiven Jobs.
3.0	They said they have the enough things to prove the book is perfect inllustrate the span of jobs.
3.0	However can we know a real personfrom the book?
12.0	The answer is not.
5.0	Most of the book would include some personal pespective, these perspective will change the impress of the reader, and it might missing some important things about the person they wrote.
8.0	There is a famous russian emperor named peter, he is a good emperor who lead Russia become a competitive company in that time and name a port to his name St petersburg.
8.0	These famous things will appear in most of the biography.
8.0	On the other hand, he cause a big damage to the culture of the  Russia.
8.0	Only the acadamic research will remain it.
8.0	So most people will think he do the best job at that time.
5.0	If you are not the same generation of the person of the book, you can not understand why the person like this, so you can fully understand people.
8.0	For example the generation which went though the world war 2 must had seen the big recussion of the world.
8.0	So they liked to work hard, because they meet the time about laking of the job and poor.
8.0	However the geneartion of the baby booming after world war 2, they didn't like to work for example there were a lot of hipper at that time.
8.0	This phenomenon came out because that is a peaceful time and people don't need to think about the job and food.
8.0	So if you reading a book for the most of time, you can not fully understand the the person in the book.
0.0	Although there are a lot of moive and book about biography like Jobs, but will you think it is that true, or is that the real person?
0.0	When we watching and reading these things most of the things is not imagination from us.
0.0	So I do not think we can learn abouta person from the books and movies.
3.0	People are more willing to help the strangers who were in trouble.
3.0	In the past,most of people would not want to help strangers because they think if they help strangers when they fall across the road, they may not get ceadit for helping strangers.
3.0	And the strangers might even say why you pushed him?
3.0	This kind of thing lets people no longer dare to help others.
11.0	But now people will not do it.
6.0	Helping others is a traditional Chinese virtue.
8.0	When we were young, the teacher taught us help those in need.
8.0	For instance, books ande clothes are donated to surburban children every year.
8.0	Although we do not know the people who donated or where the books and clothes have been sent,it is a very good thing to do that the children in these mountain areas will be feel happy.
8.0	Sometimes, I pay a dollar to the beggars on the street corner.
8.0	Maybe this is a piece of money for us that is not worth mentioning,but for them may be a meal .
8.0	This kind of great thing to help strangers, why don't we do what we can do?
2.0	Assisting others,I think I'm helping myself.
7.0	if sho
12.0	Nowadays, the pressure of study troubles many students like me which makes relaxing ourselves really important.
12.0	Which way to relax has been controdictory for years.
12.0	Mental relaxing or physical excercise, which is better?
4.0	I have to say that watching a movie or reading a book is quite better than running or playing basket ball.
8.0	There are three main points.
8.0	Firstly, after having lessons, we are ethusted both mentally an physically.
8.0	It's dangerous to go out and do some exercise.
8.0	Because of the low light and quiet surrounding, you trend to be rubbed or something more frighting minght happen.
8.0	Compared with it, watching a movie in the room is really safe.
8.0	It's nearly impossible to be stolen in the movie theater or your bedroom.
4.0	Next, exercise may hurt our body.
8.0	As we can see, many famous sport stars have to stop their career because of the illness.
8.0	So we are likely to be injures while sporting which might have a bad influence on our study even or life.
8.0	But reading a book will never hurt you.
8.0	You can read or watch as much as you like.
4.0	The last, reading or wathcing will inrich our sight and knowledge.
8.0	We can learn a lot while reading or watching.
8.0	In addition getting in touch and feeling the emotion of the charactors are fantastic.
8.0	But what physucak excercise can do is to build our body.
8.0	Without a great soul, a stong body makes no sense.
1.0	In conclution, I rekon mental relaxing is better than physical exercise.
1.0	Book and movies create quantities of colorfu worlds for us.
3.0	I don't agree that some parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.
3.0	Initially ,this way will make children eager for getting high grade and cultivating instant benifits.
3.0	The mind of children is just to get good grade .
3.0	They will not to concentrate on their study.
8.0	When they grow up ,they might get anything they want by any ways ,which is dangerous to themselves.
8.0	Once ,my classmates wanted to get money to buy the poster of star.
8.0	but she could't get high grade.
8.0	Finally ,she copied our top students paper so that she could get high grade to ask her mother award.
8.0	This thing make me sad.
8.0	Because copying others is dishonest ,which will made you do it again and again to get anthing what you want.
5.0	Secondly ,this way will have great pressure to children invisiblly.
8.0	Only they get high grade that they can be offer money.
8.0	If they don't get high grade ,they will get nothing.
8.0	Because anyone can't get high grade in any examination,success  need a  process.
5.0	Thirdly ,children is innocent while adult is complex.
8.0	This way might make children not to focus on study .
8.0	They need to realize the process of success.
8.0	Because every success depend on accumulation.
8.0	Each high grade can't gain by the motivation of money.
10.0	So I don't think this is a good
12.0	As far as I am concerned,it is actually a good idea which is efficient to motivate their chidren to study hard at school and also enables them to have some pocket money to do something they intend to instead of asking each time.
5.0	The more the kids are awarded,the more active they will behave in gaining better grades.
8.0	That means the children will form a habit to get good grades.
8.0	They will realize that once they work hard and achieve their goals,they will be rewarded.
8.0	So in their later life,they will work hard and manage to succeed no matter what they are facing.
8.0	Of course,the amount of the money should be affordable to the family.
5.0	Some may argue that in this way the children will only focus on their grades and ignore other abilities' development,and it may as well lead them to admire in an incorrect way.
10.0	But as only as the children are taught to use the money properly with the guidance of their parents,they will know their parents' love hidden in it and live up to their expectation.
1.0	I've been awarded in this way since 2012.
1.0	kowning I can make attempts to many areas with this money,I studied hard and learned how to get good grades.
10.0	The moment I received the money,I would use it as planned.
7.0	It also gained my ability to
3.0	Nowadays, due to the rapid development of society, the issue of whether itis strict for young people to follow the rules of societies has become a increasingly controvercial topic.
3.0	some believe the rules are strict, while others believe it isn't.
11.0	Although I have some doubt, I tend to agree with the latter, and I will articulate my view below.
5.0	First, the rules can help kids tell right and wrong.
8.0	If they do something that will be against the rules, they will be punished.
8.0	And after punished, they will never to do the same things.
8.0	The reason why they are punished is that the rules have benefit to most of people and accord with persons' the standar of virtue.
8.0	For example, when I was a kid, i was a bad boy.
8.0	I always fighted with other kids with my strong body.
8.0	And I felt proud of it at that time.
8.0	But every thinf was changed after something occuered.
8.0	One day I fighted with other kid as usual when my mom approached.
8.0	She told the thing to school.
8.0	And I was stopped to go to school.
8.0	At that time I only stayed at home and had nothing to eat.
8.0	After then
5.0	Additionally, it is safety that the rules can bing to the young.
2.0	Finally, although the rules are strict, it is beneficial for children ro follow them.
3.0	Education is always a indispensable part throughout human's history and had made a great contribute to human's society or even envolution .
12.0	However, since people are likely to treat education more and more important ,nowadays some parents are using money to encourage their  children to make a better progress.
12.0	Rencently there have caused a widely public concern about this idea.
12.0	Some people hold the view that parents shouldn't to encourage children in this way and it is not good for children's growth.
10.0	I,nonetheless,contend those children who make a great effor to be as good as he can should be rewarded including money.
6.0	To start with, giving money to children as a reward can encourage them to hardworking.
7.0	This has an applicable
12.0	In many books, some senior people will give the young some suggestions, for example, young people shoud have everything planned out and work hard so that they can seize every opportunityb to become successfuly in the future.
9.0	I , as  one of the younger generation, strongly oppose this view.
9.0	We are in our early stage of life,
12.0	Nowadays, celebrities enjoys a great popularity, which allows them to influence the public wide and deeply ,especially their thoughts and ideas can root in people's minds.
12.0	It is under a hot discussion whether their opinions means a lot more to youngsters than the o. As far as i am concrned , they are of greater importance to younsters.
5.0	Firstly they are not matured enough , they are still in the early stage of experiencing the world ,they are eager to learn something about the world and probably follow someone blindly .
8.0	Considering celebrities' big influence ,youngsters are likely to follow their steps and believe what they believe or say.
8.0	We can easily find a fan who wears what his or her idol wear.
8.0	Such copying can be good an d bad at the sametime.
8.0	There were a munber of people believe drug abuse is not a seriouse problem ,because their idols have done that.
8.0	On the other hand ,there were also numerous youngsters devote themselves into charity , which are influence by the celebrities .
8.0	While the old are matured and have already had their own thoughts and values which can not be changed easily .
5.0	Moreover ,we all have been a teenager who will not listen to or talk to the parents but their friends ,For the reason that they are at the similiar age ,they understand each other ,and there exist no generation gaps.
9.0	Those entertainers or athelete are always young that is determined buy the industries , which give them the opportunities to get close to youngsters and be accepted by them ,hence allowing them to truly influnce the young.
9.0	By contrast ,the old usually show less intersts in celebrities ,they will not accept the new things easily ,so it is rather difficult for them to be influenced by celebrities.
2.0	Since youngsters are not matured and feel more close to the entertainers and atheletes , the opinions of celebrities is more impotant to them.
3.0	As far as i am concerned,watching a movie or reading a book is both a acceptable choice for you killing time and realxing yourself.
11.0	However,doing physical exercise is a better way to reduce your pressure.
6.0	Watching movies is able to bring you some new experiences sometimes,but when you are exhausted or your eyes is not comfortable,this way is not a wire choice for you.
8.0	Besides,if there is no one companying you as watching movies,you will feel lonely.
8.0	So,you had better dong such thing when some one go with you.
8.0	Reading books can broad your horizons ,relaxe you body as well as your mind and gain knowledge from free time.
8.0	It truely kills two birds with one stone.
8.0	The two way to relaxe are both indoors.
8.0	As a result,they are only relaxe your mind but not your body.
8.0	So we need another way to meet our needs in bodise----doing physical exercise which not only free your thoughts but also give your muscle enough exercise.
8.0	It makes you happier,healthier and more confident.
10.0	As for me,I like
3.0	There is no denying that both the internet and public transportation have crucial impact on the improvement of our living qualities.
12.0	Additionally, different people have divided opinon about which one is more critical for us and deserves more governments' investment.
12.0	As far as I am concerned, government should spend more money on the enhancement of internet access.
5.0	First and foremost, internet access is fairly benificial for our education, which is worthwhile to be invested.
8.0	That is because we can obtain a large quantily of priecious education resources conveniently and fastly with the help of internet.
8.0	I have a case to aptly illustrate my point.
8.0	I am a postgraduate majoring in Biology,and sometimes what I need to do is writing thesis related to my field.
8.0	To dealing with this work, I prefer to just to search for the latest research papers over the internet without consuming too much time.
8.0	On the contrary, the resource in the school' library is narrowed and hard to be updated immediately, which means that I have to spend lots of time to find what I want.
5.0	Moreover, internet can also be used as a powerful entertaining way by us.
8.0	Nowadays, due to the fierce social competition, it is prevalent for us to face too much burden and stress.
8.0	Additionally, internet is able to bring us lots of enjoyment to relieve my pressure through its multiple amuzement functions.
8.0	My own experience can be a salient example for my point.
8.0	In my daily lives, I am required to deal with a number of experiments and assgnments, so it is not strange for me to feel stressed out sometimes.
8.0	To handle my problem, I usually utilize my computer to watch some popular movies or just sharing our recent experience with my best friends through chating softwares.
8.0	This is indeed a rewarding way for me to calm down and relax.
2.0	Though investing on public transportation is capable to allieviate serious traffic jams in our cities, we can just staying at home without using the cars through internet.
10.0	Tu
3.0	Nowadays, people became busier because they needto do more and more things which is about working, family and so on.
3.0	For these reason, people do fewer things well adn they don't miantian a high - quality life.
11.0	But in my perspective, they need to do all the things and they have ways to do all of these better.
5.0	First, foe the working aspect, they need to do many things for wrok.
8.0	For white-collor wokers, they need to communicate with their mate and clients, and writes many files to his leader.
8.0	That is a employees' work, so if they can just do a very few things, the company may dismiss them.
8.0	For a scientist, if he can just perform the experiment, but have no talent to write a research reports, he will have low fame and no one know the research he make.
8.0	That's why people need to do every thing well.
5.0	Secondly, I prefer that perspective because for a family member, they need do many things.
10.0	In the home, they need to know how to do housework, like cooking, washing the dishes and so on.
3.0	Food is an essential element in our everyday life, we cannot imagine a day without it.
3.0	We all agree with the statement that the way we treat food today is far from the one we used to in the past thanks to the development of the society.
3.0	So there leads a controversial topic that will the people spend less time cooking or preparing food in the near future then we do now, the opinions varies.
12.0	For my personal view, I firmly belive that the time used for cooking and food preparing will be reduced greatly in 20 years .
5.0	Primarily, the improvement of technology will contributes to the saving of time in cooking and food preparing.
8.0	As a skilled cook, I regard the major period of time consumed in the process of making a meal is waiting.
8.0	We need to wait for the water to be boiled, the pies to be baked, the ice cream to be frozen, etc.
8.0	And I'm confident that the future technology will minimize the time of these process with high efficency electronic inventions.
8.0	In this way, it will be unneccessary for us to staring at the pot or waiting by the fridge for minutes.
8.0	Making a meal will be a job that faster and easier than ever.
8.0	Take the example of the Gravity Pot as an example, it is a kind of pot with unique creative features that it can increase the boilling temprature point of water by creating a high gravity inner environment.
8.0	As a result, this newly developed technology makes it possible for people to enjoy their food in a shorter time of waiting, and as the day goes on, I think in 20 years, more inventions like Gravity Pot will come out and makes the cooking itself less time consuming.
5.0	In addition, it's aknowledged that we are living in an era of fast pace, so the form of meal will be reformed results in the reduced time in cooking and preparation of food.
8.0	People are under stressful competition today and their working hours can be long, spending hours to sit down to have a relaxing meal is unaffordable to the most of people since they need to invest most of their time to commute in large cities or work, and the trend is surely to continue in the twenty years.
8.0	So it is common that more and more people are choosing light foods, represented by boxed salad or milk shake to replace the traditional one, which takes lot of time to make and eat for the reason to keep up with the busy daily routine.
8.0	My aunt Judy is office lady who works in a large city, and because of her tight schedule, she choose to use apple juice and cold sandwitch to replace her formal meal since it can be either made or finished within minutes.
8.0	Assuming in the 20 years after, the people might face with more pressure and tiring life thanks to the boom of population, so their time to cook is sure to be less, and they will tend to choose new form of food for this reason.
2.0	To sum up, I think the people in twenty years is more likely to take less time in cooking and preparing food than current, for the newly introduced technology and new form of food.
3.0	There are millions of teachers in my country who are the fudation of the education system of our society.
3.0	Recently, there is a fiece debate about the problem that whether teachers should be paid as least as much as other people who work as doctors, lawyers or business leaders are paid.
3.0	Some people deny it.
11.0	However, from my perspective, it is necessary to pay teachers as much as doctors and other people.
5.0	To begin with, many teachers work very hard every day and usually under great pressure, so they deserve high payroll.
8.0	As we all know, high school teachers have to assign a lot of homework with high quality to students and repeatedly check their homework and correct their mistakes on day basis.
8.0	Obviously, this work is painstaking and sometimes monotonous to some extent.
8.0	What's more, they need to bear the pressure from the students' parents and the leaders of their school, both of whom expect they can cultivate outstanding students.
8.0	For example, when I was in high school, my math teacher always arrived at our classroom at 8 am, supervising us to study hard.
8.0	And we all cherished his homework which helped us to understand the knowledge fully and deeply.
8.0	Once when I made a mistake, he taught me in person to ensure I could understan it.
5.0	Secondly, the work of teaching is significant to the development of science and technology.
8.0	Knowledge is the step of innovation and properity.
8.0	And it is teacher who passes down the useful knowledge to next generation.
8.0	For instance, most of the professors in the University of Washington are prominent scientists who improved the development of our society in numerous aspects, such as chemics, astronomy, geometrics, physics,and archaeology.
8.0	They have a good command of the core knowledge which can ensure the prosperity of our world.
8.0	Those knowledge are worthless, especially when they are taught to the young students in the class.
8.0	So paying enough money to the professors reflecting the importance of the knowledge.
0.0	Admittedly, the amount of teachers are very huge, and most of their salary are paid by governmemt finance.
0.0	So it will be a stressful burden for the government if their salary are higher than doctos, lawyers or  business leaders.
0.0	But we should still pay them enough, at least as much as the doctors and other people, so that we can ensure the education prosperous of our country.
3.0	It is universal that more and more youngsters want to be celebrities and the effect of celebrities also become evident.
12.0	Therefore, there is an popular topic about the famous.
3.0	whether the oponions of celebrities are more essential to younger people than they are to older people.
12.0	Some people holds that their opinions still work on the older people.
11.0	However, I stand opposite sides, I think it benefits more on our young adults.
12.0	My reasons and examples are given below.
5.0	First of all, it can increase the sense of belong of the young adsult.
8.0	It is because the famous have ability to cause more interesting topic.
8.0	When our young people talk about it, they will be easy to find person whi has the same hobbies and who can share real feelings.
8.0	For example, my classmates perfer to watch RunningMan.
8.0	When they enjoyed the program, some words said by actors wounld be focused by ours, such as it is significant for us to devote ourselves for career.
8.0	So after that the topic about career aroused a discussion among our classmates.
8.0	Most of us support this idea, consequently, they worked harder than before in the later study and even made a plan foe their life.
5.0	In addition,  admittedly, some fashionable olders will also accept the opinions of the famous because they also eager to folloe the social steps which may lead them to keep younger heart and have optimistic attitude.
8.0	Whereas, most of older people are unwilling to support the celebrities ideas.
8.0	in their opinion, they had abudant social experiences, in other words, the sault they ate is more than the way you walked.
8.0	As a result, they prefer to follow themselves.
10.0	To put it in a nutshell,
12.0	I agree the statement that parents shuold let their children make mistakes and then learn from their owm mistakes.
11.0	There are three reasons.
11.0	First, it is more efficiant than parents tell their children what they can do or can not do.
12.0	Children have their owm thought, so if you want to let he do something, you must give him a reason.
11.0	As an adult, we all know it is useless to speak without an evident.
10.0	So it does for kids.
6.0	Second, this way give children a deep impression.
8.0	As for me, when I was young my mom always do not make our dog crazy ,or it will bite you.
8.0	But I do not believe what she said bacause dogs are so cute that it looks like harmless.
8.0	However, a dog bited me suddenly when I ws playing with it.
8.0	And then I was taken to hospital several times.
8.0	This thing gave me a deep impression.
8.0	Therefore, I never touch the dog until now.
1.0	Third, they will never do it again if they truely know realize mistakes.
1.0	In a word, let kids do things and learn from their mistakes is a useful way to help them grow.
10.0	But it is important to protect kids when he is trying somthing dangerous.
3.0	In the present, scores of people are very anxicous and busy because they concerned about thier future life.
11.0	In my opinion, people are usually ignore the human who is in struggle rather than helping strangers solve the problem.
11.0	There are two reason support my viewpoint.
5.0	It is a fast-paced world, ,mankind attempt to catch up the trend everyday.
8.0	We even dom't have the time to care our business about future.
8.0	Also, I think in reality, there are only few chances that some caring people would like to aid the stranger who we unfamiliar with thier life, personality, or even the name.
8.0	Taking a Youtube video that I have seen as an example, a rich man pretend he is a begger on the street that require food.
8.0	Majority of peoplw just walk by and does not ask anything, some of human even tell the man go far way from them.
8.0	Suprisingly, another begger come to chat with him and share his food with the rich man.
8.0	This video shows that a lot of people unwilling to help the struggling strangers.
8.0	To be honest, I don't reckon I am the one who have leisure time to help a stranger because we are all busy to plan our life and follow up the world.
5.0	In addition, I think people may feel that is a prank or lie.
8.0	Because there are amount of frauds occured in every corner of the world, people camouflage they are quite poor and stuck in tough life situation.
8.0	According to this, people lost thier As a result, this assumably is one of the reason casue people disregard person who is in genuine srtuggles.
8.0	Furthermore, not all human possesse the ability and potential to help a strangers.
8.0	Although, some people willing to assist the strangers to solve the problem, however lack of opportunities and ability can be the reason of it.
0.0	As a consequence, shortage of potential and money, everyone's own life condition, and personal willingness can all be the reasons that they don't intend to help the strangers who are in struggle.
0.0	In the opposite, I reckon that people factually unwilling to help strangers due to this complex world nowadays.
0.0	It beomes hard to communicate and build relationships with each person.
3.0	With the development of modern society, many young people are searching for the essential ability for them to improve the probobility of success.
11.0	And the ability to plan and organize is taken into account.
11.0	Some of them believe that the ability to plan and organize is not essential to them because of the fast speed of our modern life.
11.0	But in my opinion, it is essential for young people to have the ability to plan and organize.
4.0	Admittedly, as changes in our lives are so frequently, we must grab opportunities in time instead of having the ability to plan and organize to prepare all the things well.
8.0	Some chances in our life will disapper soon if we are restricted by our plan.
8.0	For example, as we all know, Bill Gatze droped out from university, owning a personal company and becaming the richest person in the wrold.
8.0	He realised that   the computer market is very promising, so he droped out immediately rather than to finish his university study as most students planed.
8.0	However, his success is an individual case.
8.0	It is arbitrary to say that the ability to plan and organize is not essential.
4.0	Firstly, with the help of the ability to plan and organize, young people can prepare for their personal works well and finish them in order.
8.0	Making a plan before embark, they will have a whole view which can help them divide their assignments into small tasks and they can finish them one after another.
8.0	What's more, they can find out the most difficult and significant parts in the tasks, so with more practices and attention in these parts, they can fulfill them smoothly.
8.0	Thus, the ability to plan and organize is essential for young people to succeed.
4.0	In addition, in a team work, the ability to plan and organize can insist them in coordinating with the relationship between team members and group works.
8.0	So, they can be a good leader.
8.0	It is essential to prepare for a team work, deside the working processes and assign tasks to the grop members.
8.0	A leader with this ability can give one task of the team work to the most skillful person.
8.0	It will make the work more effencial.
0.0	In conclusion, the ability to plan and organize is essential for young people.
0.0	Although it is importent to grab chances in time, it is more crucial to finish works in order in a personal job and  coordiante all the things well in a team work.
0.0	Only in that way can young people enhace the probobility to become more successful.
12.0	As the Internet and tecnology has developed quickly, people get the information more efficiently,the question of whether people need to know what is happening around the world is a highly debated one.
11.0	Some people think that everyone should know the events from all over the world ,and it is important.
11.0	Other people think it is not neccessry to know these thing, it's wasting their time.
12.0	For me, I strongly belive that people should  know the information from all over the world.
6.0	Firstly,know more information helps people have a wider horizon.
8.0	People can learn alot form these things,and usually have deep thinking in these things.
8.0	I usually watch the international news from Tuiter and Facebook,and last mounth, when I saw a news that a old soldier get lost with his family in the war but finaly find his familly,I feel very warm .
8.0	I learn the love and never give up from this soldier.
8.0	Then I write a lecture on the Internet about this thing to show my opinion that goverment should pay more attention to the old soilder's after war life.
8.0	And this article has been seen by 20000 people.
8.0	So if I don't know this events ,I will never think about the soilder who need help.
2.0	Secondly,people maybe use the things which they have known someday.
11.0	I agree that people today are more willing to help the struggling strangers.
4.0	Today with the development of society, we have get much more rich and live a better life also we become kinder however, we have a even larger distance between the poor and the rich, witch means we have give our hands for those people who are in struggling.
10.0	And having a better life, we have more time and energy to help others.
4.0	Helping others make us happier.
8.0	Nowadays, what we looking for is not just money but spirit.
8.0	After we have had a really good life, we have no any barrier to stop us from helping others.
8.0	And actually, it is.
4.0	More and more news said that people help others, and it just prove that people today are more willing to help the struggling strangers.
10.0	And things like this happens arround us.
10.0	So many schools have volunteer activities that
12.0	In my opinion,I take the same value of watching a moive or reading a book with doing physical exercise to relax.
11.0	No matter how you fix your body and mind,the important thing you should to konw is to seek a way than turly fit in you.
6.0	Nowadays,people are usually stressed out in multiple condition.
8.0	Such as tasks in company or homework in compus.
8.0	That acturely bothers us,right?
8.0	So,we try to relax ourselves.
8.0	Some of us choice to watch a movie,it may be a comdey that can make us laugh and forget our problems,and read a book that writen by your favorite author and it can cheer you up.
8.0	But not all people choice to do that to cut off their trouble.
8.0	They may relax themselves by doing physcial exercise.
8.0	Take my friend for example,she goes to a gym three days a week,it can get our mind away from the horrible things we meet.
10.0	Above that,I am not agree with the following stat
3.0	For thiis statement, I am not so agrree with it.
3.0	I think it is better to relax, if you do physical exercise.
3.0	why?
3.0	when I was in Germany, I have many works to do for example, I have to listing german Classes and at the same time I have to perare chinese law exam.
3.0	And the most heavy pressure is from my homesickness.
3.0	After half a year stayed in foreighn country and could't celebrate chinese new year with my parents.
3.0	At first, I saw many chinese talk show and movies to convey many stress.
3.0	I have to say, it worked in few days.
3.0	But after the movie or the novle, my anxiousiliy was back and it was strongly.
3.0	So I have changed my strategy.
3.0	Every morning I will run with my friend, I remmber those days are spring, I can see the sunrise when I run along the revier and I can saw the friendly housekeepeer with a big smile.
3.0	With these experimences my day was light up.
3.0	I become a active girl again.
12.0	So for myself expeience it's better to go outdoors to do exercise.
9.0	If you stayed in room alone with the lonely air, you will be more stressful.
9.0	With a comedy film you may laugh for 2 or 3 hours but if unfortunatly you choose a tradgy film, you will be more sad.
5.0	And exercise will give you a healthy body and with this you can do everything with active action and can barely feel tired.
9.0	In tthis situation you will easier to make success.
9.0	For most of the people, if they do things successfully their feel for happiness will crease and the same time the stress will decrease.
5.0	There are many ways to relax ourselves, I have to say that watching films and reading  books are good ways,but they are not the best way.
10.0	Only if we make us stronger can we manke things better, and exercises can not only make our body strong and health, but also make our mind more strong because in sport we push ourselves to make more.
2.0	So let's exercise for a better life.
3.0	For recent decades, the issue of choosing jobs is often discussed among educators and parents.
11.0	Though a fraction of people tend to argue that it is better for children to choose jobs that similar to their parents's jobs than to choose jobs that are very different from their parents' jobs,  I personally beileve that children should choose the jobs which they really engage in, rather than just following their parents' choice.
6.0	On the one hand, children can develop their talent in their prefered area.
8.0	It is vital important for them obtaining career success in their social climbing ways.
8.0	To be more specific, when people really devote themselves into what they really engage in that would bring self-fulfillment and achievement.
8.0	All of these could became the motivation to inspire people move forward and make them self-developed and success.
8.0	For example, my grandfather was a famous lawer, but my father was a actor, if my father chose the same job as his father did, I will never see such a wonderful actor in the screen or at stage to perform fantastic plays for us.
2.0	On the other hand, if children always follow their parents' footprint to live that would cannot adapt the intense competition society and non-stop changed world.
7.0	That is to say, jobs would vary according the social development, if children always follow their
3.0	Before reaching a conclusion about the debate, let's back up a bit and recall that is there a phenomenon that obesity rate among young children is increasingly higher?
3.0	Is it familiar to you that more and more children begin to put on glasses at a younger age?
3.0	These kinds of health problems among young children can't be neglected because children are the future of the world.
3.0	So why not engage young children in playing games and sports during the time when their parents are too busy?
3.0	By doing so, childen can have fun with their friends in addition to cultivating the sense of competition and cooperation.
3.0	After all, that time is originally meant for leisure time between parents and children, not for shoolwork, right?
5.0	Playing games can cultivate their sense of competition.
8.0	With the population reaching highest through the history, competition also becomes unprecendentedly fierce.
8.0	To prepare young children for the success in their future life, sense of competition must be cultivated from a young age.
8.0	Playing games, as far as I am concerned, is a perfect way to foster them.
8.0	As we know, there must be victory in a game which motivates the game player to compete for it.
8.0	With the will to champion the game and win praise from others, every child will endeavor for the victory and thus a fierce atmosphere is formed, offering the children involved with a taste of competition.
8.0	Then, they'll know the world is not always nice and there do exists frustations in life.
5.0	Playing sports is a perfect method to recognize the significance of cooperation.
8.0	By playing sports, one can obtain extrinsis and intrinsic income.
8.0	They can not only strenghthen their bodies, but also learn many spiritual lessons.
8.0	Take basketball as an example.
8.0	By playing sports like this, they will be aware that they should rely on the teamwork to win the game, no one could do it alone.
8.0	And that will leave a significant impression of cooperation in their minds, which is very helpful for their future life.
1.0	All in all, playing games and sports has more advantages than disadvantages.
1.0	So doing this in the busy time of their parents is a good choice!
3.0	Nowadays, the issue of how to pursue a craeer has become one of the hottest topics in people's daily life.
12.0	Someone states that people are more statisfied when they have many different types of works and others contends that people feel more content when they do similar tasks all day long.
11.0	However, as far as I am concrned, I believe workers are more satisfied when they pursue all kinds of job.
4.0	First, the popele who have many different types of career are more likely to find what they are reallly interested in.
8.0	For example, I have an uncle who majored in economy in university.
8.0	After he graduated from university, he found a job as a financial reporter and after a peoiod of time he was not like this job so much, because he didn't not like the feeling of sitting in front of the computer all day.
8.0	Then, he went to apply for a jon as an accountant, however he was not so interested in accounting.
8.0	Finally, he decided to try to be a math teacher, and at there, he found what is he really interested in and very satified with his current job, as he liked the feeling of imparting knowledge to others.
8.0	So if he didn't try diferent kinds of job before.
8.0	He will not have the oppurtunity to find what he really interested in and he will not be satisfied while working.
4.0	Second, tring all kinds of job can make us keep a feeling of freshment while working and we wil feel much happy.
8.0	Because people are always pursue a positive atitude toward new things.
8.0	So we will keep this feeling of freshement all the way while working and we will not fee dull.
8.0	However, on the contrary, the peopple who are do similar tasks all day long, they will creat a negative emotion toward their work and will feel tired and boring while ding work.
8.0	As a result, their work efficency will also be affected.
8.0	So doing all kinds of job is better.
4.0	Adimittedly, someone may contends that pursue all kinds of job is unstable and you may face the porblem that lose the job.
9.0	It is true that tring different jobs may ahve some risks, but actually the ture essence of life is keep tring all kinds of thing and acuire the sense of satisfying from it.
9.0	So pursue all kinds of career can add more fun and surprise to all life.
2.0	In conclusion, I think people are more satisfied when they have many different types of work, as they can find what they are really interested in and feel more happy and keep a sense of refreshment while doing work.
3.0	Nowadays, celebrities's opinions are becoming more and more important and influential.
3.0	Whenever asked whether celebrities' opinions are more important to younger people than they are to older people, crowds usually exhibit an air of uncertainty.
11.0	However, I wholeheartedly agree that the opinions of celebrities are more important to younger people.
4.0	To begin with, younger people pay more attention to celebrities than older people do.
8.0	It is known to all that younger people are more likely to have an idol than older people do.
8.0	So they will pay more attention to celebrities' comments and opinions, and start to follow their idols.
8.0	For example, younger people in China likes to buy things on internet nowadays, and celebities like Fan Bingbing will post their feeling of some products online.
8.0	Whatever she recommended were bought by younger people, nomatter the prouducts are good or not.
8.0	However, older people seldom pay attention to those information.
8.0	As you can see, younger people are more likely to pay attention to celebrities' opinion than older people do, which means celebrities' opnions are more important to younger people than older people.
4.0	Then, younger people faces more puzzles than older people that celebrities' opninons are more important to them.
8.0	Most older people have retired, and they do not have much troubles other than health problems.
8.0	What's more, they can be taken care of by their children and the government, so they have not much things to worry about.
8.0	On the contrary, younger people have to face a series of problems like their salaries, their parents and their children.
8.0	And nobody will help them.
8.0	At this time, they can listen to celebrities' opinions, which may be useful to themselves.
8.0	Because they are so busy during weekdays to ask their friends for opinions, not to mention that their friends may be busy and puzzled by exactly the same problem.
8.0	At this time, celebrities' opinion seems very important to them, because celebrities have more difficult life than ordinary people.
8.0	So celebritie's opinion can be useful and can also comfort younger people.
4.0	Last but not the least, I admit that the opinion of celebrities are also important to older people.
9.0	However, older people have faced a lot of problems when they are young.
9.0	Thus, they have the ability to think, and they may think twice about the celebrities' opinions because they believe in themselves more.
2.0	To conclude, although sometimes older people may think celebrities' opnion as very important, but compared to younger people, celebrities' opnions are obviously more important to yonger people than older pe
12.0	There are always various opinions about parients who offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.
11.0	Some think in this way the children will be encouraged to sutdy hard, while others believe that it's not a good idea at all.
12.0	Based on my real life experience, I disagree with those parents who offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.
10.0	Here are some reasons about it:
5.0	First of all, if the parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school, the children will probably miss understand the meaning of studying.
9.0	The exams offered in school are a method to check the quality of learning, not for examming the amount of money that should be given.
9.0	if the parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school, those kids may think that to study well is all for getting money.
5.0	Secondly, the children may use unappropriate methods to achieve there goal of getting enough money if parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school, such as cheeting.
7.0	Because they are just kids,  they can hardly resiste the desire of getting more money, so if  parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school, they
11.0	I agree with the opinion that the option of celebreties,such as entertainers and athletes,are more important to younger people than they are to old people.
4.0	First,younger peoples altitude needs play.
8.0	Sometimes some younger people have lucky situations like won the lottery,get good grades on the test,going to go to study at university.
8.0	These can be really happy to the younger people even to their family.
8.0	If ther's no celebrities,the life can be really boring.
8.0	It could be have bad influence on the younger people.
4.0	Second,some famous entertainers and athletes have their own celebrations.
8.0	Like Olympic Games.
8.0	They have a celebreation of gold,silver and brass metal.
8.0	Our China International Sports Team has won several Olympic Games metal.
8.0	Through 2008~2017,several Olympic Games like Seoul 1988,Beijing 2008,London 2012,Sochi 2014,Rio 2016,we, our Chines athletes has won lots of honor in sports.
8.0	We Chinese citizens are very proud of it,even  2008 Beijing Olympic Games,it's our first time that we held Olympic Games in China.
8.0	In 2022,Beijing will held Winter Olympic Games.
8.0	Also these athletes are younger people.
4.0	Third,some very big Science and Technology activity is also could be celebrated.
8.0	These young worklers spends day and night to sacrice his time on research of science and technology,Especially on space.
8.0	There are many new young workers in CASC(China Aircraft and Space Company).
8.0	They are good generation of space include 10 astronauts.
8.0	Back to Oct 13th,2003,our China has first launch the spaceship Shenzhou-5(SZ-5)and Astronaut Yang Liwei.
8.0	This can be proud for any Chinese.
2.0	In the end we should hold some celebrities that it is has related with the tradictional festival like New Year's Day and other festival.
3.0	As the development of  the socity became increasingly faster , more and more worker are looking satisfaction on the job .
12.0	Some people believe that having different type fo task to do during the work day are more saitisfied to them wile other people think the they are more satisfied when they do similar tasks all day long.
11.0	I think having different type fo task to do during the work day are more saitisfied, and there several reason to name.
5.0	First of all, the worker who have different task will gain satisfaction longer.
8.0	The worker who have similar task may gain satisfaction at first, and soon thay will feel boring about this then lose satisfaction.
8.0	However this won't happen on  the worker who have different task.
8.0	because there taske are keep changing.
8.0	They won't feel boring on it , And feel satisfaction after they finish every task.
5.0	Second, the worker who have different task can have extra  satisfaction from the out side of the work itself.
8.0	Every company wants to have more differnent task worker rather than hiring more similar task work, because the task from similar task worker can usually insteed by the robot and programe.
8.0	But the task from different task worker can not be replace by the robot cause it is too complex.
8.0	Therefor the worker who can do different task are easier t have a stable job.
8.0	and they can always get extra reword from the company.
8.0	that's why ht e woker who have different task can have more satisfied for work.
2.0	From what has been disgust above, we can easily reach the conclution that the worker who have different taskwill have more stis fied.
7.0	Because they can have more stable
3.0	I think it is a good idea.
3.0	Firstly, my parents did this when i was in high school, which turly gave me some power in a degree.
3.0	I do not think money is an evil thing which must be judged by the method and people who use it.
3.0	Everytime I got the money, i used them to buy books that I really wanted like The Three Body Problem.
3.0	However, my classmate would use it to buy video games that did deep harm to their studies.
11.0	So I think set money as a reward to children is not a bad thing itself, which must be used in correct ways.
4.0	Secondly, it is benificial that children have a chance to touch the money which belongs to themselves.
9.0	It pushes them to think how to manage their own things in an early age, which gives them a good chance to study many necessary live skills like accepting or rejecting.
9.0	Beside this, using money can teaching them how to choose independently.
4.0	THirdly, giving money as a reward is more pratical than other windy promise, because money can help children to do what they really want to do, but not their parents want them to do.
9.0	It also make them konw the importance of money, which they will meet inevitable in the future.
9.0	Only when the child got their want, did the reward meet its effect.
4.0	Last but not least, I do not know why some people think this is bad idea just becauese they think money is too social to children who will grow up in the end.
10.0	If parents can watch their children effectively when they use money, that nothing bad would happen.
2.0	Taking everything into consideration, offering school-age children money for a reward is a good idea which not only can make them happy to study, but also help them enter into society easily in the future.
11.0	What I believe is that offering school-age children money for high grade is not good.
12.0	Because of the money, students may try any way to get the high mark encluding cheating.
12.0	what's more,giving them money chang the purpose they study.
8.0	Without the money, they are studyingfor knowledge and theirselves.
8.0	However,they are studying for money now.
8.0	If their parents stop giving money,they will loose their passion for study.
8.0	And that may do bad to the students.
5.0	One of my classmates' parents do this,and he once cheated to get the high scores.
8.0	By cheating,he got an iphone.
8.0	This experience may lead him to a wrong way,which is surely not good for his future.
8.0	Compared with his parents, my parents never give me money for high grades.
8.0	I just study for myself,trying my best to get the high grades,but never cheat.
8.0	And I always feel happy when I learn new things.
5.0	Only in this way can a student devote himself to study.
8.0	The student can get happiness from getting high grades which stands for having a good command of knowledge.
8.0	The happiness will last forever, but the money won't.
8.0	Although the money can bring some joy,but the student cannot get the joy from leaning new things.
8.0	In that case, parents shouldn't give money to their children for high grade.
2.0	By and large,  giving money to their children for high grade is bad for children's studying.
3.0	There are many things to consider in terms of communication with people, different people have different ideas about this topic.
3.0	Some of them hold the view that using emails to communicate with classmates and colleagues have advantage over talking them face to  face, while others think that it is better for colleagues to communicate in person.
12.0	As far as I am concerned, I prefer to the latter one.
11.0	There are some reasons that illustrate my viewpoints.
4.0	To begin with, communicating with people in person is a great way to narrow the distance between two strangers.
8.0	This is because when we  talk to others face to face, the emotional connections are easily established between us.
8.0	Although it sounds weird, it does exist and is proven by scientists.
8.0	For example,  it is very common for people that their best friends are usually the people who played with them during their childlihood.
8.0	Why?
8.0	Because their friends communicated them many times and they experienced many anecdotes and unforgettable things.
8.0	In contrast, emails as a mean of communication is less likely to build this kind of friendship, since many people distrust online friends.
4.0	Second, communicating with people in person can improve your efficiency, which is important to work.
8.0	To illustrtate, many people may not check their email boxes everyday, which make it hard for people to get responds on time.
8.0	Taking me as an example, as a college students, I am very busy everyday and have a lot of works and assignments to finish.
8.0	Sometimes those assignments and exams drive me crazy.
8.0	As a result, I may forget checking my mailbox, which may miss some important information and notice from my classmates.
8.0	If they arrange a meeting and talk to me face to face, I will respond them on time.
4.0	Adimittedly there are some downsites about communicating with people in person, Such as wasting a lot of time and inaccurate express.
9.0	But  if we just fully prepare for this, it will not become big problems.
9.0	So I still believe that it is better for classmates to connect each other in person.
2.0	To put it into nutshell, my preference for communicating face to face that demonstrated by above-mentioned reasons and cases is due to the fact that can narrow the distance and improve efficiency.
12.0	As the develpoment of the society, people begin to care more about what kind of work can lead to a secure and successful life.
11.0	Some people hold a point that now it is easier for us to identify a job's prospect than before.
11.0	However, others argue that it is more evidently now.
11.0	As for me, I strongly believe that it is easier to identify a job today.
5.0	Firstly, we can look for tons of information on the Internet which enable us to have a better understanding of a specific job.
8.0	Nowadays, the Internet is much more convenient than it used to be.
8.0	People share their opinions toward one job on the Internet.
8.0	Your can have a total and wider horizon on the job.
8.0	As a result, you can know exactly what  this career's prospects are and then certainly identify what kind of career would lead to a secure and successful future more easily.
5.0	Secondly, the law is more strict now which is a invisible guard for our career.
8.0	In the past, many officer may do many illegal things because they may think that they can not be caught.
8.0	However, paper cannot wrap the fire.
8.0	There is a very large possibilty for the civiliens to take them to the court.
8.0	In this way, the is no guarantee for those officers.
8.0	These jobs seem to be wonderful and many would hold a point that those jobs can lead to a secure future, but as I explained above, it is just fake, like a sweet lie.
8.0	Then, it increase the difficulty to identify a job's security.
8.0	On contrast, it is totaly different now.
8.0	The job is exactly like what it likes on appearance--- the officers are not possibly to break the law, so this career is just as safe as it looks; the thieves are finally punished by the police, do this job is as dangerous as it sounds.
2.0	In conclusion, now it is much easier to identify what type of career would lead to a excellent lift because of the wide information the Internet offers us and the strict laws we have today.
11.0	First of all,I agree with the statement that parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.
11.0	I think it is a way to learn the life skills.
4.0	However,there are many parents do not think it right.
9.0	They may think it wastes of time.
9.0	They think their children can learn at school,learn from books,so they do not need to learn from mistakes.
4.0	As far as I am concerned,there are many things that we can not learn from book.
8.0	For example,the good manners,a good manner is the thing that we must learn from our life.
8.0	What should we do,what should not.
8.0	What we must do,what we must not.
4.0	I learn a story from a newspaper lately.
8.0	It is saying that there are many people applying for a company,but just  ten minutes  after the interview the manager choose a boy without a recommodation.
8.0	A friend of the manager asks how he can choose a boy without  a recommdation.
8.0	He says that the boy pick the book he put on the floor on purpose,and he give his seat to a old man and so many good manners.
4.0	From this story,we can see how important the good manners is!
8.0	But, I want to say that the good manners can not be learn from the books.
8.0	It must be learn from the mistakes.
8.0	If the parents do not let their children make mistakes ,they would not have the chance to learn the good manners and many other things which must  be learn from the mistakes.
0.0	And there many people who have really good grades but do not success in the end.
0.0	The reason is that their parents want they have more time to study do not let the have the chance to learn from the mistakes .
0.0	After graduations,many company and many relationship between people and people need we have the life experience which means the things we learn from the mistakes.
11.0	With social development, it is important to have a decent job, which means that you can have a better salary and life a better life that you desire for a long time.
12.0	Of these two options, many people want to choose different jobs so that they can step out of their comfort zoo.
11.0	However, as far as I am concerned, I'd like to choose a job that is similar to my parents' job.
4.0	Firstly, it is a desire for me to choose a similar job with parents' conversion.
8.0	As we all know, our parents have to face the tons of assignments every day and consider complex situations to make a proper decision, so it is hard for them to talk with their fellows during the work time.
8.0	However, when they go home, they can have a private time with me, and it is convenient for them to turn their brains off and talk about the problems and some fascinating experiences with me.
8.0	As time goes by, I am familiar with the job that the parents take and want to have the same experience.
4.0	Secondly, choosing a similar will build up a better relationship with parents.
8.0	Before I have a job, I spend less time with my parents than my friends, so my parents almost don't know what I'm thinking and feeling.
8.0	When I face the complicated situation in the career, I will search for help with my parents, which means I will talk to my parents with my experience and my career.
8.0	Hence, it is a good opportunity for me to build up a better relationship with parents.
4.0	Thirdly, if I choose a similar job, I will gain more experience towards parents.
8.0	For example, if my parents are doctors for many years, will gain a wide variety of knowledge about medical search.
8.0	When I have some challenging questions, I can ask my parents that other people have to use the Internet, which is time-consuming.
8.0	Therefore, I can save plenty of time and do more search and get the promotion.
1.0	In conclusion,  it is necessary for me to choose a job that is similar to my parents.
1.0	With this choice, I can live a better life which I desire for a long time.
3.0	There are many different way to relax ourselves.
3.0	For some people, especially for young people, they prefer to do exercise, such as dance, running,  and all kinds of sports, etc.
12.0	Otherwise, there are some people, maybe older age people, they prefer the quiet living way, like reading a book or watching movie.
12.0	For me, I am so intresting to read a book after a whole day's work.
8.0	By a good book, the magic power can be input in your body and spirit.
8.0	The books give us the wisdom to overcome per difficulties in your life.
8.0	You can understand and touch the thinking way of different people.
8.0	However you are disappointed, tired, or angry, reading a good book can make you change idea and out of bad temper.
8.0	The same function is for watching movies, which can make people play a different role from real life to movie life.
8.0	In the movie, you can imagine youre the hero of the world, that means no trouble for a real hero.
8.0	So, why we forcus the trouble you are suffering?
8.0	Hero means who can overcome all difficulity and help others from trouble.
8.0	If you find you have all kinds of change or varity, that wil be funny and relax soon.
8.0	You wil be not lonely, all the people in the book or movie will become your friends, and you can improve your spirit by reading the positive book or movie.
8.0	My experience is that when I am bad temper, I will go to see a tragedy movie, even I can cry in the movie theater.
8.0	After the crying, I felt better immediately.
8.0	Or, when I met the trouble in the work, I can find the peace and wisdom by reading, that like the medicine for my spirit sick.
8.0	I can recover from illneed to health in spitity.
10.0	Please don't hesatate to reading a book or watching movie right now.
12.0	In the modern world , an increasing number of students hold the view that they should do some  activities which are irrelevant to studying when they are learning .
12.0	I am a high school students that with the same habits.
8.0	Actually this habit is good for me sometimes , but in the meanwhile , it also have some    shortcomming.
8.0	Generally , i suppose that the advantage of this studying habit is far bigger than those shortcomming in following three statement Fistly , This kind of studying habits trains students the ability to solve two or more tasks simutaneously .
8.0	It is hard to concentrate on what you are doing when you are doing something else , for example , you may hard to concentrate on the homework when you are listening to music .
8.0	The working effeiency would be increase if the students can get it through .
8.0	What's more , those colledge prepared students are supposed to be well -roundes which must have this kind of ability in furthur career competiton in order to  Secondly , this habits can help students relax and maintain better conditions in further study , Those college prepared students are supposed to finish a lots of homeword that are acquired by the teachers , they ma be very exhausted when they are studying .
8.0	So listenning to music or other activities would help them release their tension .
8.0	They can not only release the study pressure , but also can get a willing to study by listening to some calm music or their favourite songs.
6.0	Finally, doing these other things will give them other knowledge of diverse field of study .
9.0	There are a lot of great shows , programms or other things in the internet which can trains them in different subjects with different knowledge .
9.0	For me , the tv series of Animal Kindom really helps me alot in the TOEFL test with the biological information that obtained in the shows In general , I hold the view that the students will benifit from doing some other things when they are studying .
3.0	With the development of technology, various advanced technological gadgets make the communications and connections more convenient.
3.0	A controversial topic has aroused heated debate: whether it is more important to maintain friendship with a small group of people, compared with the ability to make new friends easily.
3.0	Opinions vary from people to people.
3.0	Some claim that the capacity of making new friends is more signficant since the broaden social network make it for us easier to success.
3.0	However, I hold an opposite view that the ability of maintaining friendship with a small group of people outweights the ability of making new friends.
5.0	First off, old friends are more genuine and sometimes they are willing to sacrfice themselves to help us.
8.0	To illustrate, modern people are now living overwhelmingly hectic lifestyles since they need to earn money to cover their expenses.
8.0	It is much easier for modern people to make new friends since most the people are willing to broaden their professional network, even though they are unfamiliar with each other.
8.0	However, if they have exhausted all the worth of you, they will discard you as soon as possible.
8.0	In this case, such new friends are not worthwhile making.
8.0	In constrast, the small group of friends are usually time-proved, and they are more genuine.
8.0	When you fail, they will encourage, motivate and inspire you; when you win the victory, they will not take advantage of you and prevent you from losing; when you get astray, you will spare no effort on guiding you to the right way.
5.0	Additionally, a small group of people are more familiar with you.
8.0	To elaborate, your friendships has witnessed long time.
8.0	They are familiar with your habits, routines, and preferences.
8.0	It is more likely to have infinite topics among them, which is conducive to comforting you when you are depressed.
8.0	In contrast, making new friends easily does not mean that these new friends are familiar with you and share the same interest with you.
8.0	With time going by, you might gradually realize that most of them are counterpart to you.
8.0	Under this circumstance, the gap between yourself and your new friends will be expanded.
8.0	For instance, when I participated in the basketball team in Wuhan No.1 high school, I made lots of new friends through basketball game.
8.0	Unfortunely, most of them have all kinds of bad habits, such as indulging in computer games, escaping from school and conflicting with their parents, which interfered with my study.
8.0	Finally I decided to break up with them and continue to play with my small group of old friends, who are familiar with me and have a positive effect on me.
2.0	To put it in a nutshell, I reckon that the ability to maintain friendship with a small group of people overpasses the ability of make new friends easily.
11.0	In these days, there are more and more famous people, what they said can quickly spread among people and affect nearly everyone.
12.0	So, these sentences sre more important to teenagers or the elder people?
11.0	In my opinion, they have more influence on youngsters.
4.0	To begin with, young people is more interested in what are the calebrities' jobs or what their opinions of some career, because at this age, young men are finding what they are going to do in the future.
8.0	Just like they want become the same as the successful men in bussiness or sports or something else.
8.0	And famous people's words can affect their choices.
8.0	Take one of my friends for example, she fell in love with a TV show called Grey's Anotomy, which talked about some doctor's lives.
8.0	What Ellen said, who is Grey in the show, make her determines to be a doctor when she becomes an adult.
4.0	In addition, the famous people's words can make students find out what to do when they facing some problems.
9.0	For example, one dany, the teacher let the students to read the story of Yu Minhong, who told people that he have failed the college entrance examination for three times but finally success.
9.0	These words encouraged the students who do not have very good grade a lot.
4.0	Last but not least, because many people can always have the lastest news, and in recent years, almost  all the students want to fit in some small groups.
10.0	So they are going to concern about what their favourite stars said and share these to his or her friends, so that they have have a lot more materials to talk about.
0.0	All in all, the words of famous people are more important to youger people than they are to the senior citizens.
0.0	In todat's world, some words can cheer people up, and some words can destroy one child's life.
0.0	So it is important to choose which sentences we should listen to.
11.0	I disagree with the statement that take rest better than to exercise, because I think that when you spend time to play instead of doing exercise, you are wasting your time and also it is effecting your health.
6.0	First, when you are taking exercise, you will be getting more health than others.
9.0	Everyone need health even they have a lot of money.
9.0	"I heard a say from a book, ""When you die with money that is a shame"" the meaning of sentence is that people must be having health."
10.0	Also, watching a movie or reading book are not the only way to relax, you can walk and jog after dinner, they are also the way to relax.
3.0	In my point of view, to offer the school age children money when they get a good grade is a good idea.
12.0	To begin with, getting money when they get a good grade can greatly encourage them to study harder.
8.0	In the school, student might feel bored if they do not want to stude or they might think the tests or exams are useless, but that when they can get some money for having a good mark, they won't feel like.
8.0	Money can greatly encourage people, whoever they are.
8.0	If there is a student who don't like study, money can be a encouragement for him to study.
6.0	Furthermore, getting some money for high grades can make the students' life easier.
9.0	Money is improtant to everyone, since we need money to buy foods and other tools or something else.
9.0	However, students don't have the ability to earn money, so they cannot but something by themselves, they need to ask their parents to but for them.
12.0	I do not think it is a good idea for parents offering their children money because of their high marks in school.
12.0	i think those parents should give their children other presents to congratulate the high marks they have made.
8.0	In stead of offering children money ,letting children go out and enjoying the beautiful scenery of nature may be a better choice for parents to encourage their children to get high grade one more time.
8.0	Sometimes it is not very wisely to give children money to celebrate their good grades.
8.0	It may make children think that money is the only thing imporent in the world.
8.0	It may  let the children only fight for money in the rest of their lives.
8.0	It may makes children only happy for money.
8.0	Parents need to let children know the wonderful places in the world .
8.0	Parents should not let their children think that money is the most beautiful in the whole world.
8.0	They should let children know that :money is not everything.
8.0	Children need to enjoy the wonderful world.
8.0	Let children enjoy the beautiful scenery.
8.0	Tell us children there are a lot of wonderful things in the world.
8.0	In stead ,you can take your children out of house to enjoy theBecause of those reasons, I do not think it is a good idea for parents offering their children money because of their high marks in school.
8.0	Parents should let children know that money is not everything,you need to search for the wonderful things in the world by yourselves.
3.0	Nowadays people are more than willing to help the people who they don`t know(for example ,giving food and clothes to the people who need them) than they were in the past.
4.0	As society develops and civilization moves forwards,one would expect to see more and more acts of kindness between strangers.
8.0	We would all like to think that people are growing more compassionate as humanity advances.
8.0	However,this is not the rality we live in.
8.0	Compared to the past,I think today`s people are less willing to help people they don`t know.
4.0	Firstly more and more people live in big cities nowadays.
8.0	Big cities train us tostop seeing others as human beings.
8.0	We encounter hundrds of people just taking the subway in  the morning to work or school.
8.0	Most of them just fade into the background.
8.0	Others may stand out as obstacles: the person who doesn`t let you pass on the escalator ,  or the beggar who asks you for money everytime you`re walking home tired from work.
8.0	Most of the time we are dosensitized to those around us.
8.0	As a result,fewer and fewer people are willing to help strangers.
4.0	Secondly,people have t work harder for less money nowadays,so they`re much less willing to par with their hard-earned cash.
8.0	For one thng,there`s the recent economic recession--a lot of people were recently laid off their jobs.
8.0	Those that could find jobs often had settle for menial work outside of their preferred fields.
8.0	So when people strugglng to make ends meet are aske to help others,they may react negatively.
8.0	"In fact,I often see people lashing out at beggars on thw streets."""
8.0	I earned my money.
8.0	"Go work for yours."""
8.0	This tpye of harsh mentality probably stems from the financial difficulties people have been facing lately.
4.0	Granted,sometimes people today d demonstrate kindnes towards others.
8.0	However,this is only really prevalent in smaller communities where people are more familiar with each other.
8.0	For instance,the other day,I forgot to bring my wallet while grocery shopping,and the owner of the store told me I could just pay her back  later.
8.0	I am a regular customer at the store.
0.0	Peopletoday are dsedsitized to others.
0.0	Due to recent economic troubles,they`re also more likely to be only looking sfter their own interests.
0.0	Small acts of kindness may still be found here and there ,but only if people are least somewhat acquain
3.0	To find a niche in the society is undoubtely important events for everyone owing to the fact that job is an important and neccessary gredient in our life.
3.0	Life always associates with our job.
3.0	Therefore, what choice should we make?
12.0	To choose a secure job as soon as possible when it occure or wait for a satisfying job occure eventhough this is a long process.
11.0	In my opinion, I am in tune with the fact that do not take secure job right away, we should wait for the satisfying job.
4.0	In the first place, interest is the compelling power behind the happy life; therefore, we should choose a job in our interest field.
8.0	My brother, Daniel who is the love of labor for basketball, can successifully illustrate this opinion.
8.0	When Daniel face a position in the computer comany after graduate, he do not choose this job eventhough the salary of this job is pretty attractive.
8.0	Finally, he become a baketball player, which is his dream because basketball is the only thing he love in his life.
8.0	Eventhough the salary of this job is not high when compare it to the computer conpaney position as well as basketball players always injury in the games, he never give up and he always feel happy and satisfied.
8.0	He told me that enthusiasm is the crucial conerstone toward achievement and you will not feel tired and bored when you do a job you are interested in.
8.0	Therefore, waiting to a satisfying is what we are supposed to do.
4.0	In the second place, challenges are wealth experiences in our life; therefore, we can not just choose a secure job.
8.0	For me, when I graduate, I have an opportunity to work as a banker.
8.0	However, I give up this opportunity even this job is very secure.
8.0	I choose start a satisying business, to set up a company with my friends.
8.0	This is highly challenging because we face the massive work load and we need to do carelly budget about company's consuption and to address the contrasts between the eployees.
8.0	Nevertheless, I think this is exellent experience in my life because I learn lots of social skills and this work equipe me the ability to manage a team.
8.0	Therefore, to wait for a challenging job can enrich our life.
4.0	Finally, some people think that we can not miss the secure job because you may will not meet again in the future.
8.0	However, I totally disagree with this point.
8.0	I think that we need to spend time to strenthen ourselves rather than to get a secure job right away, which can generate more satifying opportunities in the future.
8.0	When my mother graduate from university, she just obtain two opportunites including banker and teacher; however, she was not satisfied with these.
8.0	Finally, she choosed to obtain the mastery degree, which definetily improve her work ability and expand her outlook.
8.0	After that, what my mother face was new word because she can choose almost every job according to herselve.
8.0	My mother's experience illustrate that we need to spend time to aim us rather than to get a secure job.
8.0	This way, we can hold fast more satifying oppotunities in the future.
2.0	To sum up, I suppose that we should to wait for the satisfying opportunity rather than to get a secure job because interest, challege and improving our ability is the most important thing.
3.0	With the masses' increasing affluence and the development of technological gadgets, people can have multiple access to any events no matter where they happen.
3.0	Currently, a controversial topic has aroused heated debate: whether young people today are more likely to invest their time and efforts in improving the world than young people in the past.
3.0	Opinions vary from people to people.
3.0	Some claims that young people devote less time and efforts in improving our world since most of them now are living overwhelmingly hectic and hurried lifestyles, leaving no time for them to concern about our world.
11.0	However, I hold an opposite view that young people are now investing more time and efforts in improving our world than young people in the past.
5.0	First off, the appearance of state-of-the-art technological gadgets and devices make modern young people have more approach to know the urgent things happing arould the world.
8.0	To illustrate, thanks of the convience of the advanced technology, such as cell phone, cemara, desktop and laptop, young people can attain the first-hand news immediately, as long as there are some people reporting on the websites, compared with young people in the past.
8.0	Then they can spare no effort on improving the world.
8.0	For instance, China witnessed a destructive earthquake in 2008, which deprived the life of millions people and  tolled down thousands of house.
8.0	After the news reported on the World Assistance Commitee, the wordwide people from different counries, culture and color have denoted all kinds of substance to help refugees to get rid of the demage as soon as possible.
8.0	In contrast, the congestion of information in the past make it difficult to make great difference on time.
5.0	Additionally, the gradually increasing awareness of working together to improving our common world triggers more people to deveto themselves to make our earth better.
8.0	To elaborate, it is common that modern people has realized the importance of cooperation, since only after each individual has indulged in some events can we adress the thorny global problems, such as global warming, proverty, environmental protection.
8.0	In this case, more and more people will devote their time and energy to improving our world.
8.0	For example, the environment has been constantly deteriorated, which is caused by the fumes emited by vehicle, forest exploitation, and water pollutant and so on.
8.0	All of these problem alarmed the young people that it is imperative to take some actions to prevent them.
8.0	More and more young people sacrifice their time, energy and appealing salary to clean and recycle the pollutant in the oncean, serve as volunteer to reconstruct the habitats for wild animals and work on the renewable and clean power to substitue the pastroline and natural gas.
2.0	To put it in a nutshell, young people today invest more time and energy in improving the world than young people in the past.
11.0	I totally agree with the statement.
11.0	Doing physical exercise will makes me even more tired.
12.0	Instead, Watching movies is the best way to relax, which I have been concern for years.
4.0	Firstly, movies are entertaining product, which it meant to entertain the audience.
8.0	The only thing I need to do while enjoying a movie, is sitting on my sofa.
8.0	In my opinion, watching movie is the easiest thing in this world.
8.0	With technology developing, I don't even need to use my mouse to do the clicking, instead, I have remote control by my voice.
8.0	Imagine that after I have been studying for so long, and for so hard, then I sit on the sofa, and command to my phone, wich connected with my computer already.
8.0	"I don't even need to unlock my iPhone, instead, I just yell loudly, ""Hey, Siri!"
8.0	"Play Batman vs. Superman!"""
8.0	How entertaining, and how fast it could be done!
4.0	Secondly, I am always tired about things that are out of my control, but movie won't do it in anyway.
8.0	Driving a car on the road can make me tired becasue there are rules to obey, traffic lights to watch, and bikes to avoid.
8.0	However, in the movie world, if I am not happy about what I am watching, I can just simpley shut it down.
8.0	Many people talk about horror movies, they say this genre movie makes them mentally tired.
8.0	I would like to say that, if I don't want the scary sence, I could skip the part.
8.0	Things that could be controlled in my hand, makes me relax.
4.0	Thirdly, watching a movie is a spritual tour, that makes me forgetting troubles.
9.0	Just like doing drugs, like marijuana, after I got high, I don't care about the bills to pay, F grades, girlfriend had sex with others, etc.
9.0	I can concentrate on the movie, and put all the rest of the things away, out of the screen.
2.0	That's how I found watching movie is the best way to make me relax.
3.0	Some againster claim that giving money to students for their high grade in school is a very great idea because , in some extent, it will inspire the students to study harder.
11.0	But in my opinion, this was quite wrong because there are a lot of considerable problems inside this plan.
5.0	To begin with,parents cannot control if their students' high grade is true or not.
8.0	Students will de surely happy after they know their parents are going to give htem money for high grades and will pay an effort to studuy hard.
8.0	But this can only last for a few days, because students who are given money are students which do not have excellent grades, and parents use money as a reward.
8.0	For sure, the grade cannot be improved in only several days or only two to three weeks, it obviously require a long time and high enthusiasm.
8.0	Most of the students lack this enthusiam, especially for long run.
8.0	At this time, students do not want to study hard anymore but they want more money from parents, so some of them may use fake grades to cheat their parents.
8.0	Teachers use common red pens to correct the paper, and it's too easy to change answers after the teachers gave answers to students.
8.0	It only need a little bit time, but students can get a big amount of money.
8.0	Nowadays, this has already became a useful way for stuents to cheat their parents and teachers.
8.0	So, in this way, parents do not know if their child's grade is real or fake, and this can also cause large problem for student's future habit.
5.0	In addition, students are too young and they are lack of the ability of money management.
8.0	Some middle school students which are only twelve or thirteen years old, they are so young so they may have a large amont of troubles in using these money.
8.0	For example, if a thirteen year old girl get these money, what should she do then?
8.0	How to deal with this problem？
8.0	She will think of storing these in her desk, of course it is a good choice, but what if she wants to spend it?
8.0	She can buy books, flowers, gifts for parents.
8.0	These are certainly good choices, but if she buy some make-up,whichis not suitable for her age or her parnts disencourage her to use this, her parents may regret in giving money to her.
8.0	There is actually another solution.
8.0	The parents can ask the child for a gift list, if she get high grades, they can choose to buy one item on the list for her.
3.0	Nowadays, how to success is debatable.
11.0	Some people think we should spend more time with others in order to be more socialable so that we can be successful much easier with people's help; While others thinks we should spend more time on study to improve ourselves.
11.0	However, I strongly believe that it is better to study harder and success with our own efforts.
6.0	Firstly, studying hard to improve yourself can make you walk longer in the future.
8.0	Although you might be successful in this period with your friends' help, you might fail with many situations--- you friends are leaving ; your friends dont't be so powerful; you need to change a job......
8.0	All of these can make you worse while be strong of yourself will not be like that--- you can show your unique and brillant ability to others wherever you are.
8.0	For example, one of my friends, A, is always spending her time on making a good relationship with other people while my another friend, B, is studying hard.
8.0	A successfully got a well-paid job with the help of her friends while B was still studying hard at school.
8.0	However, a year later, A's friend changed her job and without that friend, A quickly lost her job-- She was not excellent enough.
8.0	But B got into the company she like without any difficulty---That is just the two differences between two choices.
0.0	"It is true that with others' help can ""save time and efforts‘’ ， however, studing hard can make your time more meaningful."
0.0	When you think of the years of the past, you could remember the scene of studing but not just be greasy to other ‘big man’.
0.0	You will feel very enjoyable when you think of the years of your hard work.
0.0	Like me, Now I always think of the time when I do a great number of math proplems to enter the math competition and win the prize.
0.0	Iget such a strong feeling of achievement and satisfaction when I finally success！
11.0	I agree with the opinion that it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.
5.0	On the one hand,though the can do much on our body,we human beings enjoy not only the body's satisfaction，but also the mental comfortability.
8.0	The biggesr difference between we people and animals is the intellect。If we lose it ,we will become the things in our meals.
8.0	Also,there are many examples that shows that we human beings' biggest advantage is our brain.
8.0	For example, the musicis one of the greatest inventions in our people's history.
8.0	Without the music,maybe now we were just a race that can walk upright.
8.0	Or we could use the science weapons but we were also animals.
5.0	On the other hand,physical exercise cannot push our world step forward.
8.0	If we are still the animals in mountains and plains,now we could't enjoy all the advantages that science brings to us.
8.0	For eexample,Hawking is a disabled person,but he dreams about the universe through his brain.
8.0	At last ,he does much to our world,and push our science a lot far.
0.0	That's all my opinions for this statement.
0.0	But we also can't abondon the physical exercise,.
0.0	It has a lot advantages,too.
12.0	In such a highly competitive society, every different job can make great success in their field.
3.0	Even a food shop.
11.0	"However, people who live in the past are more common to dicide a certern career for a successful future, such as lawyer, doctor and teacher, and people are likely to regard these job as ""a golden bowl""."
11.0	From my perspective, I think people in the past were easily consider what career would lead to a better life.
4.0	To begin with, in the mid of 19 century, the war was taken place in everywhere of the world, so the doctor became indispensable.
8.0	The army need doctors to treat the injured soilder, so they can preserve more soilders from the battle place.
8.0	As well as the normal people need the doctor to cure te disease.
8.0	In a lack of the awareness of healthy, many more people are easily to get ill.
8.0	As a charactor to save people, doctors start to become a career that people are willing to pursue.
4.0	Moreover, after the end of the war, the life was became more peaceful.
8.0	And with the develop of industry, people who want to live well need to learn skills or knowledge.
8.0	So the teacher is very important in that time.
8.0	The chance for people to study is valuable, so did the teacher become scarce.
8.0	These situation lead a results that many people start to believe teacher is necessary and respectful.
4.0	However, the world has changed a lot in nowadays.
10.0	There is no wars and with the growth of the society,
1.0	From what we have dicussed above, we can conclude that people in the past was easier to identify the type of career in order to have a better life, because of the instability and the lack of knowledge.
1.0	However, it has become different in the current society.
10.0	Peop
12.0	Nowadays the question about someones personality has become a major matter of concerant of many people.
11.0	Some people think we can learen about a person from the books and movies that is person like.
11.0	But still have some people do not think that.
12.0	Form my persteictive, i vote for the ideal taht we can not learn about a person from the book and movies that thi person like.
4.0	Firestly, i think a person watch what kind of movies or look what kind of books can not reflace someones personality.
8.0	Such us if somone like look the Kung fu novels.
8.0	Then can we  konw he or she must be very strong?
8.0	We can not say that.
8.0	My uncle is like that.
8.0	When he was young he really like look Jin Yong' s novel.
8.0	But we he was robbed.
8.0	He just run far away.
8.0	Also if someone like the entertainment programme.
8.0	We just know he like that kind of programme.
8.0	Maybe in the job he is very serious.
4.0	And secondly, the books and movies, which insome sense are hobbies, may mislead us in judging him.
8.0	Hobbies can act as acontributing factor for us to obrtain the xeternial information of a prrson., butserve little in unearthing the internal nature.
8.0	The following evidence canjustify thi point.
8.0	In the word war two, following their leader Hitler, most officers of Nazi Germany possessde higt level of music taste.
8.0	So it did not refliact the officers is really like taht kind of music.
4.0	Taking into a account of all the factorsidiscussed above, we may reach the conclusion that judgong a person by the books and movies is quite risey and blind.
10.0	To know a person better, we are suppost to take more reliable ways in doffersnt situations.
0.0	All in all, we can not learn alot about a person from the books and  moveies.
0.0	We should learn someones like from the details in the real life.
0.0	Not from the books or  movious.
0.0	It have a lot of our subjective factors.
3.0	There are lots of discussion about whether parents should offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.
3.0	Different people has virtues viewpoints about this question.
11.0	When it comes to me, I will firmly choose to disagree whit this idea.
5.0	To begin with, most school-age children don't have enough mind to control theirself.
8.0	For instance they passes a small store after they left school, they may attract by the food which looks pretty attractive.
8.0	It's very dangerous beacause they can't refuse the attract by the delicious food.
8.0	Besides they don't know if this food are clean enough to eat.
8.0	Futhermore,money can affact their concept of behavior.
8.0	For instance, there is a children  his money is more than anyone else in the class then someothers may has a competition mind about he, which will sprand a bad behavior in the class.
5.0	Although parents offer money to school-age children ha many disadvantage but here is some points wo can't ignore.
8.0	What if a teacher ask their students ot buy a studybook for a class but some of his student can't get the money for their parents at once.
8.0	What should they do?
8.0	Besides offer more money as reward of high grade can encourage they have more power to study hard.
2.0	In coucluse, it's not a good idea to offer children money for high frade they get in tte.
3.0	As the society becomes increasingly advanced and complicated, entertainment plays a more and more important role in the life of individual menmbers of the society and in the development of the society itself.
3.0	some people like watching a movie or reading a book in order to being relaxed.
12.0	However, I have a different idea.
11.0	I strongly agree with the statement that doing phsical exercise is better than watching a movie.
11.0	there are some reasons why I feel this way:doing exercise can make our healthy,make more friends.
5.0	First at all,doing exercise can make our body more healthy.
8.0	Nowadays, the most of people have many works and school work to do every day.
8.0	Therefore, they too busy to do exercise.
8.0	For instance, my father is so busy that he have a long time not to do sporting.
8.0	A time goes on, he become fatter and fatter that he doesn't know the important of this problem.
8.0	when he go to the hospital, he just realize that he so fat that he has some illness.
8.0	After that , when he have free time, he spend all time doing exercise.
5.0	In addition,doing exercise can make more friends whose interests are similar with me.friendship is a significant part in our  daily life.
8.0	As my own experiement for example, I often take badminton class to relax.
8.0	when i join this class, I know many partners who are friendly to help me.
8.0	Therefore, i make more friends.
8.0	we often play badminton and do other sports together.
8.0	they usually make me happy when I feel bad.
8.0	I very happy that I have these friends
0.0	In summary,doing exercise can make our body healthy , let me make more friends.
0.0	From these reasons, I strongly agree this statement that it is better to relax by doing sporting than reading a book or watching a movie with friends together.
0.0	Doing exercies can make our society happier.
12.0	Pecuniary award,which is widely used among parents to encourage their children to study hard and do well at school,becomes a controvertial method during these years.
11.0	Personally speaking,I do agree with such intriguing means as long as it works.
5.0	There are lots of ways to get in touch with money since today is a liberal day,young children may gain money from their parents,relatives,or even  freinds.
9.0	No evidence has been exposed to the spot that young children will learn spending money on whatever they like,but at the same time,people are always wasteful when their parents don't know how much they earn.
9.0	People who have been exposed to money in their youth might be knowledgable about arranging their salary conversely.
5.0	Excepting the passion we have on the career,motivation is also essential for us to perchase our desirement.
8.0	As a student in school,what inspires me most is the praise and award from teachers and parents when I get a high mark.
8.0	The amount of money doesn't matter,but the feelings of happiness that counts.
8.0	After I owning the money, I'd like to study harder than before in order to keep the scores.
2.0	Actually,what are people worried about is that children will make an eqation between the money and their study,so that the meanings of books can eventually disappear as time passes.
9.0	I have to argue this statement that there is no need to be so confusing about this prevailing way of awarding.
9.0	O
3.0	With huge increase on human population, how to satisfy people's housing need is an absolutely important issue.
3.0	Should government to build new housing or preserve old and historic buildings?
11.0	For me, it is more important for the government to build new housing.
4.0	In the same place, building new housing which can include more residents can provide people affordable house to live.
8.0	For instance, in the past I lived with my parents and my grandparents in a small house in the past because that time the housing resource was limited, which made house's price pretty high and my parents had not enough money to buy a new house.
8.0	After that, the government replace lots of old and historic buldings, which increased largly resident rate.
8.0	Following the house's price had a huge drop and lots of people can buy new house.
8.0	Noweadays I live with my parents isolately because increasing number of new housing more people can live in causes the drop on house's price.
8.0	Therefore, government is supposed to build more new housing more people can live in since this can solve the residents' bais problems.
4.0	In the second place, building more new housing instead of preserving old and historic buildings can protect wild animals' living condition.
8.0	It is known to all that lots of government which in order to fullfill housing need without destroying old and historic buildings puts a lot of deforest program into practice.
8.0	In this way, lots of animals lose their homeland owing to the land fullfillmend and city expansion.
8.0	Furthermore, the appearence of some wild animals will bring huge unadversable effects on ecosystem.
8.0	Therefore, the government should replace old buildings with new housing, which not only can solve the need for more people, but also can protect environments.
4.0	Finally, some people think it is important to preserve old and historic buildings because they have histori value for next generation; therefore, the government should preserve old and historic buildings.
8.0	Nevertheless, I totally disagree with this point.
8.0	Although some historic and old buildings have value to appreciate, the government could onl preserve one or two buildings of certain buildings.
8.0	In this way, the government not only can satisfy our living need, but also can enable next generation to appraise these historic value.
2.0	To sum up, it is more important for the government to build new housing than preserve old and historic buildings because of positive effects on environments and availuable means to solve living needs.
3.0	I don't agree that people today are more willing to help the struggling strangers.
3.0	As we all know, there is a very famous and controversial example in China,which has caused  a wide discuss in all over China——an old man slipped in a street in Nanjing, and a warm-hearted man passing by stopped and helped him to hospital.
3.0	To all's surprise, the old man claimed that the passerby is the man who made him slipped.
3.0	What's more ridiculous is that the judge is the passerby should pay for the whole fee in the hospital with the reason that why you did help him if you hadn't commit it.
11.0	I do believe that the judge is one of the most shameful things in China,which makes all Chinese cold in heart.
5.0	The judge is like a symbol that the Chinese is getting more and more indifferent.
8.0	There is another example.
8.0	"An old man slipped in the morning and told who would help him,""Don't help me,just get your way."
8.0	"I have the medical insurance ,so it's not necessary to worry about me."""
8.0	Yes, it is a just little thing,but the media reports it for endless times.
8.0	That's just the phenomenon that the society is getting indifferent,isn't it?
5.0	One and another things make us colder and colder in heart.
8.0	No wonder people today are less willing to help the struggling strangers.
8.0	Despite of that,I'd still like to help people in trouble.
8.0	In one hand,if everyone take steps ,there is no doubt that the society will become nicer.
8.0	And in the other hand, the government is getting more better,and the relative laws is getting more reansonable,which will give the people helping others more protect.
7.0	Therefore, let's go and help ourself
3.0	Nowadays,people always look mobilephones on the bus ,subway,train even on the airplane.
3.0	we can choose more and more fancinating movies to see or we can find many text books on the internet.
3.0	these are popular in the society when  we have time to relax .
3.0	But we should think about the other way to relax ,Not only movie,books and games.
11.0	From my statpoints, relaxed by doing physical exercise is better than watching movies and reading.
4.0	First, doing physical exercise is outdoor activity.
8.0	we can find many friends which are intersted in playing baskerball,football,tennis .
8.0	we can easily to make  friends.
8.0	i think this is also the sections of realxing.
8.0	we can have many common intersts ,And next we can make schedule for our daily routine about our exercising.
8.0	this is a good habbit for us to balance our healthy and relaxing.
8.0	dong exercise is helpful for our body.
4.0	Second, doing exercise is popular in many countries like America,Japan even in China.
9.0	In many chinese cities like ChengDu,A plenty of citizens will choose outdoor exercise to relaX Themselves,This is a good way to adjust our body's memory,When  i live in Chengdu,i always go outdoors with my classmates,we can go to run for a long time When sweat flows ,we will feel powerful and cool.
9.0	After Doing aome Exercise ,we will choose a place to drink tea,this is a nice moment when  you extremely calm down and discharge ourselves.
4.0	Third, the reason whyDoing exercise is better than watching a movie or reading book is eye's protecting.
8.0	According to many results ,More and more teenagers wear galsses when they are in middleschool or high school.
8.0	when you go to the chinese university,nearly sixty percent of people wear glasses .
8.0	This is terrible result but it also point out that if we spend our leisure time on watching movie ,reading book.
8.0	we will have poorer eyesight day by day.
8.0	When the time goes by,we will lose our eyes forever,we can not watch the wonderful world ,we can not relax playing with our family members.
8.0	So ding physical exercise is helpful for our body,and also we should duty for our future.
1.0	Let us relax doing physical exercise than watching movie and reading books.
1.0	it wiil let you feel different about the world.
11.0	I think that it is not a very good idea for parents to offer their school-age children money for geting a high grade.
12.0	Mainly because it will make children get greedy and want money desperately when it is only a rectangle shaped paper to buy daily things or doing a action that is very deadly, showing off their own expensive stuff.
12.0	This might lead to one of school's bad headache, bullying because you they will show off and see if anyone who don't have the stuff they have and laugh at them.
12.0	Then they found there are people who have it too so they make a little gang bulling peole who don't have the thing they have.
5.0	Another reason I don't agree with this action because it will give young children a early idea of bribing which is very unhealthy and very bad.
8.0	Bribing is something parent should really prevent children from doing and take moment and think what will the children act if their own very parent is bribing right know.
8.0	Maybe they will just forget the idea and just keep going but what if they stop and think oh who cares I will bribe too with my friends since my own parent is doing it this very moment.
8.0	This is an very bad beginning for a young innocent child that had reach a step in this world that is full of danger.
8.0	And I hope all of the parent around the world would stop doing it to their children if their are still doing it right now.
5.0	Anyways what do high mark do anyways ,let you eat a big feast?
8.0	Maybe rise you from death?
8.0	No!
8.0	As people always said you can't judge a book from it's cover.
8.0	Isn't this judging a book from it's cover?
8.0	You can't predict your future just by looking at your once a while 100 mark score and say I will be very succesful when I grow up.
8.0	Can you do that?
8.0	You can only study brick by brick and try to be succesful at future.
2.0	In conclusion I disagree with the idea that some parent is paying their children money to get high grade in exam which will not actually encourage them.
3.0	It think it is a good idea.
3.0	As a student, how many points he has will be a important part when other people having a empress of him.
11.0	In this aspect, money is not so ipmortant than the life the children will have.
4.0	Although many people do not have good skills to communicate with others, What the best job for a person will be reflected by the grades they get in school.
9.0	We can easily know what is this man good at, and then have a simple express of him.
9.0	However, considering a condition, the person may gain many skills that are helpful in many positions in the life, how could people know if this man got low grades in school?
4.0	There is no doubt that sometimes it is more important to show what is the man looks like than to speak out what the man is.
9.0	It is not difficult to recongnize the abilities of the person when people have long time to learn about others.
9.0	And in most of time, people may just have a first empression, from the grades in school.
4.0	What should parents do when they know the fact that one day their children will finally get out of schools and have competitions with other children, especially those have more beautiful grades inschools?
10.0	For the children, parents, who love them so much, are eager to ensure the grades their children have in schools by offering their school-age children money.
2.0	Most of people may not have a stage to show their advantages to others but it is necessary.
7.0	Now grades is a good choise to do that
3.0	Nowadays, there is a tendency that parents are more concerned about children's grade got in school, with society's common thought that the grades may determine the future of the kids.
3.0	Consequently, parents raised various kinds of methods to stimulate their kids to study hard to attain an excellent mark.
3.0	Some parents offer their children, who is studying in school, money for their every great mark.
11.0	As I see it, I agree that it is a decent way to reward children's high score by money.
6.0	To start with, although rewarding for the high score of children may cost much from parents' position, it can be more valid and useful than other methods.
8.0	Children expect to earn more money because they desire to do a lot of things they like, such as purchasing some toys.
8.0	Because of their need for money, they will spare no effort to get a high mark.
8.0	To illustrate, when I was 10 years old, I worked hard realize my dream to rank NO.1 in my class, as my parents promised to buy a pretty doll for me if I could get the best score.
1.0	Futhermore, for money, a way of rewarding,when children think about suitable ways to spend money, they can cultivate a sense of saving money and they can recognize the value of money.
1.0	For instance, when I receive the reward from my family, I was thinking about how could I spend the money and I think it's false to waste it on something that isn't worthwhile, and IT
3.0	As the communication become more convenient compare with the past time.
11.0	I believe the ability to relate well with people has become more important than ever.
11.0	"Like a popular words""it's IQ insures that you will be hirded,but it's EQ get you promoted."""
12.0	In my opinion, finding a job won't be a problem for most of people, whereas it just a begining.
6.0	When you are working, you will have to cooperate with your associates and your boss.
8.0	So your studing ability won't be the most important skill that you are required.
8.0	if you desire for success in your job, that means you would have to promote into the layer of management.
8.0	because only in there you can exhibite your talent and skills.
8.0	And it will require some leadership and the ability of far-sight.
8.0	Therefore, the ability of communicate with other is the basic of your success.
2.0	It is ture that some people may become success even they are limitated in the ability of communication.
8.0	Like Newton, sometime people could barely understand his words because those words were too specialized.
8.0	But most people can't be such extraodinary scientist like he did.
8.0	so the communication skill are more useful to pubilc than those people who get blessing from the god.
11.0	In my opinion, the statement that the ability of communication is more important than academic ability makes sense.
4.0	On the one hand, only if you have a skilled communication ability, the others can kown your academic abilities.
8.0	The people who has a surperb academic achievement but will be nervious in talking always can not be appreciated by others.
8.0	That is the reason why i think communication ability is more significant.
8.0	For example, Guan,one of my roommate, whose studying ability is  absolutely better than me.
8.0	He has a better proformance at class and a higher score in exam.
8.0	However, he has a poor communication skill.
8.0	He find that it is hard to examplain his results to professor.
8.0	So that the professor think he might not finish his assignment seriously.
8.0	In this case, unfortunately, the professor has a bad  impression with him.
4.0	On the other hand, the person who has a excellent communication ability also show that he has a better all-round qualities such as self-confident and positive attitude.
10.0	And these characrestics is more important, having these characrestics ,you will have a better career.
4.0	However, I do mean that studying hard at school is useless.
9.0	The good academic ability is the foundation of of communicate well.
9.0	you can talk well with others, but have nothin
1.0	Generalli speaking, There is no doubt that studying hard at school and having a good academic ability is of importance.
1.0	But The ability to relate well to people is much more important than the former.
3.0	Recently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people: shoule government improve the safety or improve the appearence to attract tourists.
12.0	Some claims that the government is not supposed to do it because it is a waste of monet and time.
9.0	However, contrary to their view comes my perspective that it is government's duty to improve the safety and appearence to appeal to visitors.
9.0	My point can be well elaborated as follows.
6.0	To begin with, it can attact more people to visit there so that the income of local government will increase, thich means much used money can returned to the government.
8.0	To be specific, afier the safety and the appearence are improved, there must be more people in other countries being willing to take vacation there.
8.0	In this case, there is no denying that they will purchase many gifts or goods, causing the development of local economy.
8.0	while they are spending their money, they
3.0	The best way to arrange the workloade of the employees is always a question worth disscussing.
12.0	In an industrialized society, the work people do today is far from the work of the previous centries when agriculture still doinated the productivity.
5.0	At the begining of the industrilization, a fix work for every worker is preferred by the employer.
8.0	each worker will always finished the same procedure on a certain stream line.
8.0	The worker would repeat the same movement over and over again until he or she got off work.
8.0	Apparently, the advantage of this fixed mould of work is that high proficency can be reached and surely the factory will gainmore profit.
8.0	however the disadvantage is also impossible t negelect: workers were easily get injured in this process.
8.0	constant tention on the same musel can cause unrecoverable damage to the nerves.
5.0	therefore, to avoid the the health of the workers, nowadays employers tend to arrange all kinds of work for the same employee thus the employee can decided what they want to di first and have more freedom att work.
10.0	A multi-tasked work also makes thework less tedious and prevent the emplotees from being caught by bordom which may decrease the efficency of the limitted working time.
2.0	Considering what have been talked about above, most of the jobs today are required with many different types of tasks at the same time.
7.0	For example, the waiters in the restaurants usually are not only required to srve the table but also share the responsibility of cleaning the floor or greeting the costomers, this kind of multi-task mould makes the work less boring for the em
11.0	When people are young, there are many things waiting us to choos.
11.0	And if young people have no ideas to choose, they will ask their parents to help them.
11.0	At this time, their parents will tell them how to choose is better to their future.
12.0	There are two different opinions now.
11.0	Some people think today young people are better able to make decisions about their own lives.
11.0	And other people think that in the past, young people not depended on their parents too much.
10.0	In my opinion, i agree the latter.
5.0	First of all, in the past, there were less things to choose than now.
8.0	Because the technology is developing.
8.0	Just for students, when they face graduation, they should choose their major.
8.0	For example, when my mather graduated, there are only several kinds of jobs waiting her, like teacher, cook, doctor and so on.
8.0	My mother choose to set up a business.
8.0	But now, i will graduated , the jobs become more and more.
8.0	You can work for computer if you want.
8.0	And if you can, you can work abourd.
8.0	I do not know my future, so my mather askes me to become a doctor.
8.0	Because i will make a lots of money if i am a doctor.
5.0	Secondly, in the past a family has many children.
8.0	Sometimes the older teenagers will help their parents to take care of they brothers or sisters.
8.0	In this situation, they grows fast.
8.0	Just like my aunt, she is the oldest in her family.
8.0	Because her parents diedn when she was young.
8.0	So she had no idea to raise the whole family expect finding jobs.
8.0	She growed up very early.
8.0	But now, every family just has a singe children,just like my family.
8.0	So, my parents worried all days about safety, and they care about my future too much.
8.0	So they help me to do a lots of choices.
2.0	so, i think, in the past the young people are more independent.
3.0	The adults are under grate pressure due to the responsibilities of resing a child, but the parents have other things that bring pressure as well.
3.0	They need to provide shelter to the families, work in other to make money.
3.0	The parents are very busy, so they may not have enough time to spent with their children.
3.0	So it's always been a debatable subject that what is the best way to spend the limited time with children.
3.0	I think the parent should have fun playing games or sports with their children together by following reasons.
5.0	First, the parent needs to obtain a strong relationship with their kids.
8.0	kids need a place to be felt safe to unload their feelings, and the parents are the best candidates.
8.0	The studies show that the stronger the relationship between the parents and kids are the less likely the kids will develop mental decide like depression.
8.0	For example, I watched a documentary, it 's a story about a depression patient.
8.0	The patient name Ryan, he developed depression when he was in high school.
8.0	Lots of the patients commit suicide and lost their life is because they didn't speak up, sometimes the closest people didn't know they have depression.
8.0	Ryan and his father are both like football, even his father is busy but his father will always bring his son to watch a football game at a studio once a month.
8.0	Unlike other patients, Ryan told his father about what he felt like every day.
8.0	And eventually, Rayn has diagnosed depression and receiving the help that he deserves.
5.0	Second, playing sports can make kids more healthy.
8.0	we all need to spend a lot of od time in school, and we just sit there and not moving very often.
8.0	So and some kids get obesity and some even worse, diabetes.
8.0	It's all because of the laking of the exercise.
8.0	So we should take the exercise more serious than before.
8.0	My friend Andy is a high school student, he has obesity.
8.0	his families try everything such as ties and exercise too, but he will quite the jogging after a while.
8.0	And his father decided to run with his son every day, and he lost 30 pounds just 2 months after that.
8.0	so I think it's a great way to spend time with the child.
2.0	To wrap up, even the parents are very busy, they will always put their child first, and I think to spend time with your child by playing and doing sports is the best way.
3.0	In the high competive sociaty, grade is become more and more important both for students and parents.
12.0	So, there is a heaten discussion in the society recently about whether is right that parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.
11.0	Opinion may vary from individual to individual.
11.0	Personally, I strongly believe that it is a great idea for parents to do so.
5.0	To begin with, offering children money for high grade can help them build the desire for winning.
8.0	Nowadays, it's becoming harder for people to live in this world well with the high cost of different aspects of living, like food, house, car, electronic products.
8.0	So, it is great to teach the children the importance of getting good grades or they could not live in the society well in the future.
8.0	To appraoch this goal, material beneficial is a great strategy because gread cannot bring them real benefical except honour.
8.0	If we give the children the real prize, they would probably realize good grade can give him or her really benefical, which is they would know in the future, people get good grade earn good pay.
8.0	So, if they know this point earlier, they can motivate by this and fight for good life which is absolute helpfull for their future.
8.0	For instance, my little brother used to be a naughty boy and never took his grade serious.
8.0	Then my parents told him if he could get good grades he would get prize.
8.0	Because of this, he started to study with great attitude and yaers later, he entered a great high school.
8.0	So, offering children money for good grades can motivate them to win.
5.0	Secondly, offering children money for high grade can teach them to be a honest and progressive person.
8.0	It is obvious that doing something great should have positive feedback and with the hard work people will have great result.
8.0	offering children money for great grade can help children to learn, if you work hard, you will gather what you really want.
8.0	With this way, children won't consider to get something in a impropriate way and instead, they would struggle for the goals.
8.0	It is the best way for parents to give the children the prize.
2.0	To put into a nutshell, parents offer their chool-age children money for each high grade they get in school is a good idea becuase children could learn the importance of success and the right way to earn what they want.
3.0	According the development of the civilazation and ecnomy,more and more parents want their child could go to a good college with good health.
12.0	So they will try their best to make children to do more homework or  to do some sports.
11.0	However, I don't think it is a good idea because children's always have their own interest.
11.0	So let them to do their choice is the best.
6.0	Doing something they are interested, it could make them get achievement more easily.
8.0	If childern do something they want, they will practice more and spend more time on it and get achievement more simple.
8.0	For example, I just don't like the lesson in the general school, But I have to do so many homework everyday because my parents want me to do this.
8.0	One day, I said I want to go to the art school, because I love art.
8.0	So I just go to the local art middle high school, and practice everyday.
8.0	Finally.
8.0	I got the offer of the best school in these place.
8.0	If I don't go to the art school ,I could never get this kind of achievement.
2.0	Doing something childern want, it could builde kid's own mind.
8.0	If childern want something, they will think about it carefully, and try their best to get this.
8.0	And it could make them have their own mind rather than just doing something their parents want them to do.
8.0	For example, My uncle he had a dream of being an actor when he  was a little boy, So he will try to join some TV show ,
