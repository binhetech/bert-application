"When they grow up and get into the society,they will find it too much hard to get enough money to satisfy their need in their own life."	I_S0
"Then they can't get finance independent and continue to rely on their old parents who probably get retired."	I_S0

"For a long time, television as a public medium for human beings, has entertained people with various programs."	B_I0
"Without any shadow of doubt, whether or not we accept it."	I_I0
"Television, specially advertising , change the principal of human kind's contemplation."	I_I0
"With this in mind, some believe that it stands to reason that television advertising directed toward children aged from two to five need to be banned due to its negative effect, while others hold the opposite view."	E_I0
"As far as i am concerned, the first attitude three of the most substantial are discussed below."	S_T0
"The most compelling point is that advertising companies often prosent their products in an exaggerated manner, which leads to mislead kids due to the fact that children under the age five lack the ability to inderstand what is good and what is bad."	S_M0
"They believe everything they see around them; hence, they think whatever they watch on television advertising is true."	B_S0
"For instance, i had a cousin who is four year old, one day when he watched a television advertisin in which a small child managed to fly thanks th wearing a coat."	I_S0
"He, immediately put on his coat and started to try that stunt on his room window."	I_S0
"As a result, promotions have a dirct effect on children owing to the fact that kids are not able to extract the gist of advertisements, they believe what they just believe what they say."	E_S0
"Another interpretation why i do not concur with the latter perspective in the introductory paragraph is that promotions may cause waste money and emotional torture for parants when they fail to fulfil their irrational demands of their children."	S_M0
"Regardless of what is children's true needs, commercial companies aim to only sell their products, which are mostly useless or unsuitable for children."	B_S0
"They use colorful and fantasy promotions so as to attract children to demand those items from their parents."	I_S0
"If parents consider the products and find them kind of meaningless junk, they cry and insist on purchasing that things, which can make parants crazy."	I_S0
"Consequently, commercial messages may not only be unsuitable for children, but also bother their parents."	E_S0
"Last but not least, television advertising promulgates bad habits among children."	S_M0
"For example."	B_S1
"in order to promote junk food products, advertising companies often exhibit a fat child who starts eagerly devouring unhealthy food such as burger and pizza, which inclines children to unhealthy food rather than healthy one, changing their eating pattern, thus endangering their health."	E_S1
"To put it in a nutshell, having considered all of the aforementioned ingredients discussed above, i do endorse my point of view that the demerits of commercial messages directed toward students are more than its merits."	B_C1
"Therefore, i think that there is an essential need to revolutionize the legs regarding advertising and parents sjould keep their eyes watching what their kids seeing."	E_C1
 
"As we all know, human is a kind of social animals."	S_I0
"That not only means teamwork is crucial for us, but also means we could become more effective when we work together."	S_T0
"Thus, from my opinions, I will definately agrees with the statement that when teachers assign projects on which students must work together, the students learn much more effectiely than when they are asked to work alone on projects."	S_T1
"Firstly, the teachers often assign projects which are  complex and  difficult."	S_M0
"As for students who lacks of experience, they may  meet much more difficulties than they thought."	B_S0
"Because of that, students will often feel depressed and become unconfident during the project."	I_S0
"This is not good for their grow."	I_S0
"However, when students work as a team, they can encourage and comfort each other."	I_S0
"Take myself as an example, I used to be very unconfident when I deal with the homework of my Artificial Intelligence teacher, but some of my teammates encourage me and help me to become confident."	E_S0
"Secondly, we can easily figure out that students of universities often from everywhere of the world."	S_M0
"We could from different city, different province or even different countries."	B_S0
"We born and grow in different families and holds different knowledges."	I_S0
"Thus, when we get together and form a group to do a specific project."	I_S0
"We will have different opinions of the project, and opinions from others can innovate our thoughts."	I_S0
"Because of that, we can learn the project more thoroughly, this could help us learn more effectively."	E_S0
"Last but not least."	S_M0
"When we work on the project, we could be nervous and suffered lots of pressure."	B_S0
"However, when we work as a group, the stanger before can become a friend of us."	I_S0
"Work with friends can make us more relax and easy."	I_S0

"It do encourage kids to study hard, however, I don't think this way is very wise for following reasons."	S_T0
"The purposes of studying and exams are changed by this way."	S_M1
"People study for themselves, and through the process, they can harvest happiness or know what they are good at thus buid self-confident."	B_S0
"Money shouldn't be the final purpose to study, this will make the kids misunderstand the reasons for study and lose their way."	I_S0
"The purpose of exams is to check if you master the knowledge you learned before, and help teacher to know your situation on study then adjust teaching methods."	I_S0
"Using money as a kind of praise make the exams become tasks for kids."	I_S0
"In  some extent, they may get some pressure from this way."	E_S0
"If a children don't understand the purpose of sudying or exams, and his parents use this way to encarage him, he may cheat in exams to achieve the goal."	S_M1
"The kid may just want to get the money instead of learning something, so he may ignore how much effort he should put to learn well, and find a easy way such as cheating to earn the money."	B_S0
"My cousin Jerry was not interested in studying, so my uncle promised him if he get good grades, he will give Jerry 100 yuan as a gift."	I_S0
"Jerry tried to work hard and get good grades, however, he failed."	I_S0
"So he desided to cheat in the exam, and get the money, but this made him failed badly in a serious exam."	I_S0
"He can't enter the university and my uncle regrets a lot about his method."	E_S0
"According to these reasons, I don't think parents should offer money to their children to encourage  them to study hard."	S_C2
 
"In some countries, high-speed rail is welcomed by many people because it can carry passengers between cities within a shorter period of time."	S_I0
"Some think the government should allocate a large sum of money into such railway lines, while others believe that the money should go to existing public transport."	S_T1
"Supporters of building high-speed rail argue that new railway lines can help save commuting time despite the massive investment."	S_M1
"With urban areas expanding further, more people may live in suburbs or even live in neighboring cities, and this means a new railway line between cities is especially important for those who need to travel to and from city centre for work."	B_S0
"If there were not such high-speed rail, it is impossible for many people living in rural areas to commute in and out of the city every day."	I_S0
"Therefore, a significant investment in the construction of high-speed railway lines is justified."	E_S0
"However, there are also some opponents against such investment, myself included, and they think the funds should go to existing public transport."	S_M1
"One major reason is that high-speed trains are expensive and the same amount of funds can be used to improve most of the current transport, including buses and underground trains."	B_S0
"These are still the main transport by which thousands of people use every day."	I_S0
"Another possible reason is related to the demand."	I_S0
"It is reported that there are still a large percentage of people living in cities and a new railway line outside of the town can only serve a small percentage of people."	I_S0
"This means the investment is not a sensible decision."	I_S0
"Ultimately there would be not enough funds to run the new railway system."	E_S0
"In conclusion, I believe that although there are benefits to some people living outside of the city if high-speed trains are developed, the number of rural population is still relatively low and existing public transport is still the main choice for most of population and should therefore be the priority of the investment."

"The tendency that controling the public opinions and attitudes through the media can be transformed by improving the oversight networking."	S_C2
"As we all know, there are various elements and procedures throughout the whole process of existing media, the most overwhelming of which are the information providers."	B_S0

"On the one hand, critical thinking helps us exam the information and idea from the media."	B_S0

"Some people contend that government should spend more money on Internet access, it is true that people's life is attained to the Internet, the investment in the Internet access will help a lot."	E_I0
"However, I strongly believe that the government should spend money on public transportation, because that can help the environment and the traffic safety."	S_T1
"Firstly, spending money on public transportation helps with environment and health problems."	S_M1
"To be specific, the carbon dioxide will be reduced, that slows down the speed of global warming."	B_S0
"As we know, most public transportations use the gas as the energy source, in the procession, many carbon dioxide is produced."	I_S0
"If the government wants to decline the great amout of carbon dioxide, some clean energy source can get used, such as the electric energy and solar energy."	I_S0
"The devolpment of technology needs a lot of money, if the government give financial help to the scientists, the new energy source can be quickly accessible."	I_S0
"Thus the country's air condition will improve, the health level of people will incline too, so government can also save money in the medical field."	E_S0
"Moreover, traffic condition improves with the money with public transportation."	S_M1
"In other words, less accidents will happen."	B_S0

"The lecture completely refutes the passage."	S_I0
"The author concludes that there are not many benefits to using genetically modified trees."	S_T1
"First,the reading states that geneticallymodified trees are more resistant to hardier than natural trees ."	S_M0
"This under mines the speaker’s claim that the genes of ordinary trees are diversified, even in the face of environmental challenges, a small part of them can still survive, but the genes of transgenic treesare unified,If what happens is that genetically modified trees can't fight environmental problems, they will all die."	S_S2
"Second,the author argues that genetically modified trees produce more fruit, are more hardy, grow faster, and are more resistant to pests than normal trees."	S_M0
"This challenges the lecture's statement that there are hidden costs, too."	B_S1
"Farmers can pay more for seeds than regular trees, and the law requires them to pay companies everytime they plant them, It also does not allow the collection of seeds and planting of free trees."	E_S1
"Third,the passage says that  planting large numbers of genetically modified trees to meet the needs of the trees to be cut down, based on the characteristics of faster growth, could save endangered trees."	S_M0
"This is contrary to the argument in the speech that genetically modified trees do great harm to localwild trees."	B_S0
"The growth of genetically modified trees is very strategic, and they win the competition for living environment."	I_S0

"The diagram illustrates the life cycle of the silkworm and the steps involved in producing silk cloth."	S_I0

"Mulberry leaf is had by it as food."	B_S0
"After four to six weeks,the larva secret silk thread to pack itself."	I_S0
"Subsequently,cocoon formed in the next three to eight days,after which it becomes a moth in the following sixteen days."	I_S0
"This is the end of the life cycle of silkworm."	E_S0
"As for the production of silk cloth,at first, the cocoon is selected,and then it is put into a pot full of water and boiled."	S_M0

"Secondly, the government have policies to promote entrepreneurship, such as lower rates of loans and taxes, which makes organizing a company easier."	E_S0
"On the other hand, there are also disadvantages of self-employment."	S_M1

"When we have money,we can do more things."	S_T0
"For example, when a city has money,it can build more houses and make more schools."	S_T1
"Therefore,the residents can be satisfied."	S_T0
"However,it is also important for the government to develop other services in urban."	S_M2
"It is because that people cannot live without city services."	B_S0
"If there is only economic development,without there,a city will lack a lot of things."	I_S0
"Such as medicsl services,education,living environment."	I_S0
"In addition,the governments need to develop these in addition to economic development."	I_S0
"That will make life better for the residents."	E_S0
"Everything taken into account,in my opinion,goverments need to care more about what people want and both types are important."	B_C0
"They are interdependent and develop together."	I_C0
"While developing the economy,the governments also need to develop other types."	E_C0
"Because people want to have a colorfur and more convenient life."	B_S0
"It is impossible to build a good city by developing economy alon."	I_S0
"If there is no financial source,there is no way to develop other services."	I_S0
"So the government needs to find a relationship between the two."	I_S0
"Only if that government does both well can the residents life be more perfect."	E_S0
 
"Recently, with the development of society and economic growth, more and more people are discussing whether economic growth is the most important national goal or whether other development directions are equally important."	S_I0
"Some people believe that economic development is the ultimate goal of a country's development, while others believe that development in other directions, such as culture and infrastructure, is also an important goal of a country's progress."	S_T0
"As far as I am concerned, developments in other fields are as important as those in the economy."	S_T1
"Economy is the lifeblood of a country, as only by taking 
 good control of the economy can maintain the stability of the whole society."	S_M1
"The United States had experienced a great depression in economy."	B_S0
"At the beginning of this century, there was also a financial crisis that swept through many countries."	I_S0
"This not only led to the collapse of many companies, but also caused many people to lose their jobs and even commit crimes."	I_S0
"It can be seen that economy is of considerable importance to a country, and only when the economy develops can a country have enough capital to develop science and technology, military and other aspects."	E_S0
"However, in addition to the economy, other areas of development are also particularly important, such as the construction of emergency reserve and infrastructure construction, including the improvement of manufacturing industry, which are equally important to a country."	S_M1
"Take the outbreak of COVID - 19 for example, people can only stay at home to prevent infection, when economy has experienced a serious shock, but compared with other things, the life and health of the people is undoubtedly the most important, China's strong manufacturing shows advantage at this time, as a result of it, we have plenty of equipment to  produce medical material, in order to meet the needs of the response to the outbreak."	B_S1
"Without sufficient reserves, it is not just the economy that is affected。
  Therefore, for a country, economic development is the basis for progress in other areas, and other aspects besides the economy, such as manufacturing and the development of emergency reserves, are equally important."	E_S1
 
"Recently, there is a discussion that many museums charge for admission."	B_I0
"Opinions about this issue are vary."	I_I0
"As far as I am concerned, I think the advantaes of charging people for admission to museums outweigh the disadvantages."	E_I0
"Here are two mian reasons."	S_T1
"On the one hand, the money that museums eraned can be used to hold more activities."	S_M0
"If the museums are completely free, in addition o the government's aid, they may have few money to carry out different nteresting activities or exhibitions."	B_S0
"Most museums can only earn money through gate tickets."	I_S0
"When they have enough money through the tickets, they can add various forms of cultural activities."	I_S0
"In this way, people can get more information besides the museum it already have."	E_S0
"On the other hand, charging people for admission can let museum provide more convenient services."	S_M0
"They can offer people free water, comfotable seats, delicious food, and free explanation which gives visitors smoe detailed informations aboout the items in the museum."	B_S1
"When the museums don't need to worry about money, they have more time and energy to focus on the culture itself which is the essencial purpose to build the museums."	E_S1
"Take my own experience as an example."	S_M0
"When I was young, my hometown's local museum was free but it was so boring that few people wanted to visit it."	B_S1
"However, nowadays you can spend only 10 yuan to visit it in which you can not only know the history in this town but also participant in many exhibitions in the museum which can give you a immerse experience about local culture."	E_S1
"Although there are still many problems existed , they can be solved in the future."	B_C1
"All in all, I support museums charge for admission."	E_C1
 
"With the remarkable progress of people's living standard, people can choose their life style flexibly."	B_T1
"working only three days a week for long hours and working five days a week for shorter hours  are two ways for employees to arrange their time."	I_T1

"Convenience is the biggest advantage."	I_T1
"Notwithsdanding, there are still many people chooing usual five-days work, I am one of them."	I_T1
"because the five-days work can be more regular and efficient ."	E_T1
"Firstly, work five days a week is a regular way to work with certain rationlity."	S_M2
"Generally, we have to get up early if we have job that day."	B_S1
"And it will be accustomed to have a healthy circle."	E_S1
 
"A range of governments put economic at the first place in their development strategy, while some people oppositely believe that developing other field have the same importance as developing economic."	S_I0
"Economic progress is conductive to upgrade of international status and improving the nation wealth."	S_M1
"However, everything goes after economic may increase people’s work stress and increase the leveling gap, which has disadvantage for certain people."	B_S0
"On the contrary, putting other types of progress and economic progress together may make it harder to gain international reputation and overall national income, but it may have advance in gross national happiness index."	I_S0
"For instance, educational progress can improve civilization, environmental progress can improve the level of habitability."	E_S0
"In my opinion, balanced development in all aspects have greater significance than setting economic progress as the central goal."	S_M1
"Pursuing economic development while neglecting other aspects of development may lead to irreversible consequences."	B_S0
"For example, overexploitation of the natural environment, such as oceans and forests, in order to increase the production of certain goods is not conducive to the long-term development of human beings."	I_S0
"Even if the economy develops for a while, it cannot work anymore after the environment is irreversibly destroyed."	E_S0
"To sum up, balanced development in all area makes more sense than focusing on economic development at one time."	S_C2
 
"Maya was an empire showed a strong energy in history, however, it disappeared and people are still debating the reasons why it corrupt."	B_I0
"First, the reading section argues that Maya was overcome by Toltec in war."	I_I0
"In contrast, the listening disagrees with it."	E_I0
"There are two reasons for this."	B_T0
"One is that it can be dated back for too two centuries."	E_T0
"The other one is that it is not corresponding that Maya was at a war with Toltec, that is to say, it is not Toltec that conquer Maya making it disappear."	S_T1
"Second, another assumption is that the Maya, due to their admiring culture, faced an abrupt increase in their population and the crops were not enough to feed everyone."	S_M1
"However, the agriculture in Maya can feed everyone with crops in new methods."	B_S0
"The entire empire would not die even if there is not any crops."	I_S0
"So it is unconceivable."	E_S0
"Third, since the location the Maya people live was not the rainforest as it is presented as today, they might experience a long-lasting drought."	S_M1
"However ,the drought only showed to be existed in north Toltec and no evidence could tell Maya once faced it."	S_S2
 
"The stages and equipment used in the cement-making process and how cement is used to produce concrete for building purposes are illustrated in the below charts."	B_I0
"Before making the concrete, people must prepare enough cement."	I_I0
"The first steps of creating some cement is mix the limestone, clay, crusher and powder."	I_I0
"And than the mixture is delivered to a heated rotating heater."	E_I0
"Finally, the produces are sent to a grinder which can make the produces change into the cement."	S_T1
"People is able to produce the concrete when cement is ready."	S_M1
"The only step of making it is put the cement, water, sand and gravel which occupy 15%, 10%, 25%, 50% respectively into the concrete mixer."	S_S2
"As we can see, mixing is an important part of making cement and concrete."	S_M1
"Although the materials are not stubborn enough."	B_S0
"When people mix them, they become stronger than before."	I_S0
"So the concrete is a important part of building."	E_S0

"But some people do not have right concept of money, so even they own encough money, they still cannot live well."	E_T0
"Because money will accompany us for a long period, how to use it or manage it?"	S_T1
"I think it is necassary for everyone to learn to how to manage money at a young age."	S_T0
"First, teaching children how to manage money, they can establish right perspective about money, and it can effect their future life."	S_M1
"When children grow up, they will have a job and own their family."	B_S0
"In that time, they are individuals, and they must do somethins by themselves."	I_S0
"If they do not have perspective about money, they cannot realize earning money is not easy, so they do not cherish the results and their thier social relationship will have negative influence."	I_S0
"For example, there is a boy."	I_S0
"When he was youg, his parents love him very much."	I_S0
"If he wanted to buy something, his parents must answer his requirement."	I_S0
"But when he grow up, his farther have sick and spend a lot of money."	I_S0
"In that time, he did not realize the family's situation become feasible."	I_S0
"He still ask her parents money like before."	I_S0
"Even his parents explain the situation, he still cannot understand the meaning."	I_S0
"One day, he did not get money from his parents, he even hit them."	I_S0
"Afer that, everyone heard about this thing, and everyone do not want to make friends with him."	I_S0
"In the end, if we cannot tell children the righ concept, the results will be terrible in the future."	E_S0
"Second, this way can help children develop independent personality and it can become well rounded person in the future."	S_M1
"Because in this process, children can realize they can individuals and they are not belong to anyone."	B_S0
"When they realize it, it will understand in the future they need to rely on themselves to live."	I_S0
"For instance, my sister manage her own money when she was young."	I_S0
"Now she is a universty students."	I_S0
"But she already do not need her parents money, they can earn their living money by herself."	I_S0
"Because she always manage her money, she can understand earning money is difficult."	I_S0
"Thus, when her classmates still depend on their parents, she start to do part time job."	I_S0
"In this working process, she improve her social abilities, obtain more experience and expend their field of knoeledge."	I_S0
"According to this example, children manage money no"	E_S0
 
"People have different opinions about whether government should be responsible for the citizen's health care and education."	S_T0
"I believe that government has to ensure and improve people's well-being and pursue common prosperity with providing detailed health care service and good education environment."	S_T1
"On the one hand, since government imposes taxes from working people, they have a duty to spend money on improving citizen's live quality."	S_M1
"For example, government can introduce new laws or policies to enable everyone can see the doctor and purchase mediciens by only paying a small amount of money."	B_S0
"These laws and policies can benefit the iow-income groups especially, this is becaue that the groups cannot offord the fees of medical."	I_S0
"In addtion, government should construct more hospitals, especially for the tier level one city, such as Beijing and New York."	I_S0
"if there are no enough hospitoals, it could cause a problem that people cannot see the doctor in time."	E_S0
"On the other hand, education is an another important aspect that requires government to invest money."	S_M1
"Now the economies are becoming increasingly knowledge-based."	B_S0
"Skilled workers are needed for sectores such as information technology and engineering."	I_S0
"Therefore, government should improve the education condition, from primary school to college."	I_S0
"Ensuring people can experience a good education environment."	E_S0

"Thierdly."	I_S0
"the hot water will be pumped up to condenser ."	I_S0
"What's more ,the condensed water comes into turbine powered by steam."	I_S0
"The last  step is generate electricity,which is powered by turbine ."	E_S0
 
"It's not uncommom to see that many young students are dropping schools with negative thoughts on studying."	S_T1
"The reasons of such phenomenon are varied from each other and from my prospective,three aspects should be explored to illustrate the problem."	B_S0
"Firstly,the family backgroud is a critical element which would influence children's notion about the the importance of studying."	I_S0
"Some children in some poor countrysides of China once had the desires of studying and going to the outsides of  the world extremely."	I_S0
"However their parents may not think so."	I_S0
"For these people ,their acute problems are to live and feed the whole family."	I_S0
"They don't have the spare money to provide school fees for their children."	I_S0
"And they also regard the skills of making money are more uesful and realistic to knowledge."	I_S0
"As a result ,the children finally surrenden to the realism and drop schools."	I_S0
"Moreover,the students' inner reasons contribute to the problem."	I_S0
"They may not performed very remarkable in their academic scores ,for which they can't construct confidences on studying."	I_S0
"And the teachers and parents are fond to conpare one student to other students ,or compare their child to other children,which may cause the disgusting mood of students toward schools and studies."	I_S0
"To improve the situation ,some parents should change their notions and attitudes to knowledge ,some teachers should reflect their methods of teaching,and most importantly,the students should engourage themselves that Knowledge and study can change life ,and that everyone can perform very well in study through their endeavers and diligences."	E_S0
 
"At present days, there are two different opinions in that children need to be taught from parents in how to be a good man of society, and others acclaim that school teacher need to teach children to learn this."	S_T1
"This essay will discuss the merits and demerits of those different views."	O
"It is obvious that we can learn many projects in school, great teachers can teach us not only some compulsory courses, but also many skills in society."	S_M1
"First and foremost, most of teachers in school are responsible."	B_S0
"For instance, students who can't figure out some problems, teachers will tell them how to solve those in any time, even the problems in society."	I_S0
"If we have the bad relationship with our classmates, they will also teach us some useful skills in communication with them which can be used in the future in society."	I_S0
"On top of that, teachers in school are specializing in education, therefore, many teachers know that how to teach students some knowledge in details and let them understand, whatever how naughty children they are, brilliant teachers always have the way to make them be better in lots of aspects."	E_S0
"On the other hand, there are still many individuals argue that parents teach children to be good in society which is better than school education."	S_M1
"To start with, children spend much of their time to stay with their parents, that means parents are familiar with children, in other words, they know what kind of person that their children will become in the future, thus they can use some closer methods to explain how to live in society and get along with others which some teachers won't."	B_S0
"For example, parents maybe will choose to share their experiences when they are young to their children, however, some teachers wouldn't like to share because of the privacy."	I_S0
"What is more, there are so many kinds of parents in this world, but they have a common ground which is they love their children deeply and more than everything just like an old saying that goes like that, there is no place like home, then parents will try their best to teach their children and make sure they won't get hurt in society, so children will study more than in school."	E_S0
"To conclude, from my view point, I assert that parents should teach children and I am sure that they will enjoy to be a tutor in society and life, so children can get more benefits than school education."	S_C2

"It is true that few language can make life easier, although we need pay for it with several languages died out."	S_I0
"In the earth, creators need alive, especially ourselves."	S_M1
"No one want to die with giving our wife and children to others."	B_S0
"On the face of society, we can easily find the majority of people struggle for their lives by working hard and learning more and more extra languages."	I_S0
"May be you are the one of them."	I_S0
"How much time did it cost you?"	I_S0
"It is not difficult to image that you spent much time or almost several years to learn certain languages instead of staying home with your families."	I_S0
"Meanwhile, many youngsters make effort for it like you, as a result ,you lost the opportunities at last because the older age than them."	I_S0
"Comparing with the length of time of learning more and more languages, Life is short, we prefer to use it at home."	E_S0
"Does it important to us to protect other several dying languages?"	S_M1
"For my opinion, it does not."	B_S0
"Because our money is limited."	I_S0
"In the world, many people are starving ,we could invest money to supply food and medical tings to them to make them alive or live easier."	I_S0
"Because i consider people's lives and the qualities of life are more important than languages."	I_S0
"For another, if our limited fund can be used in our country to give us much time to have rest, i think you would support me ."	E_S0
"It is clear then that what we might do today may be to make sure ourselves live a easier life and help other extreme poor man keep going."	S_C2
 
"I don't think I can agree to this statement, for the following three reasons."	S_T0
"First, I think children, under the most circumstances, do not have much time staying out of their home and learn from others, thus the influence the get outside is not comparable to what the have with their family."	S_M0
"For me, I can only attribute the credit for my growth to my family for their guidences during my childhood time."	B_S0
"When going to kindergarten or elementary school, most of the time I spend was playing around or reading books."	I_S0
"In fact, very little communication with meaning occured."	I_S0
"In addition, if the language and behavior of classmates and teachers confuses me, I will ask my parents to explain it to me in time, so my parents have much more influences on me than others."	E_S0
"Second, In kindergarten or elementary school, there are many students in a class, and the teacher cannot take care of the feelings of every classmate."	S_M0
"But our parents only have us to take care, so they can help us with every problem we have or notice our every emotions in time."	S_S2
"Last but not the least, I think that at home, because parents and child are connected by blood, they have natural trust and admiration for our parents, and we will involuntarily imitate their behavior."	S_M0
"Therefore, parents have a greater impact on us."	S_S2
"In summary, from the time spent with children and the degree of attention, parents are better than the outside world."	B_C1
"Therefore, the impact on children is greater, in addition, some precepts and examples of factors also lead to the conclusion."	E_C1
 
"The charts show an average Australian household energy and greenhouse gas emissions."	B_I0
"The first chart below shows how energy is used in an average Australian household."	E_I0
"The second chart shows the greenhouse gas emissions which result from this energy use."	S_T1
"From the first chart we can get it easily that the two main household energy use are heating and water heating , costing 42% and 30%."	S_M1
"There are other appliances such as refrigeration,cooling systeams and lighting."	S_S2
"And from the other chart we know that the greenhouse gas is mostly cause by water healing and the other appliances,following by heating and refrigeraion."	S_M1
"The cooling systems and lighting only cost no more than 10%."	S_S2
"We can conclude that the water heating is using the most energy as well as producing the most greenhouse gas emissions."	S_C2
"If we want to deal with the high energy cost and large greenhouses gas emissions , we are ought to start with water heating."	B_S0
"Refrigeration also cost a lot energy and produce many greenhouse gas emissions."	I_S0
"However ,although heating cost a lot energy,it only produce a little greenhouse gas comparing to others."	E_S0
 
"I think it need to be fostered children discrimination ability, at the same time, I also in favor of some punishment if the child is doing well."	S_T1
"Many people are not developing portable capabilities from an early age, leading to the future on the wrong path."	S_M0
"Perhaps what they think is wrong is not the same as what they think of."	B_S0
"ButThe purpose of education is not punishment, punishment is for the purpose of education with a means of education."	I_S0
"In today's education teaching, some teachers will be punished as the purpose, in order to punish the punishment, ignored the connotation and significance of punishment, the confusion of punishment and the relationship between the corporal punishment, freedom, and rewards."	I_S0
"Therefore, based on the perspective of education and the connotation of the punishment of several related concepts for analysis research."	I_S0
"Educators must be clear punishment and reward is complementary in the process of education of two means of education, the prize has fine parallel dual mechanism, so as to promote the students' learning."	E_S0
""Sticks out under a son" we are very familiar with this sentence, which contains the concepts of education, including can't spoil children too much, must strict discipline to let the child know filial piety, the strict discipline mainly refers to the corporal punishment, namely the elderly have the right to corporal punishment to the students"	B_M0
"Especially the parents and teachers."	E_M0
"To give students reward is to advocate a positive way of education, and the punishment should not be ignored, educators need to objectively look at one of the means of education punishment punishment."	S_S2

"In these days, many students do not want to study."	S_T1
"This phenomenon makes parents very nervous."	B_S0
"So why this phenomenon happen causes a hot topic."	I_S0
"In my opinion, I think the reason why students do not want to study is that more pressure come to them;teachers always think they are not goo enough so that they begain do not believe themshelves."	I_S0
"Firstly, in China all the people know that there are unfair to students in some provints like Hubei provint."	I_S0
"The students who live in Hubei provint have 560 greads they still can not go to Qinghua univercity, but the students who live in Beijing have 450 greads they can go to Qinhua univercity."	I_S0
"The students can not deal with the strong pressure so that they may choose do not go to study, because they think they study hard but they still can not get a good reasult so they give up."	I_S0
"Secondly, most teachers want their students can be better than other students so they always think their chirdren are not good enough, they should study more."	I_S0
"The one more thing is most teachers like to do they always like to compare their students to other students."	I_S0
"This acitions will make students think they are not good."	I_S0
"Make their students miss themshelves and some students will chose fight with their teachers, do not listen to them."	I_S0
"If their teachers ask them go to study they will not listen."	I_S0
"All in all the reason why these days students are leaving schools with negtive thoughts on studying."	I_S0
"We can not put all mistakes on students, auldts also should find mistakes by themshelves."	E_S0
 
"There has been an incresing rendency that more and more prople could enjoy a longer life because of developed medical treatment."	S_T0
"While it may bring some moral and ethical problems, I still believe that the benefits of this development could outweigh its shortcomings."	S_T1
"Admittedly, It is true that with the more and more longer life expantancy, our familes, societies and even countries are confronted with unprecedented challenges and difficulties."	S_M1
"From a personal perspective, working adults have to take more pressure and burden to protect their family integrity since they not only need to care about their own child but also ought to look after the elferly."	B_S0
"On the governments' level, they are responsible to allocate more financial resourses and assistance payment to ensure those old people's life."	I_S0
"Also, governments have to issue related policies and regulations to guarantee the effective implementation."	E_S0
"However, I argue that the advantages of this tendency could outweigh its drawbacks and the reasons are as followed."	S_M1
"First, the longer life expectancy is a symbol of the development level of economy and medical care."	B_S0
"With the growing lifetime, people could gain a happy and harmonious elderly life after working so hard during their first half of their lives."	I_S0
"Another contributing factor is that elderly people always play a significant role in a family."	I_S0
"People who still have their parents can maintain a positive family atmosphere and keep a firm connection with each family member, vice versa."	E_S0
"In conclusion, although the increasing lifetime could bring a large number of problems, we should recognize its benefits."	S_C2
 
"The vairety of language is shrinking at a surprising speed nowadays."	S_I0
"It is claimed that fewer languages enable interpersonal communication to be easier."	B_T1
"It is true that with the decline of languages types, there is no need for people to be exposed to different kinds of languages which may render the communicational difficulties, but I believe that languages are valuable cultural heritage and that any language vanished will be a huge loss on human history."	E_T1
"In today's society, it seems that English is considered an international language around the world and a good master of English can become a competitive edge for people wherever they go."	S_M2
"Therefore, some people hold the view that there is no need to protect the languages used rarely, especially in some remote areas such as Amazon rain forests in South American."	B_S0
"However, this saying overemphasizes the communicational function of language and ignores the meaning of cutural inheritance."	I_S0
"The phenomenon of language extinction is a symbol that the nation behind a certain language is vanishing irreversibly."	I_S0
"In my opinion, people in current society should spare no effort to protect the vanishing language just the identical way they do for saving endangered species."	E_S0

"People have conflicting views about whether raising the price of petrol is the best way to fogure out the problems of heavy traffic and pollution."	S_T1
"From my perspective,I agree with view that increasing the price of petrol can solve the problem to some extent."	B_S0
"The main reason is that if the price of petrol rise,a majority of people may give up using private cars due to the high cost of fuel."	I_S0
"In this case,the quantity of moving cars on road will decline,which is beneficial to getting rid of traffic congestion."	I_S0
"Another important contributing factor involves that less private cars also means less emission of exhaust like carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide,which will lead to greenhouse effect or acid rain."	I_S0
"However,this solution is not realistic in every aspect."	I_S0
"First of all,with the petrol price going up,price in other fields will also climb,which may make the economy fluctuant."	I_S0
"Furthermore,it would bring trouble to those who have to drive cars for the sake of work."	I_S0
"As far as I am concerned,there are lots of methods to solve this problem."	I_S0
"To begin with,people can develop cheaper and cleaner energy like solar power and nuclear power to take place of traditional petrol."	I_S0
"Cars with hybrid engine or electric cars are also uesful to relieve the pollution."	I_S0
"In addition,the government can impose restriction on the number of cars based on car license."	I_S0
"or a new way called car-pooling,which means several people can share a car if they are going to the same place."	I_S0
"Last but not least,using sharing bicycles is also a sensible and environmentally friendly measure."	I_S0
"In summary,increasing the price of petrol is an effective way to solve the problem of growing traffic and pollution but not the only way."	I_S0
"It is of great significance to conserve resources and protect the environment ,and under no circumstances shall people ignore the development of new energy."	E_S0
 
"Recently, the controversial topic has aroused a heated debate: during economic crisis, which one the goverment should reduce: library, police or public transportaion?"	B_I0
"The opinion varies from person to another."	I_I0
"Some claim that library should be cut down, others hold the view that the police is less imporant than other choice, so that it should be reduce."	E_I0
"However, contrary to their view my comes my perspective that pubic transportation should be reduced."	B_T0
"My reasons are elaborated as follow."	E_T0
"Firstly, the goverment has to distribute various money to make sure the transportaion in the good condition."	S_M1
"Because comparing with the private transporation, such as car, choosing the public transporation is able to save a lot of money and prevents the people from the heavy traffic."	B_S0
"So more and more people prefer to take the public transportation in the daily life, which cause the unavoidable damages and consumption of the public facilities."	I_S0
"In order to repairing the equipments, the goverment has to afford a heavy burden, leading to a unavaliable budget during economic crisis."	I_S0
"For example, in my homwtown, many worker choosed to take a bus to the hill because of the cheeper prise."	I_S0
"After a long time use, the bus was in the bad conditon: some chairs were borken, the glasses was full of dust, and the max speed of the bus apparently slowed down."	I_S0
"So the goverment spends many money to repair and update these buses, which makes the government has no money to build a new city park."	E_S0
"By contast, the library and the police play a vital role in the urban city, espacially during economic crisis."	S_M1
"library could preserve a lot of resourses, which is helpful for peolple to acquire the useful information."	S_S2

"I go along with this idea, and I esteem this is a benefit to students; they can acquire many things from this."	S_T0
"I think volunteering is a good way to develop the ability of students."	S_M0
"When the student volunteers they can find confidence."	B_S0
"For example, when they finish work successfully, the partner will give them thanks and encouragement; they can get sense of achievement."	I_S0
"In addition, they can boost their ability of expression."	I_S0
"For instance, they need to talk with other people while they work, so they can improve this capability very quick."	I_S0
"Moreover, their organisation capability will have a big enhancement."	I_S0
"For example, they have to arrange some things, and sometimes they need to introduce the work to a newbie; they need to teach everything to newbie."	I_S0
"Thus, they oblige to learn about and organize everything firstly."	E_S0
"In my opinion, volunteering is a decent experience for everyone."	S_M0
"The student can learn how to help other people."	B_S0
"For instance, when the people are coming, they need to give people help, and they will know the significance of aiding others."	I_S0
"On the other hand, they can obtain work experience."	I_S0
"A lot of companies pay attention to the work experience of applicants, and volunteering is a kind of work experience; it is crucial for the student in the future."	E_S0
"As far as I am concerned, volunteering is a benefit to society."	S_M0
"This experience can enhance the quality of people."	B_S0
"For example, the student can learn lots of positive things while they volunteer, and they can have an execllent change."	I_S0
"Above all, this way can save labor costs, because today labor costs are very expensive, through this method we can save lots of money."	E_S0
"Overall, I believe volunteering is plummy for students, and through this way they can boost their capability and gain some substantial experience."	B_C1
"Meanwhile, it helps the society, hence, we should agree the school ask students to volunteer."	E_C1

"In my opinion, this is a very serious problem of the modern society."	E_T0
"Media is a major source of information, and it can be the only source for many people."	S_M1
"Media can provide misleading information, which may be believed by people."	B_S0
"They can choose to report partial facts rather than the entire facts to gain advantages."	I_S0
"The media can easily manipulate the information and therefore control people’s opinion."	I_S0
"The media is simply much more powerful than ordinary people."	I_S0
"But isn’t there anything we can do to change the situation?"	E_S0
"The government can propose a strict regulation to the media, and the media can only operate within the regulation."	S_M1
"The government can also have their official media to report unbiased information."	B_S0
"Then people can have a reliable source of information and not worried about being controlled."	I_S0
"The people themselves also need to acquire information from different source, and get a whole picture of the information."	I_S0
"When people have the correct information, then they will have their own original ideas and opinions."	E_S0
"At last, media should be serving the people rather than controlling the people."	B_C1

"The most significant goal for a country has always been a spot issue, with confilicting views."	B_I0
"Many governments hold the view that the economic progress comes first while there are also a large number of critics believing that other types of progress are of vital importance."	E_I0
"From my own perspective, both economic development and other forms of progresss matter, between which I tend to the latter."	S_T0
"A wide range of reasons why the authorities focus on economics can be seen."	S_M1
"On the first place, healthy economic progress and adequate social wealth are the foundation of a safe and strong country."	B_S0
"As we can see, through the history only those dynasties which aimed at healthy economic progress left us glamorous cultural heritage such as Tang and Song Dynasty, which are just the evidence of a stunning country."	I_S0

"Those countries located in desserts would be the best example."	I_S0
"Although they are short of water by nature, their wealth provides them with the ability to convert the sea to water that human can drink."	E_S0
"Some other people claim that other types of progress  matter, too."	S_M1

"The robust demand for the working age caused population boom."	I_S0

"I strongly disagree with the opinion that school-age children should get money from their parents if they get a high mark."	S_T0
"Maybe it is a common phenomenon in today's society, which leads to many negative influences in the children's future and even the whole family."	S_T1
"I hold this view because of the following twe reasons,"	O
"First and foremost, I think it will develop a bad habit for the children since they always get material rewards from their parents."	S_M1
"They may take is for grant that they can get reward every time they perform well, which is totally unrealistic in their future life."	B_S0
"When they get into the society, they may realize that no one will appraise they even they finish something excellent."	I_S0
"Then there be a chance for they to give up easily since the material rewards used to be their only stimular."	I_S0
"They can get frustrated and negative when they cannot receive anything."	I_S0
"And  it is easy to conclude that these people are nor likely to succeed in the future."	E_S0
"What's more, I do think that the best stimular for children's study is the interest instead of materials."	S_M1
"They will persist to learn something only if they are truely into it, and absolutely money or other material thing can get them nowhere."	B_S0

"So I practiced piano eveyday after school and I felt truely happy when I was taking piano class."	I_S0
"It is a process of doing something you enjoy."	I_S0
"I believe I can never get that kind of feeling if my mother forced me to learn and gave me some money when I could play a new song."	I_S0
"I am so thankful for my mother's way of education."	I_S0
"Thus I am not approved of some educational ways which is just reward some material things."	E_S0
"I recommond all of the parents can educate their children with their heart and encourage these kids to learn something they like."	B_C1

"On top of that, scientists are able to have more chances to do some research on nature directly, and tourism means a method of raising funds for research."	I_S0
"As we all know, because of the discover made by scientists in Antarctic, people gradually realize the problems of global warming."	I_S0
"Besides, had we been to Antarctic, biologists would have no chance to research on the emperor penguin."	I_S0

"Even the minimal distance from every man to a penguin is set."	I_S0
"Therefore, there is no worry about environmental damage."	I_S0

"Recently, waste recycling has become a heated topic among people."	B_I0
"Some claim that boosting recycling in terms of morality is enough for us, while others argue that the only method to increase recycling is to make it a legal requirement."	I_I0
"From my perspective, no matter viewing this problem from the aspect of creditbility or effectiveness, I totally agree with the latter notion."	E_I0
"On the one hand, rather than propaganda again and again to build up the habit of recycling, legislation is an easier way to raise the awareness of it, even if people aren't used to it in the beginning."	S_M1
"Taking Shanghai in China as an example."	B_S0
"In 2018, it was made a legal responsibility to sort different kinds of trash before disposal."	I_S0
"With the efforts of workers beside the trashbins, it took just a few months for the residents to get used to the new rules, and the recycling rate increased."	I_S0
"Now other big cities such as Guangzhou, Beijing are considering taking Shanghai as an example to formulate their own rules of recycling."	E_S0
"On the other hand, as for the effectiveness, legislation greatly advantages moral propaganda on recycling."	S_M1

"On the contrary, no realistic punishment are performed when people don't recycle without laws."	I_S0
"As a result, the recycling won't last too long, and most people will tend to ignore it."	E_S0
"In a word, only legislation with other necessary kinds of actions can truly achieve the recycling goal."	S_C2

"Nowaday, there are lots of student's atitude of study are not positive."	S_T1
"It has two reason why they don't want to study."	B_S0
"Firstly, there are many bad temptation in front of them."	I_S0
"For example, the video game."	I_S0
"People are addicted to game easily,espacially the students."	I_S0
"They didn't have the self-control."	I_S0
"When they are addicated, every things cannot above the game, it is fill of their headd."	I_S0
"How can they study well?"	I_S0
"Also, for play games, they ssacrifice the sleeping time."	I_S0
"It will cause they feel sleepy in the morning, they will be sleepy on the class."	I_S0
"The bad temptation is the biggest problem."	I_S0
"Secondly, there are a large pressure form their family."	I_S0
"Most of the family want their children have a greatful future."	I_S0
"So they want to their child has a great grade in the school,but the things is, whether the child is happy or not."	I_S0
"They always do what they want to do without thinking about the feeling of child."	I_S0

"Waste recycled seems to be an increasing widespread problem ."	B_I0
"Some people hope government to make a legal to relax the household waste issue ."	E_I0
"It is true that law could help people to recycle ."	S_T0
"Theoretically , recycling legal would effectivly limit people's behavior ."	S_M1
"If citizen do not do what the law says， they will be punished ."	B_S0
"Just like child education , parents punish their children when  they are climb the tree ."	I_S0
"It is true that children would behave ， but not for too long ,  and it also hurt the relationship between parents and children ."	I_S0
"Citizens will complain about the difficult and inconvenience of household waste collection ."	I_S0
"It is time-consuming to sort all garbage ."	I_S0
"Citizens may not want to do it ."	I_S0
"It may be as it was before the law was enacted ， if nobody inspections ."	E_S0
"However，making a recycling legal is not only way to solve this question ， it needs other thing to cooperate，such as  civil volunteer ."	S_M1
"They monitor the behavior of the community residents ."	B_S0
"The environmental awareness of the residents is also significant ."	I_S0

"Many big cities in the world have traffic problems but these problems may difference from each other."	S_M2
"For example, it is easy to go around my city from 10 am to 5 pm."	B_S0
"Because students go to school and workers go to work."	I_S0
"However, outside these hours, you have to take double time to get to your definitions."	I_S0
"In some other cities, traffic is busy at all times, and there is the continual noise of car horns and  this may le people go mad."	I_S0
"One of the best approaches governments can provide large sums of money to encourage the development of public transport."	I_S0
"Buses are good examples and they are cheap and reliable, people will willing to use them."	I_S0
"About another suggestion, I think the government can limit the using of private cars."	I_S0
"For example,in the weekdays only cars which last number is odd number can be driven."	I_S0
"Moreover,students can take school bus to school or ride their bycicle or on foot."	E_S0

"Some people may consider it is better for children to choose jobs that are similar to their parents' jobs than to choose jobs that are very different from their parents'."	E_I0
"However, I hold the oppose standpoint."	S_T1
"Because I have several reasons to hold back my opinion."	S_T0
"First, children will have more freedom."	S_M1
"If children select the job which is similar to their parents, most of their parents will involve much with their working."	B_S0
"For example, my mother was a teacher, and I chose to be a teacher."	I_S0
"One day, when I invited my students to come to my home, my mother was incited by my students' closer relationship to me."	I_S0
"She thought it meant that the students were not respecting me."	I_S0
"So my mother shocked to my students and taught them how to talk to thier teacher."	I_S0
"My students were so afraid that I felt they were not willing to have a close relationship with me."	I_S0
"However, I think it was a really normal thing."	I_S0
"So after that I talked to my students and communicates with my mother, it was so difficult and trivial !"	I_S0
"Since my mother was a strict teacher, so she did not want to be close with her students and wanted to remain authority."	I_S0
"So she would impose her teaching style to me, and even she did not want me to be friends with my students."	I_S0
"So I think if the children's jobs are different to their parents, their parents will not constrict their children's working stuff."	E_S0
"In addition, children can be more independent."	S_M1
"When I strated to become a teacher, I relied everything to my mother."	B_S0
"Like I cannot complete my students homework, so I will assist to my mother to finish."	I_S0
"If I have some strifes to other teacher, myt mother would help me to solve the problem."	I_S0
"Then I felt I cannot live without my mother."	I_S0
"Therefore, have a different job is really important."	E_S0

"Nowadays, some people propose that university should spend more money on classes and libraries."	B_T0
"However, someone believes that sports and social activities should obtain financial support as much as academic program."	I_T0
"In my opinion, I agree with the latter."	E_T0
"There is no doubt that in university, academic education is very crucial."	S_M0
"At the same time, a lot of student  regard university’s academic level as one of the most important factor , when they choose university."	B_S0
"Hence, improving the quality of university’s academic atmosphere can attract more students."	I_S0
"However, sports and social activities are also important for student and necessary for university to invest."	E_S0
"Firstly, sport is extremely beneficial for student’s health."	S_M0
"As we know, student, especially university student, have numerous assignment and pressure."	B_S0
"Therefore, student need to do exercise , which can make them more healthy , so  they can pay more attention to their studies."	I_S0
"In this case, there are more student are willing to enter into this university."	I_S0
"Hence, university should develop their sports program  that provide student with a good sport condition, which give  student chances to take exercise."	E_S0
"Secondly, social activities is  very helpful for student in the long run."	S_M0
"Although one’s academic level can heighten their competition, when they seek job in the future, social communicate  ability can help them become more successful."	B_S0
"Social activities allow student make more friend , which can improve their communicate ability ."	I_S0
"During these  time, it can strengthen their confidence."	I_S0
"All of these can promote students become  more successful."	I_S0
"In this case, if one university’s students are very successful, it will increase this university’s impact , which is advantageous for this college."	I_S0
"Thus, social activities is  significant for university, and college should expend as much as academic program on social activities."	E_S0

"University students have their rights to choose what they really want to do."	I_S0
"If they have to do something they are not intersted in, they would not be happy."	I_S0
"Although they are having history class, they may think of other things."	I_S0
"As a result, the history class is really useless and the students will complain a lot."	E_S0
"Secondly, these classes can waste a lot of time."	S_M1
"University students have a lot of things to do."	B_S0
"They should spend their time on things which can help them in the future."	I_S0
"However, history classes can't help the majority improve."	I_S0
"Instead, they will waste their time."	I_S0
"So why should students take these classes?"	I_S0
"They can spend their time on more important things and improve themselves."	E_S0
"The last but not the least, history classes are a burden for most students."	S_M1
"As the history classes are reallt boring for most students, they don't want pay much attention on it."	B_S0
"However, the teacher will give them a lot of tasks, such as writing thesis and reciting history."	I_S0
"It is a burden that students have to bear."	I_S0
"And the result won't be good."	I_S0
"For example, if students have to write a history thesis, they will look for the resources and copy."	I_S0
"They will have to write something to prevent the teacher find out that they are plagiarizing."	I_S0
"And the thesis won't be good."	E_S0
"In conclusion, I really disagree with all university students have to take history classes, for it is really useful and waste a lot of time."	B_C1

"The bar chart demonstrates the number of rentals and sales of film in varying formats(VHS,DVD and Blu-ray)per year in a shop over a nine year period from 2002 and 2011."	S_I0
"As the information shown in the chart demonstrates,most people preferred to rent movies at the beginning of the period."	S_M1
"The number of rentals was just over 180,000 in 2002, while the number of VHS and DVD sales were only 85,000 and 48,000."	B_S1
"After that, the number of rented films and VHS sales showed downward trends, falling dramatically to just below 60,000 in 2011 and 10,000 in 2005 respectively and it is noticeable that no one bought VHS after 2006."	E_S1
"On the other hand,there was a rise of DVD sales, peaking at 215,000 in 2007."	S_M1
"And then the figure experienced a gradual decline to nearly 180,000 in the final year."	B_S1
"Blue-ray, a new movie format, which appeared in 2007, gained in popularity rapidly from 2,000 sales in 2007 to 13,000 in 2011."	E_S1
"Overalls,it is clear that renting and buying DVDs were the two most popular ways to watch movies over the given period."	S_S2
 
"In the present world, public health are increasingly important to our society."	S_T1
"Some people hold the believe that the best method to improve pubilic health is to provide more exercise equipments."	B_S0
"Whereas some others think that other measures are more effective."	I_S0
"Our society is developing in high speed and most people are busy on working."	I_S0
"They have little time to do take exercise, and as we all know, doing sports plays an important role in health."	I_S0
"So increasing sports facilities is necessary."	I_S0
"More public facilities means that citizens need not go to gyms."	I_S0
"It is more convenient and can cut daily cost as well."	I_S0
"People may have more time to stay with families and they can even make more friends easily."	I_S0
"This method can really help residents imporve life qualities."	I_S0
"However, some people argue that there are some other measures which are more crucial should be taken."	I_S0
"Comparing to taking sports, unsafe living conditions will bring destruction to health such as pollution and unsafe food."	I_S0
"Water, air and food are basic elements for human's life."	I_S0
"There's no doubt that many countries are facing the threat of pollution."	I_S0
"It causes massive death every year over the world."	I_S0
"And we always can watched the news of unsafe food that are sold by irresponsible business."	I_S0
"So goverment should pay more attention to these issues and take some measure to avoid the aggravation of enviroment and nature such as establishing more stricked rules and laws to punish the orgnisations which destory natural resources or produce unqualified food."	I_S0
"In my view, adding sports facilities is a good way to improve public health."	I_S0
"But it's more important to take measures to avoid any actions that may damage public health."	E_S0
 
"Knowledge is power."	S_I0
"Freedom of expression and speech is a crucial part of most modern societies."	B_T1
"Within this culture, many people believe that by sharing information freely among all humanity, the future of the world is enhanced."	E_T1
"Although some reasons for sharing information freely include rapid development of science and benefit of humanity, I believe it should be solicited without pay."	S_T0
"Indeed, sensitive information that could penetrate state security, lead to public outcry, hand over technologies to terrorist groups and facilitates corporate monopoly in the trade sector deserves to be scrutinized making them accessible."	S_M0
"In this digital era, information spread like wildfire and for the sake of maintaining global peace, this translation is from laokaoya website, they should be delimited."	B_S1
"For instance, if the nuclear technology is shared with all nations for scientific study, the world will soon stand on the verge of obliteration, despite an inconceivable possibility this technology possesses to facilitate the citizens."	E_S1
"However, scientific research largely depends on available data and previous discoveries."	S_M0
"If valuable information and past findings are not shared openly to academics and researchers the global progress will standstill."	B_S1
"For instance, the internet is probably the most significant invention the modern world has produced and if this technology had not been shared by the US military, we would still be living in the pre-internet era."	E_S1
"Moreover, the curbed information has no value if they are not implemented in the real world and thus curbing them is like slaughtering the potential for progress."	S_M0
"World history suggests that human race has advanced due to the discoveries and inventions shared with the world as each finding went through profound modification and advancement."	S_S2
"In conclusion, i believe information should shared freely."	S_C2
 
"Memoir is a form of historical document that recall a time period and a person vividly."	B_I0

"Memoirs are still rather accurate as a reference."	S_T1
"Critics doubted the financial status of Chevalier while he was living in Switzerland, there were evidences that Chevalier frequntly borrowed large amount of money from a Swiss businessman."	S_M0
"However, what needs to be taken in account is that morgaging properties require time to be converted into cash, usually a few days, this means that it would be necessary for Chevalier to borrow some money while he awaits for cash."	B_S0
"Therefore, even if Chevalier was rich, it would still be understandable for him to borrow money."	I_S0
"The critic did not consider the time period  in which Chevalier lived in, and take in account essential background information, thus making the critic unreasonable and invalid."	E_S0
"Secondly, there were also questions on the accuracy of conversations between Chevalier and Voltaire recorded in the memoir."	S_M0
"Critics claimed that memoir cannot possible be reliable as it was written many years after when the conversation happened."	B_S0
"But there is now evidence that there were people witnessed Chevalier writing journals right after the conversation has taken place, and that he did frequently refer back to his diary when writing the memoir."	I_S0
"This means that those exchanges would be trustworthy as they were recorded shortly after, ink on paper cannot possibly go wrong."	I_S0
"While writing the memoir, Chevalier must have both used his memory as well as his journal, which will make the memoir accurate and not made up."	E_S0
"The escape from the Venetian prison was also challenged by critics; they claimed that such plot was only made up to entertain the readers."	S_M0
"I do agree with the literature element in the memoir, that linguistic devices and exaggeration are often used to attract the readers attention."	B_S0
"But I would say that storylines are often based on what has actually happened."	I_S0
"It is unlikely for a story to be made up entirly."	I_S0
"Plus there were also documentation from the Italian Government that the roof of the prison required repairing after Chevalier's escape."	I_S0
"This is a proof that he did escape through the ceiling indeed."	I_S0
"In addition, it was also unrealistic to bride the guards as the prison also kept many other wealthy people who failed to escape via bribery."	E_S0
"In conclusion, I would disagree wit"	S_S2
 
"Some parents always to provide some bonus to thier children when they get high grades in school."	B_I0
"That shows that the parents really concern their children's grade."	E_I0
"However, personally I don't think this a good way to encourage school-age children."	B_T0
"there should be more effiective and variable methods to tell children that they have a good job."	E_T0
"To begin with, offering their school-age children money could raise a awareness that money is closely related to the high grades due to their poor recognize ablility."	S_M0
"What's more,children could cheat in some exams so that they can some fancy toys."	B_S0
"That wrong realization of the relationship between money and study can push them go astray."	I_S0
"So parents possibly push their children to go astray in that way."	E_S0
"Secondly, children would think gain that money is so easy to get which makes them take it for granted."	S_M0
"They would not cherish the money which thier parents earn it so hard."	B_S0
"And when they have money suddenly, they maybe don't konw how to spare it."	I_S0
"Damaging to their health and grade can be down result in lacking of self-contrl."	I_S0
"They can buy too many video games or snack."	I_S0
"So it is hard to monitor them how to use that money."	E_S0
"Indeed a postive feedback to their high grades can motivate children to study harder."	S_M0
"But that will lead children pay their all attention to thier grade and overlook thh others."	B_S0
"Grade is only a small indicator to value the performance in school."	I_S0
"Parents can't show too much attention to that."	I_S0
"Learing how to communicate with people, how to make friends is also important for the school-age children."	I_S0
"There is other ways can encourage children to study harder such as take them to travle or just spent more time with their children."	E_S0
"From what has been discussed above, I can come to a conclusion that giving money to chilidren when they perform well in exam is not a approprated method because that will cause misunderstanding of the relationship between money and grade."	S_C2
 
"Thanks for the increansing of technology,many people are able to  travel to those places which are vary far from us."	S_T1
"For most normal people,it might be an attractive oppurtunity."	B_S0
"But for the whole environment,it can be a huge trouble."	I_S0
"The most negative effact of tourists' visit is the damage to the creatures in those places."	I_S0
"Animals and plants,and even creatures we can not see by our eyes,are more likely to live without human."	I_S0
"Professional scientists may not affact them because they know how to protect them,but normal tourists can not understand this."	I_S0
"Most of them only care about how to take a best photo for these beautiful creatures."	I_S0
"And they can break these wild lives' habit or even distroyed their habitat with out any attention."	I_S0
"Scientists' work can also be affected by tourists."	I_S0
"In those places whose climate is terrible,tourists will live with scientists unavoidably."	I_S0
"Then tourists' daily life can make scientists can not concentrate on their work."	I_S0
"And some of them may even manage to earn money from tourists rather than do their research better."	I_S0
"It can really cause chaos to science area."	I_S0
"The public have right to meet their curiousity, but it can not cost the environment."	I_S0

"Nowadays, more and more  people are leading a peaceful life."	B_I0
"In that case, we have ability to help other people in need."	E_I0
"Even thought this is true, I don’t think there are more people are willing to help the struggling stangers."	S_T0
"Here, I'll tell you the reason why I am disagreed."	S_T1
"First, most of us afraid of being cheated by the strangers."	S_M2
"The best example is the chearters in some railway station or subway station."	B_S0
"These strenger pretend to be very poor or in-need."	I_S0
"They tell people they are on the way home but lost their travel fees."	I_S0
"Thus the cheaters can get the sympathy from the warm-hearted people."	I_S0
"This is commen in most countries."	I_S0
"However, the method has been known to almost everybody."	I_S0
"So when one meet this situation, they will chose to ignore instead of helping."	E_S0
"On the other hand, people prefer to help the person who can reward them."	B_C0
"When one help othersthey may not get any reward."	I_C0
"After all, not all of us are generous."	I_C0
"Most of the time, we should pay for the help."	E_C0

"I think this is a good idea that some parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school."	B_I0
"Firstly,the power to study hard is very important to school-age children."	I_I0
"Parents made their children know that if they get high mark at school they can earn some money to buy something they want."	I_I0
"This is another way for school-age children to get pocket money."	I_I0
"Besides doing house work,study hard at school maybe relaxer for school-age children."	I_I0
"Children always want to compare with others that someone have a new video game or beautiful doll they don't have."	I_I0
"They usually ask their for help."	I_I0
"But if school-age children have more pocket money from the high grade they get in school,they can buy what they want for theirselves."	I_I0
"Competition between clothes or toys gradually transports into the competition for the marks they get in school."	E_I0
"This is a good strategy to increase children's desires to get good grades."	S_T1
"Secondly,offer school-age children money in this way can also tell them the difficulties to earn money."	S_M2
"Studying hard at school is not easier than doing a good job in a company."	B_S0
"During the time children to get high marks,they push themselves to study in a deep way."	I_S0
"They have no time to play computer games or be lazy for their school work."	I_S0
"They must spend more time on studies in ordre to get higher marks."	I_S0
"So they spend more time than others to get good results."	I_S0
"Parents can tell them only if you spend more effort than others in studies can you get higher marks ."	I_S0
"So does it during the work they have in the future."	E_S0
"Thirdly,offering children money for each high grade they get in school can help them establish their attitude toward studies and work."	B_C1

"Students who have the skill about Science and Technology can make people's life easier."	I_S0
"Scientific study helps the development of technology products which can liberty workers from laborious tasks or house wives from the tedious household duties."	I_S0
"Through that people have more spare time to do their interests instead of tedious works."	I_S0
"That the reason why it is significant for students to learn science course which shift people's life better."	I_S0
"By contrast, history teaches students to understand past events in order to avoid mistakes that we made before."	I_S0
"The claasical historical stories show a moral example to studets, which can educade students' behaviours."	I_S0
"After students know the uncomfortable results of nonstandard behaviours, they will not do blind imitation."	I_S0
"However, I believe that science and technology are more suitable for students now."	I_S0
"These subjects unlike history which often makes students sleepy by boring story-telling provid an opportunity enhance the creativity of students."	I_S0
"For example there are a lot of experiments which opean students' mind in science study."	I_S0
"In conclusion, although the history normalizes the behavious of students, I think science play a more important role in school studies."	E_S0
 
"This diagram illustrates the process of elelctricity production in a power station using waterpower."	S_I0
"The way of operation in the hydroelectic power station is different during the day and night."	S_M1
"In the first stage during daytime, the flowing of river is hindered by a dam, forming the high-level reservoir."	B_S0
"The intake is open for water to flow in the pipe in order to generate electric power later by the generator, which is operated by reversible turbines in the power station."	I_S0
"After that, water flow to the low-level reservoir while electricity is transmitted by power lines to the national grid, which is the final step."	E_S0
"By contrary, water moves in the opposite direction at night from the low-level reservoir, followed by being pumped by reversible turbines towards the high-level reservoir."	S_M1
"The intake is closed at night to prevent further movement of water from river."	S_S2
"In conclusion, the hydroelectric power station can be operated by two different ways in daytime an at night, producing electricty from water."	S_C2

"in the morden socility,wo can study knowledge in different methods."	I_S0
"there are more TV programs which can let us study social knowledges and some TV programs can let us release mental pressure."	I_S0
"in the past,student only can study knowledge in the school."	I_S0
"but in the present,wo can study more knowledge in different TV programs which can teach us some social skills."	I_S0
"and in the presnt,some workers have some mental pressures which will let them feel boring."	I_S0

"afterword they still can make living."	I_S0
"some people think some poor TV programs which will let them have poor quality of lift."	I_S0
"because some elder only like to see the country policy programs."	I_S0
"they do not like to see some programe of amusement."	I_S0

"For example,you can do anything."	B_S0
"self-employed is very freedom."	I_S0
"You will more and more hard work,because this is yourself company,you are a boss."	I_S0
"And you can promote your experience."	E_S0
"Work for a company or organisation is very stability."	S_M2
"And we haven't pressure less than self-employed."	B_S0
"We just do myself."	I_S0
"But self-employed have some disadvantages too."	I_S0
"For example,you should work anything or maybe you will lose some money."	I_S0
"Work for a company or organisation have some disavantage too."	I_S0
"Work for a company or organisation is very boring."	I_S0

"The media rarely disclose details of crimes to the public."	S_M0
"Afraid that people will learn the knowledge of crime, on the road to crime."	B_S1
"The media will also be restricted by the government and can only be selective."	E_S1
"However, I think the media should publicize the details of crimes to the public, because people can improve their own attempts and learn some knowledge out of life."	S_M0
"People can not only learn knowledge but also understand some relevant legal knowledge, which can make us better identify the crimes around us."	S_S2
"Now there are also some programs and animations about crime details on TV, such as "law in progress" and "conan", which can not only arouse people's interest in TV programs, but also help them learn more relevant knowledge."	S_M0
"However, when reporting the details of crimes, there should also be selective reporting, and some serious information endangering national security should not be reported, so as to reflect the preciseness of TV programs."	S_S2
"Overall,I think the media should report the details of the crime to the public."	S_C2
 
"In comtemporary life, the manners we work and handle different assignments varies a lot."	B_I0

"There are some people who are in favour of have a work task to accomplish only three days a week for long hours."	E_I0
"However, I would rather agree that it is better to work five days a week for shorter hours."	S_T1
"First, working five days a week wil produce more efficency for our assignment."	S_M1
"I can make sure that almost every person have ever suffered in a desperate time while trying your best handling a big difficult challenge."	B_S0
"Sometime your brain and nerve might not get used to be under so much pressure in a long and struggle time."	I_S0
"That's why everyone needs to have a rest after a forty five minutes lesson."	I_S0
"It is a great chance for you to take a break."	I_S0
"So is the work schedule."	I_S0
"If we keep on working in such a long time, our body cannot help sending us a disappointing signal to prevent us from staying in front of our paper work any more."	I_S0
"Thus, our work efficency decreased directly."	E_S0
"Moreover, working five days a week can help you get on a diet and have a more regular and healther life style."	S_M1
"Take my college experience as an example, sometimes we may have only 3 days in a week when it is plenty of  courses."	B_S0
"And some of our student might only be willing to take time to review lessons in that three days."	I_S0
"However, they might choose to escape from study and go outside to enjoy the playing period in the other five days."	I_S0
"And that would finally cause a negtive effect in not only their grades but also their life style, and that is really disapointed for them to master a long- term beneficial manners."	I_S0

"In nowadays,  Some people believe that unpaid community service should be a compulsory part of high school programmes, like working for a charity, improving the neighbourhood or teaching sports to younger children."	S_T1
"For me I disagree with the statement and I will use two reasons to support my idea."	S_T0
"To begin with, we should respect everyone's choice and disire in all kinds of reasons and cases, especially for working."	S_M1
"Someone would like to do the community service for free, someone does not, but this should be a personal choice which depends on people's willing, it should not be compulsory."	B_S1
"Those who think these jobs should be compulsory are dicrespectful for high school students, to do the services or not, it should be up to students' own choices."	E_S1
"Next, a compulsory stuff could caused reverse, let the students who would like to do the job feel hard."	S_M1
"All the unpaid job should based on people's own willing, compulsory will work on  the oppisive direction."	S_S2
"In conclusion, I highly disagree with the statement that unpaid community service should be a compulsory part of high school programmes, and support my idea."	S_C2

"From my personal perspective, this brand-new phenomenon should be embraced with more optimism."	E_T0
"There are some demerits about the inability to get rid of the media's control over people's minds."	S_M0
"First of all, some people think that their opinions and attitudes will not be controlled by the media."	B_S0
"Because they think they can judge."	I_S0
"A good case in point is that some people will talk about whether the government's decision is right when they watching the news."	I_S0
"In addition, people believe that the media cannot be controlled by a few people, so they choose to participate in the media."	I_S0

"However, there are also some merits that cannot be ignored."	S_M0
"For one thing, People can't get rid of the influence of the media."	B_S0
"Therefore, people can't live without the media."	I_S0
"A good case in point is that, children watch TV from an early age."	I_S0
"Adults use cell phones every day."	I_S0
"So, people's lives will always be influenced by the media."	I_S0
"For another, people who control the media have strong professional skills."	I_S0
"So they can ensure the quality of media content."	I_S0

"It is possible that genetics as nature and environment as nurture are not mutually exclusive."	S_I0
"This assumption may explain in part the different levels of personal ability in music, art, sport and so on."	S_T0
"In other words, good training is as important as natural talents."	S_T1
"From one point of view, being born with special gifts is certainly an advantage."	S_M1
"What tells a difference is the innate talent which may be something that cannot be taught, and something money cannot buy."	B_S0
"That is to say, without such born talent, no matter how good the teacher is or how frequently a person practices, there is little hope for him or her to become an excellent musician, artist, or sports player."	I_S0
"Underlying this view is the fact that there is more to a natural skill than a learned technique."	I_S0
"Indeed, some people do have talents that are probably inherited via their genes, allowing them to excel in specific fields."	I_S0

"Hard work could make a difference in children who are motivated to be aiming high in whatever discipline, including music, art or sport."	B_S0
"At school, plenty of exceptional examples are found as evidence to support the claim that a child can acquire specific skills through continuous training under appropriate guidance."	I_S0

"Actually, the current education systems are based on the belief that all children can be taught to learn different skills, however demanding."	E_S0
"As a conclusion, any child can be trained to different degrees to become professionals, but to be really good in such areas as music, art and sport, then probably certain talents are required."	B_C0

"So,in my opion, learing a froeign language at primary school is better."	E_I0
"First of all, primary school studente are do well in mermoriaing knowledge expeically wrods and grammar."	S_T1
"When children go to primary school, their curiosity is generally high and they like new knowledge, so it is easier to understand words."	S_T0

"It is true that nowadays a large number of museums are collecting the tickets for gate revenues, at the same time, others keep free entry."	S_I0
"I strongly believe that, overall, the benefit of asking for entrance fees prevail over its drawbacks."	S_T1
"Certainly, that kind of museums whose gete fees are necessary can benefit from their gate receipts."	S_M1
"First of all, a large proportion of the money can be used to redecorate the museum to an ornater one than before, through which can the museum attract a increasing number of people who appreciate it."	B_S0
"The second, those people who are more likely to be idlers and come in the museum only aim at using the free Wi-Fi and enjoying the air conditioner that not charged can be decreased."	I_S0
"To a large extent, that kind of individuals only disturb others with noise and take up public rest space."	I_S0
"What is more, there are some persons believe that if a museum is charging for expense, there must be something rare and precious in it."	I_S0
"As a result, they will buy the entrance ticket to satisfy their curiosity."	E_S0
"On the other hand, the impact of collecting gete tickets is not always so positive."	S_M1
"The reason is that the group of individuals who are concern about saving money are not likely to be willing to spend money on the entrance fees."	B_S1
"Therefore, the market of that kind of museums charging for admission will be limited."	E_S1
"Overall, I propose that the trend of collecting entrance tickets is largely beneficial to museums."	B_C0
"Though the museums will suffer a lost of part of the market, they are able to win the hearts of another group of people who believe that the museums that charging will be more fascinating."	I_C0
"So, I agree with museums to charge for gate tickets."	E_C0
 
"Many young students are leaving schools with negative thoughts on studying, and I believe that this is not a good thing to be done if most of the students have the thoughts like this."	S_T1
"However we have to look throughly about this phenomenon, as if it is the reflection of the education area."	B_S0
"There could be many reasons to cause the student's leaving."	I_S0
"For example, they could be really mad at the teachers, as they are not listening to their ideas; also, it could be the parents, who put too much pressure on them, and therefore they feel stressed and produce the hatred of studying; finally, phenomenons like this happens might because the students have listened to something that make their view very twisted and find everything unhelpful."	I_S0
"Firstly, the cause of the teachers."	I_S0
"Teachers, are the holiest job in my opinion, as they have the responsibility to look after the students and make them the reliable generation who can contribute to many stunning achievments."	I_S0
"They are also the one who could make the students think that study is useful and they would like to learn more."	I_S0
"Isn't that just the gloriest thing to do for a teacher?"	I_S0
"But, on the other hand, they could also be the one who lead the student start hating studying."	I_S0
"Even a tiny bit of offense, could been misunderstood by the teenagers."	I_S0
"In my primary school, some teachers only like some particular students and just ignore the others; they did not provide any help to them and even put rude words on them to embarrase them in front of all of the class."	I_S0
"If this kind of thing happens on a daily bases, there are always someone who couldn't bear it anymore, they then start losing confidence and trust in studying and school, then they will leave the school as they think there's not point of trying hard, as the teacher will mever like them."	I_S0
"However, I believe that everything can be solved if we really try."	I_S0
"I think that if the teacher can make themselves respect every students in the class, the number of students who has negative views on studying would reduce; or, if the teacher cannot do it, build a complain box in the school, which students can put all the complains about anything in school."	I_S0
"If somebody sees it and stand out for it, everything will be fine."	I_S0
"Also, the parents are an effective character on their children, as they planned everything for them."	I_S0
"Some of the parents, as I know, just plan everything without asking the student's opinion, they believe that everything they do is good for them, but is it really?"	I_S0
"Do they truely know what the student is tinking and do they really like it or not?"	I_S0
"Furthermore, some bossy parents ignore every complain the student has made and respond to all of them with 'it's good for you'."	I_S0
"I find that very unacceptable as the student should have the power and responsibility to make decisions for themselves and try to deal with any negative consequences."	I_S0
"Over a long period of time, if the student has nowhere to talk their heart out or to communicate with the parents, they would become very aggressive and rude."	I_S0
"They could also make friends with some random people on the street who continously make them hate school and parents (which link to my third point)."	I_S0
"I think, if the parents can become a little bit more respectful towards the children, and listen to their thoughts and opinion, then make a decision that everyone agrees with."	I_S0
"Then, nobody would be unhappy about the decidion."	I_S0
"Or, if they find the thoughts mde by the student ridiculous, talk to them, know why they think like this, and try to solve it peacfully without any forces of threatens."	I_S0
"This could also avoid making any unhelpful 'friends' of the student."	I_S0
"Finally, I want to say that do not give up trying on anything."	I_S0
"Even though you can't see the hope, still try, you might find something eventurally."	I_S0
"Always try to think positively about something and just try to talk and communicate with the people with different views."	I_S0
"This would make everyone more positive."	E_S0
 
"Nowdays some parents believe that they should give their school-age children money for high grade ,others do not think so."	B_T0
"However ,in my opinion,I aggre with the parents who give their children money when they get in school."	E_T0
"In modren society ,people have more and more pressure ,specially high students ,to illustrate ,they should do lots of homework in order to meet their teachers demands ."	S_M2
"What is more ,high school students spend all time in school so that they have no time to look for part-time job to earn money by themselves ."	B_S0
"In addition,giving their money for each high grade is able to encouage them to studay better,maybe it can avoide them getting in trouble because they lack of money ."	I_S0
"Last but not least ,I think school-age children are too young to make monry independence."	E_S0
"To sum up ,I am conform that parents could give their children money during they get in shcool."	S_S2
 
"Nowadays, eith the development of the society, people's lives have been improved a lot."	B_I0
"And parents thesdays have been more and more concerned about children's education."	E_I0
"As a result, whether parents should let their children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes."	S_T1
"From my perspective, this opinion is reasonable."	S_T0
"First of all, Let children to make mistakes and learn from them can help them to have a better future when they grow up."	S_M1
"Children who do things by themselves and make mistakes can help them to gain a lot of experience and improve themselves."	B_S0
"Then they would be aware of the mistakes they made and have stronger impression."	I_S0
"So next time they won't make the same mistakes."	I_S0
"For example, students who study alone and make mistakes would heip them to learn quickly since the mistakes are made by themselves rather then being influenced by their parents."	I_S0
"After several time of making mistakes and learn from them, they could hardly forget what they learned so that they could get a better grades without others help."	E_S0
"Secondly, it can cultivate them not to be afraid of hardness."	S_M1
"When children first make a mistake, they may be afraid of making mistakes again if parents sto them immediately,  however if not they"	O
 
"The reading passage is talking that there are three points that can prove Robert reached the North Pole, and the listening, considering the fact that the three reasons from reading are not enough to prove this travel, does not agree with the reading."	B_T1
"Thus, the views of the two are divergent."	E_T1
"First of all, the author advocates that the committee invested the records and equipment from Robert's and made sure he achieves the North Pole."	S_M0
"However, the listening, disagree with the author, demonstrates that the committee was unbelievable because many members in it were the friends of Robert and may help him hide the truth."	S_S2
"Moreover, the author raises the issue that a British explorer named Tom used same kind of dogsled and numbers of dogs such as Robert and use less than 37 days archived the North Pole to verify Robert could reach the North Pole in 37 days."	S_M0
"On the contrary, the speaker holds a different point that Tom still used the airplane to transport resources for him and the weather was better than the condition that Robert met."	S_S2
"Finally, the reading part states that the shadows in the photos that were taken by Peary can prove that."	S_M0
"In this regard, the listening passage challenges the author with the fact that these photos are very old, faint, and unfocusing, thus it is difficult to identify the shadows and get the clues from them."	S_S2
 
"Nowdays, many shudents are leaving schools with negative thoughts on studying."	S_T0
"I think this is a very serious problem."	S_T1
"Students no mind in studying,they always think when they can play computer games and play basketball,which make them dislike studying."	B_S0
"So that they leave schools with negative thoughts on studying."	I_S0
"With the social development rapidly,more and more students crazy in playing computer games."	I_S0
"They always go home and then bigin playing computer."	I_S0
"Students are addicted to playing computer games easily."	I_S0
"This makes students no minds in studying."	I_S0
"And they 
  Mobile phone also make a large difference in students."	I_S0
"Students chat with other friends by QQ."	I_S0
"And they play some mobile game."	I_S0
"These waste much students studying time."	I_S0
"In my opinion,as a student,we should play less computer game and mobile phone."	I_S0
"We should take more time in studying,which make us more experienced."	I_S0
"We will keep in a good cindition in our school studying."	I_S0
"We should be leaving school with positive thoughts on studying."	E_S0
 
"Some of the governments think that the most important goal of the country is the economic progress,however, many people have an opinion that other types of progress are equally important for a country."	B_T0
"I insist that the economic progress is their most important goal."	E_T0
"the reason why I think the economic progress is important is that the prosperity of economic can bring benefits and convenience to the other fields of progress,such as transportation and education."	S_M1
"Specifically,if the goverment has a great development of the economy, the government will increase their budgets on the education and infrastructure,once the infrastructure has been built , it is very convenient for urban residents to take a public transportation,such as subway ,or buses."	B_S0
"In the same way."	I_S0
"if the governments make investments in education , it means that the majority of people can receive the compulsory education and even be able to enjoy the higher education and then the other kinds of progress are made."	E_S0
"However , it doesn't mean that other types of progress is not significant in a country."	S_M1
"Like culture industry, can bring the happiness to the people, for example, going to the movies can bring happiness to the audience."	B_S0
"Moreover, during the process of the watching the movies,you might have the same feeling as the characters of the movie."	I_S0
"gradully, you will be touched by this movies,that inspire the meaning in your life,  
how to keep relationship with your friends, and how to communicate with your family members."	E_S0
"In summary, although the other types of progress are  also important for a country, the prosperity of economy is the most important goal, because if economy is sluggish, it is very diffcult for a country to make other types of progress."	S_C2
 
"In this fast developing society, people usually won't pay much attention to what happened in the past."	S_I0
"And when asked about the attitude towards whether all the students in the university should be asked to take history classes without concerning what their field of study is, people always exist an air of uncertainty."	B_T0
"However, when the question comes to me, I wholeheartedly agree that all university students should take history classes."	E_T0
"First, taking history courses can give chances to university students to gain more friends."	S_M0
"Since university students may have a lot of pressure, they would like to have friends with who are interesting while they are also helpful."	B_S0
"And people who know a lot about history may be more interesting to communicate with."	I_S0
"Moreover, people who take history courses will know many history events, so when their friends have some trouble, they can give their friends many constructive suggestions."	I_S0
"In this way, students who take history classes can be helpful and interesting."	I_S0
"So they will have more opportunities to make friends."	E_S0
"Then, many history events and historical heros should be remembered."	S_M0
"People today have happy lives because of their ancestors who devoted themselves to their countries."	B_S0
"Their ancestors did a lot and even sacrificed themselves to gain happiness for their offsprings."	I_S0
"How can people forget about them and forget how they fight to defend their countries with gratefulness?"	I_S0
"So, no matter what field the university students study in, they are always a member of the country."	I_S0
"In this way, they have the responsibilities to remember their ancestors and pass on the events that their ancestors went through to the next generation."	E_S0
"Last but not the least, taking history classes can make people love their country more."	S_M0
"In the history classes, people will get to know what was their origin, how they developed, and what their ancestors went through."	B_S0
"Take my own experience as an example."	I_S0
"When I was in junior high shool, I took a history class."	I_S0
"And during the class I got to know a lot of tragic events that happened in the past right on the earth where we are now."	I_S0
"And I know that our nation paid a lot to win the battle."	I_S0
"Although it was tragic, we have a happy life now."	I_S0
"So I thought that I should love my country just like my ancestors did, and devote myself to the country in order to make it better."	E_S0
"To conclude, I personally think that it is necessay for all the university students to take history courses no matter what field they are study in now."	S_C2
 
"Some negative towards life, like impatience, have impact our daily life, expecially do harm to those students in college, which lives in an enviornment between campus and society."	S_T1
"The reason why most of these learners hold negative attitude towards study is that they still do not have enough power to get themselves self-controlled, in the meantime, the addition comes from the world out of school often makes them insane."	B_S0
"In case of that, the youngers can not concentrate on studying."	I_S0
"Besides of the reason given above, the stress of living should  also counted."	I_S0
"It is not difficult to understand the behavior that some students stop studying to working while their familly can not afford the higher expenses in the higher levels of education, and in case of that, they may think nothing of study, but make money."	I_S0
"As far as i can see, the government should make some efforts to cheer the students up, such as make more scholarship to inspire the passion of them for study,or because"	E_S0
 
"In this modern world, everybody would like more money."	B_I0
"But is there a connection between the quality of education to salaries of university professors?"	E_I0
"I strongly believe that there is a connection between the salaries of professors and the teaching level, giving the university professors more salaries means giving them more opportunity and better teaching environment, and therefore will give students a better education."	S_T0
"What if the salaries for university professors increase?"	S_M0
"One result is that more highly - educated people will be willing to become professors."	B_S0
"It is a fact that graduated students compare the salaries of jobs to choose what they want to become, some students will not consider being a professor because the salary is too low comparing to other jobs."	I_S0
"For universities, raising the average salary means more people will be willing to become a professor, and with more people there will be more choices and the universities can find better and more suitable professors."	E_S0
"Nowadays, some professors go out to find other work in order to get more money for their family."	S_M0
"Imagine a professor only teaching, and another professot made his or her schedual full by not only teaching, but also writing books to sell, charging students for tutor and doing projects to get money."	B_S1
"They will not have that much energy to teach, even if they are good teachers."	E_S1
"Moreover, it is well known that money is a powerful way to drive people to work harder."	S_M0
"When I was small I hated playing the piano, my mom used to give me pocket money after piano lessons, so I got really excited whenever there's a piano lesson."	B_S0
"This also applies on adults, and the salaries can be given in other ways, such as giving money to whichever teacher the student like best, or the teacher with the best class average score."	I_S0
"Psychologists proved that this workes, and therefore I support the idea of giving money to those who work harder, to give those who didn't get the prize to do better."	E_S0
"All in all, spending more money on salaries for university professors is helpful to improve the quality of education."	B_C0
"This is primarily because nowadays people want more money, and more money can get better things in return."	I_C0
"Giving more salaries to professors will encourage people to become professors, reducing part - time jobs that takes energy, and drives professors to work harder."	I_C0
"For these reasons, I believe that for the sake of education of future leaders and future elits in every field, it is"	E_C0
 
"The graph illustrates how the three main exports of Southland changed in 2000 and 2020, and make a projection for 2025."	S_I0
"We can see that more and more people in Southland choose to travel to other countries from 2000 to 2025 while the amount of meat products export decreased from 6 millions to 5 millions gradually."	B_T1
"As to the dairy products, it made 7 billions export and reached at the peak(10 billions) in the early 21 centery."	I_T1
"However it is predicted that drop to about 9.5 billions in 2025."	E_T1
"Overall, the international tourism is the biggest production of all exports  expect in 2020."	S_M2
"And the meat products take up the smallest propotion of all exports through all periods."	B_S1
"Besides that, dairy products is the most prosperous export industry in 2020."	E_S1
 
"Integrated Writing The passage concentrates on forest protection and lists three means that he thinks practical."	S_T1
"However, the speaker retorts all the three ideas one by one."	B_S0
"First, the writer reckons that international fund can be raised to protect mere agricultural use of the forest."	I_S0
"But the lecturer points out that agricultural damage is a strong destructive force."	I_S0
"In order to get harvest, farmers will use pesticide and fertile to help crops grow better."	I_S0
"This will produce run-off waste and water pollution which was detrimental to forest condition."	I_S0
"Therefore, the first approach of the passage is proved unconvincing."	I_S0
"Second, the passage says government should help to develop the economics of nearby villages and tribal communities so they will not make money through damaging the forest."	I_S0
"Nevertheless, the speaker regards this as an inadequate solution."	I_S0
"He emphasizes that money given to landowners – the government will not be used for forest developers."	I_S0
"It will not be properly used so the writer’s second idea is rebutted."	I_S0
"Third, the author indicates that we should be cautious about the loss of biodiversity caused by forest destruction."	I_S0
"Therefore, he argues that new trees should be planted to maintain biodiversity."	I_S0
"But the speaker says that if people are encouraged to plant new trees, they will first choose certain kinds of trees which can bring them commercial benefits."	I_S0
"Recovering forest biodiversity needs various kinds of trees."	I_S0
"So merely planting money-making trees in fact will harm biodiversity."	I_S0
"Thus reliably retorted the last argument in the essay"	E_S0
 
"Globalization has narrowed the distance of different countries and worlwide people can get the same goods."	B_T1
"This trend has two-side effects."	E_T1
"Mass producing makes productions cheaper, so customers can buy them in a low price."	S_M1
"For people in developing countries, they have no chance to use smart phone and other high-technic items before, but now they can easily find a affordable telephone."	B_S0
"What's more, globalization makes food imputs and outputs possible, which means America's low-price rice and corns can be transported to those countries without ability of feeding their people."	I_S0
"In this stage, this trend is positive."	E_S0
"On the other hand,  it also has side effects on local makets."	S_M1
"As those international goods are cheaper and they may even have a better quality, no one prefer to buy domestic goods."	B_S0
"In this case, numerous local companies will face the crisis of break-out, which means their employees are in danger of being fired."	I_S0
"Imputting food also has a hidden negative effect, too."	I_S0
"If a country's food security relies on another country, it will lose the right in association, and its national security will be threatened as well."	E_S0
"In my opinion, globalization is unable to stop, but it is neccessary to act to ensure the local coutries safety."	B_C0
"Tax is a effective tool to protect domestic market."	I_C0
"At the same time, we need more cooperation among different countries in the future."	I_C0
"As globalization makes us closer, we have a much bigger market and a much serious crisis."	I_C0

"We should face this development's influences, and try to make it in a right trail."	E_C0
 
"There is a heated discussion on whether our natural characteristics have much more influence on our personality and development and a research suggests the answer is yes."	S_I0
"But from my perspective, the experiences we may have in our life are the main factors that build our personality and values."	S_T0
"Our natural characteristics are decided by our genes, which means it cannot be modified by anything."	S_M1
"If we admit that our lives are controlled by the characteristics we are born with, that is to say everyone's destiny was certain at the moment they were born, which is obviously ridiculous."	B_S0
"Our natural characteristics do have some influence on our lives, especially in our early years, but there are very limited effects they can cause to the majority of our lives."	I_S0
"Instead of saying that our characteristics are the major influence, it is better to regard it as the foundation of our personality."	I_S0
"If everyone is a picture, your natural characteristic determine whether you are an oil painting or a pencil sketch, but your life experience determines the content of the painting."	E_S0

"The maps give us information about City Hospital in 2007 and 2010."	B_I0
"In 2007, City Hospital was rounded by Ring Road, and on the south of the road, there was a north-south road called Hospital Road with 6 bus stops  on its both sides and a car park for staff and pubilc on the east."	I_I0
"City Road crossed by Hospital Road on its south."	E_I0
"In 2010, the car park has remained only for staff and there has been established a another public car park on the east of the City Hospital connecting to Ring Road."	S_M1
"The conjunctions between Ring Road and City road have turn to be roundabouts, while the bus stops have change into a bus station on the west side on the Hospital Road connecting with two roundabouts."	S_S2
"Overall, comparing the two maps, we can discover significant changes after this development."	S_M1
"Only the locate of City Hospital has remained unchanged."	S_S2
 
"It is debated that althought the number of TV channels is increasing right now,the quality of the programs are getting worse，with no doubt，should be consider。"	O
"On the one hand，when the  TV channels become widder,it means that there are more varieties,for example,the old，youngsters,adult and children can choose a great deal of types，such as soap opera，sports，cartoon and even ghost film 。besides ，for all of the TV channel,program producers can focus on the particular field rather than cover all of them,therefore,there will be romance,detective films in one channel throughout the day rather than one column of film
  On the other hand,more channels may be trigger problems ."	S_M2
"one of the defect is that if a corporation is in charge of just one channel, the company could invest all ther money of programs,if the limited budget is distributed to several channels,there are several programs ,then the quality must be influenced negetively,more channels might cause conflicts between families when to stay,if family members watch the channel they liked for themselves ,it will be a large trouble
  In conclusion ,more options of channels can both be a great thing,thanks to program diversification be a finance and"	O
 
"One important stage in a child's growth is certainly the development of a conscience,whichis linked to the ability to tell right from wrong."	S_T1
"To begin,the behavior education for children is especially essential."	B_S0
"Parents and teachers would take some punishment since children are hard to identify the difference between right and wrong at a very young age."	I_S0
"I agree with the idea that proper punishment is necessary to help them learn this distinction."	I_S0
"Adults educate children with proper punishment which can make children keep this ecperience in their mind,it might be an effective way to avoid them make the same mistake again."	I_S0
"For example,my nephew is a ten year,sometimes he even escaped from school and went to play games in the Internet bar."	I_S0
"His parents tried to stop him many times by persuading him,but it doesn't work ."	I_S0
"Finally,his parents made a decision with him together,they will not give him any pocket money,but they will buy a behavior at school for a consevutive month."	I_S0
"Through this kind of punishment,my nephew realized how to balance play and study."	I_S0
"He got the computer and he also formed a good study habit finally."	I_S0
"As I mentioned above,I agree to take proper punishment to teach children."	I_S0
"In my opinion the proper punishment should be accepted both parents and children."	I_S0
"It is more like a negotiation."	I_S0
"For instance,if my nephew's parents forbid him to play games simply by not giving him any pocket money."	I_S0
"Eventually,he will find an improper way to figure out this problem,which might push him go to  another extreme."	I_S0
"I think it is necessary for the parents and teachers to find a proper punishment to education children, this punishment could be a real punishment,a reward of a punishment with a reward,it depends on if it works."	E_S0
 
"In comtemporary world,there are a growing number of approaches to relax yourself after a busy and exhausting day."	S_I0
"These mathods can be generalized into two categories,mentally and physically."	B_T0
"As for me,
I contend that relax by doing physical exercise is a better way."	E_T0
"The followings are statements of my point."	S_T1
"Firstly,the more we exercise,the more we sweat."	S_M1
"When sweats coming out from our bodies,we may all undergo a process that our sense of stress is going away."	B_S0
"Exercising physically can have us temporarily forget those unpleasent things and drive away our negative additude with sweats."	I_S0
"Take professional athletes for instance,most of them have a more energetic look than those politicians on TV."	I_S0
"Apart from releasing our pressure,doing physical exercise can also build up our own bodies,both beneficial to body and ment health."	E_S0
"Secondly,although reading books or watching a film may broaden our horizens and seem to be easy while doing these,they don't really give us a energetic feeling."	S_M1
"Don't you feel much more tired after reading or watching videos?"	B_S1
"That's because these activities still consume your energy of brains,you need brain to analyse messages,you need brain to memorize these automatically, which make you feel more sleepy rather  than restore your emphasis of doing things."	E_S1
"Apart from the comparasion with mental exercise and the strengths of physical exercise,the advantage that physical exercise can form a more outgoing character for a person can also contribute to supporting my idea."	S_C2

"Recently, a controversial topic has roused a heated debate: whether young people today are more likely to invest their time and efforts in improving the world than young people in the past?"	S_I0
"As far as I am concerned, young people today are more willing to try their best to improve the world."	S_T0
"To begin with, young people today have the demand to improve the world."	S_M2
"To be more specific, getting attention from world is a great satisfication for young people today since they are watching the world all the time through internet."	B_S0
"What's more, young people today can use internet to find the information they need and know which can help them improve the world."	I_S0
"In this case, young people tend to participate in things that change world in order to get more attention."	I_S0
"On the contrary, in the past, young people cannot know what is happening in the world and they did not know how to change the world."	I_S0
"So they were not aware of that they can improve the world."	I_S0
"Consequently, they were more likely to invest their time on their daily life."	I_S0
"For example, most of the young people nowadys have did some volunteer which also improve the society in some ways."	I_S0
"However, in the past, less people did volunteer."	E_S0
"To be followed, young people have time to improve the world."	S_C2
"To illustrate, young people today do not need to worry about how to make living since the society progress."	B_S0
"They can find a job to make living easily and then they have more free tiem than before."	I_S0
"In order to make a good use of this time, they are more willing to invest it to improve the world."	I_S0
"However, in the past, people always need to consider how to earn more monery to support their family."	I_S0
"They often need to work all days and did not have any time to invest."	E_S0
 
"Nowadays, due to the rapid development of society, the issue of whether people should follow the rules that societies today hope the young to follow has become an increasingly controvecial topic."	S_T0
"Some believe the rules are too strict to follow, while others believe they should follow."	S_T1
"Although I have some doubt, I tend to agree with the latter, and I will articulate my view below."	S_T0
"Firstly, the strict rules can help humans to tell right and wrong."	S_M0
"The reason why people should follow the rules is that the contends in the rule are those individuals consider as something awful, so they put them into the rules."	B_S0
"If persons follow the rules and don't break it, they will be the person who develop roundly."	I_S0
"To illustrate, reacently a sociologist did a rearch"	E_S0
"Besides, it is the freedom that the rules can bring to individuals."	B_M0
"Finally, although the it is uncomfotable for peole to follow the rules, the rules can protect them."	E_M0
"In fact, all of rules are built up to preserve the profit of most of people."	B_S0
"And if someone break the rules, they will do something harmful to the profit."	I_S0
"For example, all of people should follow the law of their country."	I_S0
"And the law is to protect citizens."	E_S0
"However, if someone want to get more profit which will be harmful in others' profit, they will be punished"	O
 
"The bar chart illustrates the annual number of rentals, VHS sales, DVD sales and Blu-ray sales of films from a certain store between 2002 and 2011."	S_I0
"In general, there was a decreasing trend of the number of  VHS sales between 2002 and 2005."	S_M1
"By contrast, the number of Blu-ray sales increased from 2007 to 2001."	B_S0
"Besides, the number of rentals kept decreasing from 2002 to 2001."	I_S0
"In addition, the number of DVD sales increased first and then decreased since 2008."	E_S0
"Starting with 185,000 in 2002, the number of rentals decreased to 55,000 in 2011."	S_M1
"The same trend can be seen on VHS sales."	B_S1
"The number of VHS sales decreased from 85,000 to 0 during the period from 2002 to 2006 and keep zero in the followed five years."	E_S1
"Starting with 45,000 in 2002, the number of DVD sales leap to 205,000 in 2007."	S_C2

"In the given news,we konw that there are many students who leave their schoool because of the negative thoughts in their minds,but the causes some people can not find out  very clearly."	S_T1
"While,we have to admit we may happen to have this thought sometimes in our school time,so we can try to understand this phenomenon."	B_S0
"The main reason I think is that we don't have enough confidence in our study,maybe we have a bad mood,a terrible test fault or the difficulties to solve our problems,they all influence our coinfidence step by step,the negative thoughts come into being."	I_S0
"If the students are in this situaton,don't worry,just find onething you are intrested in study,then extend your strengh and keep away your weakness."	I_S0
"Meanwhile,the encouragements coming from your teachers and parents are also improtent."	I_S0
"Another reason I think is that the students don't own a claer thought in why they should study,so they are in a completely mass, less compare now,then less harvest in future."	I_S0
"So they really should make a plan in why they should study."	I_S0
"In a word,konwleage is the only way to success."	I_S0
"Good luck."	E_S0
 
"Nowadays, many works explain their feeling about their salaries, and many employee thinks if they can not get satisfying salaries their work efficiency will become lower."	B_T1
"I think teacher is also like this situation, more salaries can trend them glad to work."	E_T1
"I think is universities spend more noney on salaries for professors, the quality if education will improved."	S_T0
"First, if uniiveristies give more salaries to teachers they will more glad to teach students."	S_M0
"LIke if the professor does not get enough salaries they would think why  I work so hard, it does not worth me to treat this very significance."	B_S0
"But, if the professor gets more salaries, he or she will think I need to work harder, and show the boss, I am a valuable person."	I_S0
"so, if the salaries of theachers higher, the quality of education will becomes higher."	E_S0
"Socend, more salaries can  help teachers to solve many economic problems, and they will more concentrate on their own work."	S_M0
"For instance, there was teacher in china, his wife got illness, but the medical payments were extramely expensive, he had no ablity to payit."	B_S0
"He bigan to worry about this incident, he did concentrate on the class, the quality of eduaction became terrible."	I_S0
"All the studens' grades lower than before."	I_S0
"Therefore, if salaries of this teacher was higher, the quality of education would not be affected so much."	E_S0
"Fianlly, if universitied spend more moeny on professors' salaries."	S_M0
"There will be more people glad to take part in this school, and unversites can gets more smart teachers."	B_S0
"For instacne, if school would like to spend more money, people will glad to go which place can give them best and highest benifits."	I_S0
"So,only school pay enough money, more talented people will come to school."	I_S0
"Then, high education backgroud teacher can teach more talend students."	E_S0
"In conclude,if unversities glad to spend more money on professors' salaries, the quality od education will improve more."	B_C0
"High salaries can let teacher glad to teach."	I_C0
"It can help teacher solves some problems."	I_C0
"And it also can get more high background teachers."	E_C0
 
"When we talk about the parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade, some people hold same positin as the statement that they think it is a good way for students to keep up and learn harder."	B_T1
"However, I partially agree with thier view points."	I_T1
"From my perspective, parents offer their children money for each high grade is bad, becuase children may doing somthing to get money, such as cheating, find answers on the internet."	E_T1
"At the beggining, offering money for children with high grade accounts for worse encouragement to children."	S_M0
"Actually."	B_S0
"some students prefer the money, but they cannot get the high score they would trying to cheat when they have a test instead learn something by themselves."	I_S0
"while some students they can get high score, but they still want the money, so they lean harder but they have less physical excises, so their body become worse at last they even can't to go to the school, and parents spend much more money than it should be."	E_S0
"Secondly, from  students aspect, they need to work harder than before, maybe they can get the money becuase of their high grade but they can't have fun or even relax themselves like before; From parents aspect, children may become greedy when they get the money from the first time, they would have more appetite to ask for more money, but in some poor family they can't afford it, if they don't give the money to children and their children would not trust their parents anymore or even don't want to study; From teacher's aspect, study meant to let students become knowledgable instead of money, for them giving the money to children is not the best idea."	B_M0
"In admitteddly, there are some people hold opposing view points that if parents don't offer their children with money is bad, children maybe would not have power to study."	E_M0
"Although i partcially agree with this statement, but i think parents could take them out, like to go to the museum or the park as the reward instead  of the money."	B_S1
"so this so called problem is not a problem."	E_S1
"In conclusion, I particially agree with the statement, but I also think parents give the money to the children who get good grade is bad with two reasons this is cannot essentially encourage students to get higher score, and for different people they have different reason for it."	S_C2
 
"Honestly, I do not agree this opinion at all."	S_T0
"I will present my thinking through 3 steps: growing traffic problem, pollution problem and measures might be more appropriate to solve these problems."	S_T1
"1)"	O
"Growing traffic
We all know that the traffic jam is cause by more and more vehicles nowadays."	B_S0
"Increasing the price the petrol will definately decrease the number of vehicles, but the cost of it is many people cannot get to their workplace conveniently."	I_S0
"Besides, for those who are capable to afford their own cars, the petrol fee may not influence their consuming behaviour as it is rather a negligible part for them."	I_S0
"So obviously, it is not a proper solution."	E_S0
"2)"	O
"Pollution problem
From a research held by Beijing government a few years ago, only around 4% of the pollution was caused by vehicles."	B_S0
"That is because the pollution is not only caused by traffic, which will only lead to air pollution, more pollution are released by factories when they produce their products: maybe some solid pollution, liquid pollution, etc."	I_S0
"Even we only calculate the air pollution, petrol is not the main reason for the air pollution since today's petrol is much cleaner than before."	E_S0
"3)"	O
"The better way to solve both problems
In my opinion, the best way to solve both traffic jam and more pollution are encouraging public traffic and searching for cleaner resources so far."	S_C2
"Like Hong Kong, though many people can afford cars and petrol, but their government send many subsidies to citiznes who choose to take public transportations, and in many countries and regions including Hong Kong, they provide a cleaner petrol for custome"	O
 
"We have a bottle of wine, it is worth of French wine in 1961."	S_T1
"This bottle of wine is placed in my living room, have for a long time."	B_S0
"It is my grandfather bought years ago."	I_S0
"Recently, but was a guest."	I_S0
"After he was thirsty this bottle of wine as a drink is expensive."	I_S0
"My dad was shocked."	I_S0
"Now my father put the bottle is empty, forbade us to receive touch it."	E_S0
 
"The public transportation is playing an increasingly significant role in our lives."	S_T1
"Quite a few people believes that we would beneficial from constructing more railway lines for high-speed trains,while others believes that we should concentrate our attention on upgrading existing public transport."	B_T0
"Personally, I tend to agree with the former view."	E_T0
"It is undeniable that facilitating our existing public transport would benefit the cities."	S_M1
"Initially, for the safety of citizens, we can avoid the danger of aged apparatus."	B_S0
"To be more specifically, these old instrument could be replaced by higher technological parts."	I_S0
"However, improving these transport would cause traffic congestion."	I_S0
"The construction would limit the wide of road and people would have to drive private cars due to the maintenance of public transport."	I_S0
"So there would be more cars and less road, which lead to the traffic jam."	E_S0
"By contrast, there are lots of merits for establishing new railway lines."	S_M1
"First of all, it can  release the financial burden of large number of people."	B_S0
"In other words, people could take trains to go to work by living in the surrounding cities rather than the central city."	I_S0
"Because the rental expenses are much higher in the central city."	I_S0
"On top of that, it can decrease the noise pollution in the cities."	I_S0
"Improving existing public transport would bother the residents who living in a near area."	I_S0
"That is to say that the new railway lines could be constructed in the countryside with larger room and keep away from the cities."	E_S0
"Overall, I believe that spending large sums of money on constructing new railway lines would be better than improving existing public transport."	S_C2
 
"Some people hold a point that children are expected to form a awareness of competition,while others emphasize the cooperation in children's growth."	S_T1
"I think both of the two point would go to extremes,which is not helpful."	S_T0
"The main function of the sense of competition is to make the children try their best to strive and become better than peers."	B_M0
"The cooperated spirit may have a positive influence on youngsters when they face some difficult problems."	E_M0
"Not only working together could solve problems more efficiently and quickly,but also it could strengthen children's friendship and communication ability."	S_S2
"Only passing on the sense of competition can stifle children's creativity and they are not able to solve problems in different ways."	S_M0
"However if parents just teach they to cooperate with others may cause they could not finish the work alone,which form a awareness of dependency."	B_S1
"In my opinion ,both of the two characters are supposed to instill to children,reconciling them to help children handle their tasks and strive for the best."	E_S1
 
"Globally, diverse career can be specifically divided into different type of work; particular jobs may contain extremely diverse work to do or inconceivably monotonous tasks to finish."	B_I0
"Concerns like whether many different sorts of tasks or tasks that are akin to one another will satisfy workers most."	E_I0
"From my perspective, I prefer the point that many different types of work to do during the workday."	S_T1
"Admittedly, doing similar tasks the whole day will apparently be more relaxing and less challenging."	S_M0
"In other words, being sucked in things that are precedented will undoubtedly lower the pressure of unfinishing worl due to the difficulties and gey more stable wages without any errors to make due to familarity."	B_S1
"However, if one really master the career, such concerns will be eliminated easily for one will definately be confident about his or her own skills."	E_S1
"In the first place, doing "colorful" tasks can promote the interest of workers."	S_M0
"That is to say, by confronting all variety of challenges and facing all sorts of new things, workers will obviously get interested as a sense of innovation and satisfaction come along; consequently, workers will be more willing to do such work due to the freshment of work, personal enjoyment and a feeling of never get bored."	B_S1
"Instead, if a particular work is done day by day, workers should have sucked and loosed the concentration and hence decresed the productivity due to lack of satisfaction of the work."	E_S1
"Secondly, doing different tasks enable workers to get higher salaries, hence satisfaction."	S_M0
"That is, as far as the public know, someone with more skills or capability will undoubtedly have less job mobility and more appreciation due to they can easily transfer to another kind of work if possible; thus, a firm will be more likely to hire such person with higher wages, for his or her unsubstitutional value and even unprecedentedly diverse abilities."	B_S0
"My uncle is such person who get strong satisfaction."	I_S0
"He was a successful manager of an international company not only for he once majored in business or economic, but also due to his amazingly diverse ability like computer programming, accounting and managing; consequently, not to mention his fertile salaries or bonus."	E_S0
"In conclusion, workers will obviously be more satisfied when they have many different types of tasks to do during the work day, for the durable interest and demanding wages."	B_C1
"Getting involved in similar tasks can never outweigh the benefits of diverse work, only when one have his or her own world rocked by interest and satisfaction will he or she find the meaning of the life and own value, so come and try such work!"	E_C1
 
"The line graph indicates the amount of energy consumed in the USA during the period from 1980 to 2030."	S_I0
"According to the line graph,fossil fuels including petrol & oil, coal, and natural gas are consued mostly by 2030."	S_M1
"Wherein, the consumption amount of petrol and oils increases gradually from 35 quadrillion units (QUs) which ranks the first in terms of energy consumption, and that of coal (natural gas) rises from 15 (20) to 30 (25)"	B_S0
"QUs, respectively."	I_S0
"Nuclear, solar/wind, and hydropower are considered as environmental friendly energy."	I_S0
"In this case, the consumption of nuclear and solar/wind is slight grows up while that of hydropower fluctuates around 3.5 QUs."	I_S0
"It is predicted that the usage of nuclear and solar/wind will have an subtle rise and the consumption of hydropower might remain stable in the future."	E_S0
"To sum up, the consumption of fossil fuels is goes up and petrol and oil takes the lead."	S_M1
"wheras, the usage of environmental friendly energies have slight increase but much less significantly."	S_S2
 
"There remain little doubt that the poor students are less possible to gain the chance to the university, it may be a resolution that university should give students in poverty a priority."	B_T0
"Personally, I totally agree with that."	E_T0
"Admittedly, giving a lower admission requirements to those students in poor area may not fair to other students who come from mordern cities."	S_M0
"However, those rural area students are unlikely to access the equal edution and the qualification to the university compared with students in cities."	S_S2
"It is clear that this policy would give the students in difficulty a chance to become better."	S_M0
"Those who have requirement and ability to gain knowledge but restricted by area or financial condition will absolutely benefit from this policy."	B_S1
"As a result , once they have an oppotunity, they would make more effort in their majors in the university, which can not only benefit themselves and to live a better life, their academic performance will also be useful for the development of country."	E_S1
"Apart from that, the students from rural area would also give back to the society."	S_M0
"Being different from those who treat everything for granted, the students who recieve the policy without which they are not accessible to college, are more likely to show appreciation to kindness."	B_S1
"More precisely, some people take charitable actions mainly because they are helped by others and this will stimulate them to give back to where they were born and take actions helping more people."	E_S1
"It keeps my arguement that it is the opportunities given by university that the rural students can perform well in the compus and would also give back to the society ,being grateful."	S_C2
 
"It is a tend that a lot of people like to go to gyms and take physical exercise."	B_I0
"They belive that doing phycial execise can help them forget the diffculties from their work."	E_I0
"But some other people do not agree with it, these people choose methods like watching a movie or reading a book help them relax after one day's hard work."	S_T1
"It is not denying that doing physical exercise can help us get relaxed."	S_M1
"During the exercise, thinking is not the main activity anymore."	S_S2
"However, watching a movie or reading a book is a more efficient way to relax."	S_M1
"People may get tired after physical exercise, but it never happens after watching a movies, because physial exercise consumes much energes."	B_S1
"In theater, we always sit on soft chairs,"	E_S1
"Further more,"	S_S2
 
"With the development of our sociaty,students are facing more and more stress,which cause the increacing number of students leaving school with negative thoughts on studying."	S_T0
"It has a bad influence on students'mentel healthy."	B_S0
"So improving the situation is needed."	I_S0
"First,schools have to let the students to have some time to release themselves."	I_S0
"They can organize more out -class activities to let students to take part in instead of doing planty of homework."	I_S0
"Too much time spent beside the desk is not good for both health and study."	I_S0
"second,parents should not give students too much pressure."	I_S0
"Parents always hope their kids to live a better life in the future,so sometimes they may push their kids too hard."	I_S0
"They should let their kids learn by themselves."	I_S0
"It's time to let it go."	I_S0
"Third, students should find some ways to relax by themselves."	I_S0
"Also they have to make their mind stronger."	I_S0
"For example, they can take a break per 40 minutes and then go back to study when they are doing homework."	I_S0
"And laking of sleep can make people depressed."	I_S0
"Sometimes students feel sad just because they did not get enough sleep,and their mind become sensetive."	I_S0
"So enough sleep is quite improtant."	I_S0
"Education is a serious thing to every country."	I_S0
"If studends  feel depressed, then"	E_S0
 
"I think this view is very true."	B_I0
"Because the roads were so smooth when I was young, my father took only 10 minutes to get to work by motorcycle."	I_I0
"Now it takes him nearly 20 minutes to drive to work because of traffic jams."	E_I0
"I think the government can do the following to reduce people's use of cars."	S_M2
"First, separate work and school hours."	B_S0
"This can effectively reduce the flow of people."	I_S0
"The decrease in the flow of people leads to a decrease in the flow of cars, thus solving the problem of traffic jams."	I_S0
"Second, the government can agree and encourage the use of Shared bikes, such as the more time you spend on your bike, the more you can redeem some daily necessities."	I_S0
"Third, create an app for taking buses and carpooling."	I_S0
"Offer more discounts on buses and carpooling, and offer annual cards and other activities to get people to spend."	I_S0
"If the service is good, people will like in this way."	I_S0
"Last but not least, the number of cars per person should be strictly controlled."	I_S0
"There is a misconception that cars are a necessity."	I_S0
"Many people see buying cars as a sign of their wealth."	I_S0
"The government could also raise the price of oil, which would reduce the use of cars at the source."	E_S0
"I hope the government can take effective measures to reduce traffic congestion, and people can also contribute to the road."	S_C2
 
"Why we buy goods?"	B_I0
"the traditional answer is need or use."	E_I0
"However, this years,we find a very abnormal phenomenon that people will buy things they don't need even they can't afford."	S_T0
"What are the reasons of this novel but not pleasure behavior?"	S_T1
"I guess some reasons follow:
First of all, it may be people's sence of fasion and beauty."	S_T0
"everyone loves the pretty things or cool style things, even they are not very useful."	B_S1
"People not buy them for use, they just enjoy their beauty or cool."	E_S1
"Another reason is worse than first."	S_M0
"I think sometimes it is because people want to compare with each others."	B_S0
"Such as"Oh, I will buy this one to show my wealth!" or "This stange one will make me very happy when I bring it to her.""	I_S0
"To be honest, it is terrible."	E_S0
"Last but not least, I also think that maybe the ad or market should be to blame."	S_M0
"They overtalk their goods to let people make a decision."	B_S0
"it is until people pay the bill and take the goods back to hourse that they have realized they did the bad thing."	I_S0
"And now, everything is too late."	E_S0
"To prevent people form having this problem, I think we should teach our children in school with right idears, tell them what is necessary when they are young may prevent they silly behaviour when they are old."	S_M0
"And we also should enforce market to remove some overwords in order to keep comsumer's rights."	S_S2
"These are my idears, thank you."	S_C2
 
"It is adimited that the we are living in a society based on consuming."	S_I0
"As a adverse result, some people tend to spend a large amount of money on something they can not afford."	S_T0
"The phenomenon would not only has negetive impact on people in debt but also leads to a series of social problems."	S_T1
"Influenced by the wonderful advertisements showing how rich people live, a large number of people may lose their mind and ingore their economic capability."	S_M1
"In order to satisfy vanity, they chose to shopping in debt."	B_S1
"Nevertheless, lacking of self-cognition is another important reason of this appearance, which may drive people buy goods unaffordable."	E_S1
"To address this issue, government ought to restricted advertisment which may induce consumer over-consumtion."	S_M1
"In addition, people themselves need to be rational and distinguish their ability in consumption."	B_S0
"Moreover, this problem is a result of improper self-cognition, while a good educational patterns can be applyed in people's childhood in schools."	I_S0
"Learning how to manage their money well would have a positive influence on their consumption habits."	E_S0
"To sum up, a proper and promptly education chould handle this issue."	S_C2
 
"At present, some scientists and tourists are willing to go to some places which remote from our habitates."	B_T1
"In my opinion,it is not a good idea for us, in the other word, the people go to remote natural environments' disadvantages outweigh its advantages for the development."	E_T1
"Some people told me that doing researchs or travelling in remote natural places could help us to acquire more knowledges of mystery enviroments."	B_S0
"People should expand more recognise and get more new things from new places."	I_S0
"Nevertheless,in terms of  environmental protection, it would not be a good plan."	I_S0
"Since the remote natural environments are discovered, they would be polluted by people, and some new resources might be used."	I_S0
"In addition, a lot of animals might reduce constantly, such as  penguins or polar bears."	I_S0
"If the South Pole is a sightseeing for tourists, most of travel agency would attrack a lot of travellers."	I_S0
"The agency would renew the pure area as they want."	I_S0
"They would like to do something like building new restaurants, adding more routes or taking photoes with wildlife by charges."	I_S0
"That would impact the balance of between wild environments and human's activities."	I_S0
"In addition, the scientists  research in some new place, which might cause any problems, such as new virus or new disease."	I_S0
"If people catch a new disease,they might die."	I_S0
"So that the population would decrease, and effect gravely of the world."	I_S0
"Overall, both scientists and tourists go to romote natua"	E_S0
 
"Some experts believe that children get more advantages to begin learning a foreign language at primary school than secondary school."	S_T0
"This may because they think children could stay in and the foreigh language may become their strengthes, when they get older."	B_S0
"However, some disadvantages are like, children may not familiar enough with their mother language, so they may mixed up."	I_S0
"In my point of view, i think the advantages doesnot outweight the disadvantages."	I_S0
"Firstly, like i mentioned before, children may mixed foreign language and mother language up, espeically in eropean countries as they have some similar words or garmmers."	I_S0
"Secondly, children may get pressure when studing a new language."	I_S0
"In primary school, children are more likey to have ages from 6-12, they are not teenegers and its maybe their first time to get into school."	I_S0
"Therefore, they need time to get used to the school stuffs, for example, subjects like maths, which is hard, relationships with friends, behavoir and effort that expected from both parents and teachers."	I_S0
"Thirdly, children are still in their 'happy childhood', so they may more likely to deelop other skills, for instance, a new sports like swimming skill, rather than learning a new language."	I_S0
"Finally, the understanding are not deep and structured."	I_S0
"Also, they didnot have a efficient method to learn language."	I_S0
"As a result, children may find diffficlut and dislike learning the language, which we donot want to see obvriosly."	I_S0
"Although, learning a foreign language at primany school has the benefits, i think the shortcomings are far more obvious and need to be considered."	E_S0
 
"Three bar charts give information about average  years of schooling ,the number of scientists and  technicians and the cost of research and  development in developing and industrialized  countries from 1980 to 1990 ."	S_I0
"As can be seen from the charts ,the various  statistics of industrialized countries were  overwhelmingly higher than that of developing  countries ."	B_M0
"In 1980 ,the average years of schooling in  developing countries was about 3 years ,and in  following 10 years ,that only had a slight increase ."	E_M0
"However ,the average year experienced a rise from  about 9 in 1980 to 10 in 1990 ."	S_S2
"On the other hand ,there was around 10 per 1000  people who were scientists and technicians in  developing countries ,with an about 5 grow by  1990 ."	S_M0
"By contrast ,the number of scientists and  technicians in industrialized countries almost  doubled to about 70 per 1000 people ."	B_S2
"In third chart ,to spending on research and  development ,comparing with the decrease from  about 50 to 30 billions in developing countries by  1990 ,the data of industrialized countries jumped  from 150 to 350 billions $
 To sum up ,the charts show an overall increase in  participation in education and science from 1980  to 1990 ,and the spending trend of A and B is  opposite ."	E_S2

"Next is Russia for 1038, 856.7 in Japan and 689.8 in India."	B_S1
"We can see that the consumption of Germany was higher than it generated, which is 582.5 billion kWh."	E_S1

"The line chart illustrate the percentage of work force in the unemployment rates from march 1993 to march 1999 in the US and Japan."	S_I0
"From the chart we can see that the percentage of work force has a increase considerably between march 1993 and march 1999 in the US from 7.0 % to 5.0 % which is the least rate in that period."	S_M2
"A stable proportion can be seen from the line chart at 5.0 % in US, which is almost the same rate as that in Japan from march 1998 to march 1999."	B_S2
"There is a great declining in the proportion of unemployment rates in the work force at the same period in Japan from 2.5 % to 5.0 % which is the largest rate from march 1998 to march 1999."	I_S2

"Prior to decades ago, diverse education systems were founded in the need of human progress, some of which are preserved and even are being applied in current academic world, while others are eliminated due to inherent flaws."	S_T1
"I believe that teachers have more enormous impact on students’ further development than studying with parents."	S_T0
"One of the recent trends in education is that the classroom environment should cater towards individual needs, goals and interests."	S_M1
"In that, learning with parents illustrates its advantages as an inquiry-based education system where parents are in control with knowledge-output, customizing for their children."	B_S0
"However, rather than consuming a large amount of parents' valuable time on which they can spend earning a better living for the entire family, leaving educating children to the professionals seems to be a more sensible move."	I_S0
"Admittedly, the majority of parents are not legitimate educators, so their misuse of knowledge is likely to wrong children, leading to unimaginable consequence regarding children's future decisions."	E_S0
"In fact, the existence of modern educational module – learning with teachers -- is proofed by its unique benefits."	S_M1
"First, competition and collaboration are two essential abilities in the modern social construct, which can only be learnt in a team or among a group of people, and teachers play an indispensable part in this education."	B_S0
"Schools provide a mini-social environment for students to interact with each other for the purpose of understanding the social paradigm in advance, including basic communication, confidence, sympathy and so forth under the supervision of teachers who can make correction whenever students are in trouble."	I_S0
"Each single experience they encounter with peers is the most effective teaching presentation a student can get, while home learning can never suffice."	E_S0
"Overall, in my opinion, the role of teachers cannot be replaced by any form of education, and such way of learning should be encouraged under every circumstance, and the value of teachers should be recognized by both individuals and the society."	S_C2
 
"More and more people, in the past thirty yeras, choose to drive themselves because it is convenient, comfortable and private."	S_I0
"But at the same time, because of this, many of the world's major metropolises, naming Beijing, Shanghai, New York and London, have become famous cities for their notorious traffic jams."	S_T1
"In my opinion, the reasons for urban blocking are not only the increase in the number of private cars, but also the problems of relatively underdeveloped urban public transportation and the chaotic urban planning."	B_M0
"First of all, in the cities, the rate of increase of the migrant population far exceeds that of the number of private cars."	E_M0
"In this case, if the diversity of public transportation modes, such as subway, buses, and online car-hailing, cannot keep up with the demand of urban people, congestion will inevitably be caused, especially during rush hours."	S_S2
"In addition, the lag of urban road planning is also a factor causing the traffic congestion."	S_M0
"The route plannings in many cities are decades old, which is far from enough to meet the rapid and complex transportation needs of modern times."	B_S1
"For instance, problems such as roads being too short, dead ends and lacking of traffic hub are all part of the government's road planning."	E_S1
"Hence, I think the government can take at least two measures to control the number of private cars."	B_C0
"First, traffic restriction based on the license plate is a good control means."	I_C0
"During restricted hours, people have to take public transport; when many people ride in one bus or subwaytrain, the road is much wider."	E_C0
"Second, the new urban planning map should be issued quickly, so that the traffic of the whole city can be extended in all directions, so that the congestion degree can also be alleviated."	S_S2
 
"Nowadays a great number of students are quiting from the schools as some negative thoughts on studying effecting them."	S_T1
"Knowlege become useless in some field ."	B_S0
"What causes this phenomenon ?"	I_S0
"In the first place , social values are distorded by some so called successful person."	I_S0
"Those people who can abtain  social resource easily and live a wealthy life spead their thoughs about usless of the konwlege which  attracts many young students to follow their steps to leave the school."	I_S0
"Secondly , by the economics booming of our society parents sometime do not want to support their children's fee ."	I_S0
"As even after graduated from school ,their children also have to face the reality that it is hard to find a good job in the big city ,surfering low salary for years which may lower than a farmer ."	I_S0
"So the students may force to make a living before they graduate from school."	I_S0
"Finally the couse of the school may be boring and old ."	I_S0
"Students can not get right skill when they are facing the real world ."	I_S0
"That may cause them complaining about the education which will inflence the new comers."	I_S0
"From my point of view , the position of the researchers and the teachers should be raised like pop star or famous bussiness ."	I_S0
"Their positive thoughts can be accepted by more parents and the young students ."	I_S0
"Education should be improved to encourage students to touch the real society ,they will find what they need and what kind of the knowlege is needed."	E_S0
 
"As society is developing very rapid , the topic about people how to choose better working has triggered intense controversy in the realm."	S_T1
"Some believe that choose self-employed is good ,whereas other differ in opinion,suggesting that work for a company or organisation are better."	S_T0
"In this essay, i aim at discussing why  might this be the case,what could be disadvantages of being self-employed and put up my own opinion."	O
"There are several reasons why this occasion happen."	S_M1
"In the past,job division was simple, and it was not difficult for people to choose."	B_S0
"However, due to the increasing job categories, an enormous number of companies arise, which seems similar but greatly differ from each other."	I_S0
"This increasingly complicated give rise to so much confusion to job candidates that they are not sure which job suits best suits them."	I_S0
"In other word, a range of youngsters choose to be self-employed to earn more income for themselves."	I_S0
"But my point is that it's more stable to work for a company or organisation."	E_S0
"There are too many drawback of being self-employed."	S_M1
"Firstly, Starting your own business requires a lot of obstacles,to be exact, If you don't have a lot of experience, you will fail."	B_S0
"As a result, it's a hard thing to be self-employed."	I_S0
"Secondly,Starting your own company requires a lot of relationships and resources, to be exact, it's not suitable of youngsters,perhaps people can choose to work for a company first."	I_S0
"As a result, in the future who can built own canpany better."	E_S0
"In conclusion, according to previous analysis, i believe that it's more stable to work for a company or organisation."	S_C2
 
"The majority of children learn to differenciate between right and wong at an early age, which would influence their personality in the adulthood as well."	S_T1
"There has been a controversy about whether punishment can help them learn this distinction."	B_S0
"Personally, I hold the view that punishment can be an effective education approach if used in an appropriate way."	I_S0
"Children are not mentally mature, so they have no idea of right and wrong."	I_S0
"And they tend to imitate those wrong behaviours such as violence and bullying from the media."	I_S0
"Parents, being their guardians, are supposed to teach them the correct behaviours and educate them to become law-abiding citizens."	I_S0
"On the contrary, If there were no penalty and bonus mechanism, children might be confused about the boundary of right and wrong, which would have invisible negative effects later in their life."	I_S0
"It is noteworthy that there should be a limit to any punishment."	I_S0
"Corporal punishment may leave emotional trauma to those children."	I_S0
"Other methods, therefore, can be utilised instead of physical torture."	I_S0
"Children should be punished without getting severely hurt if they commit a fault."	I_S0
"Moreover, they can learn a significant lesson of life through punishment as long as it is reasonabe and feasible."	I_S0
"For instance, doing house chores is a beneficial way to punish children when they are ill-behaved, and it would also enhance their awareness of keeping a clean environment."	I_S0
"In conclusion, punishment is vital in children's process of learning right and wrong."	I_S0
"But parents should pay attention to the way of punishment."	I_S0
"They can use a variety of other methods instead of corporal punishment."	E_S0
 
"The picture give us some information about in 1999, the different levels of post-school qualifications in Australia and also showed the proportion of men and women who held them ."	B_T1
"We can see that when it comes to Skilled vocational diploma, Postgraduate dipoloma and master's degree, males who get them are far more than famales, the biggest gap is at Skilled vocational diploma, it is about eighty percent, the smallest is about twenty percent in Master's dgree."	E_T1
"And about Undergraduate diploma and Bachelor's dgree, the amount of famales are more than males, but compared with other three, the gap are smller."	S_M2
"In Undergraduate diploma is thirty-five percent and in Bchelor's degree are the smallest of all the data, it is five percent."	B_S2
"In a word, in most levels of post-school qualifictions in Australia, males who held them are more than famlaes, and in otners post-school, famales are more than males but the gap is mot so big."	E_S2
 
"I think there are a few reasons about why many young students are leaving school with negative thoughts on studying."	S_T0
"First is they are not interested in it."	B_S0
"There are always many children prefer playing computer games to study,or playing with friends outside but not  stay at home and read."	I_S0
"They cannot find the joy of studying."	I_S0
"Maybe they can try some books that they are interested in,then sit and read for a couple of time,or when they are about to read,ask a friend to read together and talk with each other when reading."	I_S0
"That will be more funny for them."	I_S0
"And second is they think studying is useless."	I_S0
"Nowadays,many people who has much knowledge are usually not able to find a job,and the people who are rich or have much more power always live in an easier life."	I_S0
"The children see or hear this,are easily to think that studying is useless."	I_S0
"I think parents should tell them this:studying hard is not for you to  living in a life you want,to become rich or powerful in future."	I_S0
"Studying is for yourself,for you can say NO to the jobs you don't want to do,for you can live for yourself."	I_S0
"And the last is,they may be treated in a different way by the teacher because they are not good at some subjects."	I_S0
"That would make them feel upset or angry,and kids are easy to be influenced by how they feel."	I_S0
"Then change into do not want to see the teacher and don't want to go to school."	I_S0
"Maybe change a situation is a good way for the kids."	I_S0
"In conclution,not interested,useless,and the different way they are treated,all these would make them leave school with negative thoughts on studying."	E_S0
 
"In contemporary society, high school graduaters can always be caught in a delima of whether having a gap year for working or traveling, or simply going to university after the summer vacation."	S_T1
"In my perspective, I think it's better to use the summer vacation to have a short brief and then head into the university."	B_S0
"Some students think that if they can take a one year off  to travel, it is a great oppertunity for them to experience a brand new way of life and cultral."	I_S0
"By traveling, they are able to broaden their horizons and have a more open mind, which are essential and useful for their studies in university."	I_S0
"What is more, some educationlists attach great importence to working experience because they believe this is an effective way to learn some practical knowledge."	I_S0
"For example, by working in service system, they can have an awear of the difficulties of some occupations which allows them to realize the importance of gratitude and hard working."	I_S0
"However, some experts believe that there is no need for high school graduaters to have a gap year for travel or work."	I_S0
"Firstly, it is possible that they may get exhuasted after a long period of working or traveling, which is not helpful to their later on study."	I_S0
"Secondly, they are not mature enough to takle the emergence situations that may come across."	I_S0
"This is probably true to some extent."	I_S0
"Personlly, I think that there are advantages to both choice."	I_S0
"But after weighting all the pros and cons of both sides, I agree that it may be better to go to university first."	I_S0
"Frankly speaking, there are still plenty of oppertunities to experience life by travellling around or having a job after finishing our study, after which we may have a better views of the world around us."	E_S0
 
"After the industrializaton, the workers bacome an undispensiable part of the world."	S_I0
"How to let the workers to work in an more effective way and how to make the worker happier during their work time are widely concerned by a lot of people."	B_T1
"I think it is obviously that the workers are more satisfied when they have many diierent types of task to do during the workday than they only do similar tasks all day along."	I_T1
"Here are some reasons to support my view."	E_T1
"First, different types of tasks can prevent the worker from feeling boring of the similar work."	S_M1
"Everyone in the world likes to learn something new, to explore the things we don't know."	B_S0
"When workers are faced with multi-works."	I_S0
"The can know something new or get some different feelings which they haven't experienced before."	I_S0
"That will make them feel interesting and be more satisfied with their work."	I_S0
"On the contrast, if the do the same thing everyday, that a really bad and monotonus sense for them."	I_S0
"Even listening to a beautiful music for all day will let us don't want to hear it any more, not to mention the baring work the workers are facing."	E_S0
"On top of that, diiferent types of of task make the workers think they can achieve a great deal of things."	S_M1
"No one wants to do the same thing all day for that's seem that he can only do this thing."	B_S0
"If ther get many types of task, they may think they are versatile and it brings them a kind of achievement."	I_S0
"This will absoutly make them feel satisfied."	I_S0
"Supposing that you are now work in a IT cpmpany, and your leader give you a lot of things to do."	I_S0
"You may design different programms and prove you can make it."	I_S0
"That will make you feel much better than just recite the same work you type in da after day, which make you feel you are useless."	I_S0
"This example strongly demonstrate that they will be more satisfied if they are allowed to do different kinds of work"	E_S0
"In a nutshell, giving workers different types of work can make them feel more interesting as well as a kind of fufillment."	B_C1
"So  they are more satisfied with their work under such a condition."	E_C1

"As the world changing rapidly, more and more people can benefit from high developing society."	B_T0
"It seems like people nowadays are much happier than people in the past."	E_T0
"However, personally, I strongly believe that people nowadays are actually less happy with their lives compare to the people in the past."	S_T1
"To begin with, people nowadays have more information to process, which make their lives more exhausting than ever."	S_M0
"Due to the limitation of information transaction, people in the past don't have the chance to know too much about world, their livestyle is simple because they only need to do works base on their current knowledge."	B_S0
"Comparing to them, people nowdays have much more pressure."	I_S0
"Everyday tons of information bombard us and make us revalue everything around us."	I_S0
"For example, a report says the top university is xx and another renowned news paper says otherwise."	I_S0
"True and false information weive together and buffle people."	I_S0
"Unlike people in the past, they could satisfy with going into a university, nowadays people would still unhappy about whether the university they came is the bast one."	I_S0
"More information cause less satisfying with life."	E_S0
"Secondly, people nowadays have more targets which make them less happy."	S_M0
"In the past, the major goal of people is to maintain their lives and only satisfy their basic needs, but in the nowadays society, people seek more than sustain basic needs."	B_S0
"To demostrate, people seek fashion dresses, expensive luxuries and everything could make them feel good."	I_S0
"In fact, lots of them are unnessecery purchasing which bacome burden to nowadays people."	I_S0
"Plus, those fashion stuff change over time."	I_S0
"Today's fashion maybe a coat and tomorrow could be a hat."	I_S0
"People always have more to conern, to persue, so actually they are less satisfied than before."	E_S0
"Finally, quick changing represents people nowadays need to do more work so they can correspond with the world."	S_M0
"In the past people could do work slowly, like a peasant could manage his one arce land regularly for this own life but if he is in the nowadays society, he has to do more work, manage more arces of land and hire more people to help organize the land, or he won't be able to catch the quick changing world and be left out."	B_S1
"Thus, people nowadays are forced to rise their work speed to synchronize with the rapidly changing world."	E_S1
"To put into a nut shell, people nowadays are less happy than people in the past because more information bring them more concerns, they have more persuation to make them happy and they have to do more works or be left out by the quick changing world."	S_C2
 
"Good teachers are more important to a child's development than good parents."	S_I0
"Parents and teachers are both important people to a child."	S_M1
"Some people say, "Good teachers are more important to a child's development than good parents.""	B_S1
"However, I do not agree with this statement."	E_S1
""Parents are the first educators of a child.""	S_M1
"Indeed, when a person is born into this world, the first people he is in contact with everyday are his parents, whereas a teacher can only come during a later stage in the child's life, and may leave him after just a few years."	B_S1
"All through the child's childhood and puberty, parents exert a subtle influence on him, teaching him what to look up to and what to become."	E_S1
"In the early years of a child's life, his parents are the ones to teach him the basics of life and the principals of living."	B_S0
"They are the ones to teach him how to pronounce the first word, how to stand up and take a few steps, how to greet elders, and in the process of which, they give him the first glimpse of lifehow learning, strength of character and etiquette are essential to one person."	I_S0
"These are what my father and mother taught me when I was too young to go to school."	E_S0
 
"Today, many people think that to  prepared for school life,orpreparing written books for them to read, reading aloud to them are the best way for children life."	B_S0
"For my point of view, communicating with children is the most valid for parents to get children which age is 3~6 years old  prepared for school life."	I_S0
"My reasons are listed here:
First of all,if you often communicate with you kids ,It strikes me that you can get a perfect relationship with your kids."	I_S0
"Maybe you will not only be their parents , but also become friend,sister or brother."	I_S0
"So  your relationship will more close."	I_S0
"Take an example od mine,my parents always interflow with my,therefore i often share with them what i learn,what i happend today or some intersting things."	I_S0
"Thus i very love my parents."	E_S0
"Moreover,your children can get a good  exercise of communicatng from your chat that can let  them gain a skill of communicating."	S_M2
"To begin with,from your communication,your kids can learn some speaking skill by osmosis so that  your kids can talk to people better that means kids will have not autistic."	B_S0

"When it comes to the arrangement of schol subjects,some people regard history as the subject of the most importance while other people believe that subjects about science and technology seem more important in today's world."	S_T1
"Personally,I think history,as well as science and technology,all play an essential role in children's growth."	B_S0
"People who think highly of history may hold the idea that,students could get a better understanding of society by learning history,since in the process of studying,they get aware of  how people in the past would behave when being occurred to obstacles,which broadens their horizons and enables them to consider a social problem thoroughly and critically."	I_S0
"In addition,history subject is also a necessary opportunity for students to learn about their national culture,thus leadin to the recognition and confidence on their own nation."	I_S0
"For example,Chinese students are always impressed by the great poet Qu Yuan's patriotism through learning the history of the Warring States period."	I_S0
"In contrast,those who pay more attention to subjects like science and technology might believe that these more practical subjects can prepare students better for the job markets."	I_S0
"With the development of industry and technology,there is an increasing need of technological talents."	I_S0
"Therefore,students who have a better command of knowlegde in science and technology may gain more  opportunities to achieve success."	I_S0
"At the same time,these courses may arouse students' interests of exploring the nature and guide them to make contributions to the improvements of technology and humans' living qualities."	I_S0
"In my opinion,subjects about history and subjects about science and technology are both important in children's life."	I_S0
"Only if students get a good command of these courses can they become a valuable person in the society."	E_S0
 
"Nowadays, there are a wide variety of choices to entertain oneself, espeacially for the young."	S_T1
"More and more people prefer smartphone or Ipad to TV, because people can get more instant information through smartphones."	B_S0
"TV, which used to be the first option to amuse, has been less popular in recent years."	I_S0
"So, in my point of view, too many TV channels are unnecessary, and meanwhile, it may result in a phenomenon that producters produce a lot of poor quality TV programs in order to save the cost and make more profit."	I_S0
"On the contrary, if government control strictly the quality of TV programs, and more rules about television industry can be carried out, the quantity of the TV programs may decrease, but the quality, without saying, would be better."	I_S0
"Under these circumstances, not only the level of entertainment of people  but the feedback of TV programs would increase."	I_S0
"As for most people, TV is only a tool to relax themselves and release their stress, while too many channels may lead people to make choice difficultly."	I_S0
"Moreover, it will raise the sense of anxiety, which eventually make TV lose its own function."	I_S0
"Last but not least, the enormous number of poor quality programs will make people lose confident about the whole TV industry, which may accelerate the vanish of TV."	I_S0
"Because, people are not willing to  watch TV programs in front of TV and transfer to online programs according to other people's comments."	E_S0
 
"Recently, a controvesial topic has aroused a heated debate among people: whether young people nowadays are more likely to spend time and efforts in improving the world than young people in the past?"	B_I0
"Opinion vary from person to person."	E_I0
"Some people claim that they think so."	B_T1
"However, I would satnd on their opposite side and I believe that young people today are less likely to spend their time or efforts in improving the world than young people in the past."	I_T1
"My viewpoint can be elaborated as follow."	E_T1
"First, young people today are more concentrated on their own development than young people in the past."	S_M1
"Nowadays, the pressure of competition become bigger and bigger, the society require young people have enough ability to adapt."	B_S0
"As a result, young people today will be more focus on their own development becasue once they do not focus on their own development of life, they would be easily ignored."	I_S0
"As for young people in the past, they have enough time and energy to improve the world because they do not need to face the competitive society and do not have such high pressure."	I_S0
"For example, when I was in high school, I needed to spend at least one third of a day in school."	I_S0
"After school, I also had to took part in the math courses."	I_S0
"I felt so nervous and tired that I had no more patience to think about improving the world."	I_S0
"However,  in the past, young people have more time because they have less pressure from society."	I_S0
"So they will have more energy to build their homeland and peotect it."	E_S0
"Second, the environment that young people live is more peaceful than young people live in the past."	S_M1
"Today the world is full of peace and the people from every country are very friendly."	B_S0
"However, the wars spread out the every corner of the world in the past."	I_S0
"For example, China today is built very well and young people who live in China are very safe and don't need to think about the problem of improving the world."	I_S0
"However, during the 1940s there were thousands of young people in China joined in the army to protect their homeland from Japan."	E_S0
"All in all, I firmly think young people today are less likely to spend their wom time or efforts in improving the world than young people in the past."	S_C2

"In my opinion I support the former."	E_T0
"Some people think use the technology to monitor the people can help government make the public order for instance prevent the terrorist attack."	S_M1
"If the USA can acquire the terrorists's plan like the time and location and everything that I think the tragedy won't be occurred ."	B_S1
"It is benefit for the people."	E_S1
"Besides it is also good for the residents like who have the state of emergency."	S_M1

"A new supermarket plans to settle in the town named Garlsdon which has a population of 65000."	S_I0
"For the first choice,the supermarket can be suited in the countryside,where is about 12km distant from the 10000 population town named Hindon."	B_T1
"Also,between the railway and main roads ,the location has a convient transportation,which owns more choose than the second situation."	I_T1
"So it can get more quick purchase of fresh goods and more costomers will come due to the transportation."	I_T1
"The supermarket can list diverse variety of goodsto aBesides,the first situation is much far away from the industry,leading to less pollution and noise."	E_T1
"For the second situation ,it may be more closer to the central of the town."	S_M2
"Although with only one transportation to choose ,the second situation has bigger population base."	B_S1
"Suited between Branson(16km) and Cransdon(25km) ,the second suitation has the chance to seize more customers,as the two places has living population about 15000 and 29000."	E_S1

"Having news, music, drama, food, sport ,different people may not have same appetite so that more choices have higher chance to satisfied us."	I_S0
"Apperantly, it is obvious to have a little part of channels which may lack of quality, so it is easy for us to waste of time by watching this kind of TV programme."	I_S0
"Some of them may give us information in a certain field or some of them may show funny stories to cheer sad people up."	I_S0
"Having no use is a way of wasting time whichi equals to wasting our life so it is better for us to have less channels but high-quality than have more useless channels."	I_S0
"In my view, i think the best way to have more choices and high-quality programs is to increase the requirement of broadcasting a show."	I_S0
"First, the government can intervene harder and control the most suitable quantity of TV Channels."	I_S0
"Second, the TV industry should have more competitveness so that more qualified program will be selected."	I_S0
"Finally, the comments of people is the most direct feedback of this Channel."	I_S0
"If a channel received most bad reviews, the Tv Station will reappraise this channel."	I_S0

"As we know, we always have to cooperate with others in order to finish a project."	S_I0
"Some people believe that we should communicate through emails while other believe that to communicate in person is better."	B_T0
"From my perspective, to communicate in person is more beneficial for doing a project."	E_T0
"First, to communicate in person would be efficiently to exchange the opinions."	S_M1
"Although sending the email is really convinient and it would cost nearly no time to receive others' reply, it is still not as efficient as talking to people in front of them."	B_S0
"When people talk face to face, they will realize others' attitude through observing others' face and action."	I_S0
"However, the attitude, which is important for human to understand others efficiently, can not be seen when people watch the screen."	I_S0
"Last year, I perticipated in a project about creating an app."	I_S0

"Second, to communicate in person benefits the cooperation because it can build up the relationship between the members."	S_M1
"As a group, it is important to cooperating."	B_S0
"And build up the strength relation ship between the members can make the group become like a family which is beneficial to discuss the problems without being afraid to annoy anyone."	I_S0
"Thus the cooperation would become more efficiently."	I_S0
"For example, when I prepare the competetion with my teamates, I always tend to talk to them in person."	I_S0
"And one time, I joined a new team, and we cannot fiind a classroom to discuss so we sent the email to each other."	I_S0
"We spent the whole week to discuss but we finished nothing."	E_S0

"He always told me:' This is not neccesary to study for everone.'"	I_S0
"But when he realized something, it's too late."	I_S0

"Working only three days but long hours or working five days but for shourt hours."	I_S0

"Firstly, study is the duty of students, they did not need any money to encourage."	S_M0
"All they need is caring from parents, they do not need any money."	B_S1
"Only caring from parents will bring up children's motivation."	E_S1
"In addition, parents should build up the oppion for children that you are not study for me, it's all good for yourself."	S_M0
"This oppion is will have a good influence for the children, it will be useful after they get in to sosialty."	B_S1
"If parents do this, children can also cultivate by them."	E_S1
"Last but not least, parents earn money outside, is not easy they work very hard, they don't have the duty to provide children money to keep them study better."	S_S2
"Maby it's not believable, so I will give you a example about my oppion."	S_M0
"In my senior school, one child called Jack have the same experience with the Topic."	B_S0
"HIs parent encourage he study by gave he money."	I_S0

1990s."	S_M0
"On average, the percentage of  total land degraded in Europe (23%) was nearly double that of in Oceania (13%)  and over 4 times that of in North America (5%) respectively."	S_S2

"Recently, lots of people in the society support the utility of working with others and function as a group."	B_I0
"Thus, many teachers assign projects that ask students to work with their peers for learning effectiveness."	E_I0
"Many people believe it's a brilliant idea, but personally, I don't think working together is actually that great."	S_T0
"Students should work on the projects alone so that they can study in the most effective way."	S_T1
"To begin with, students work on the projects alone can  learn what they are really interested in to study."	S_M1
"In the group projects, the topic should be agreed by most of the members."	B_S0
"Therefore, in many cases, some students cannot choose what they really want to learn to study on and their study effectiveness is reduced by this reason."	I_S0
"Conversely, if all students can work on what they are really curious about as their individual group topic, their study effectiveness would be maximized."	I_S0
"For instance, I was in a chemistry projectr with other two classmates."	I_S0
"They wanted to do an experiment about burning sugars while I am pretty curious about burning different sorts of metals and plus I already knew what will happen if sugars are burnt, so in this group project I didn't learn anything new at all but wasted lot of time."	E_S0
"Secondly, students that work with others on the projects might rely on the group members instead of learning hard."	S_M1
"Free rides heppen all the times in the group projects."	B_S0
"Some students don't actually study very much or do contribution to the projects as much as they can."	I_S0
"In this situation, their learning effectiveness is really limited due to sharing responsibility with others."	I_S0
"Assume that everybody works alone for themselves, everyone is responsible for their own project and they will put much efforts on it therefore their learning effecitveness is maximized."	E_S0
"To put into a nutshell, students should work on the projects alone for their learning effectiveness because they can focus on what they are really insterested to do and can only rely on themselves instead of seeking others help."	S_C2

"They will feel a bit annoied,and never watch TV programs."	I_S0
"It will bring bad impact for good TV programs."	I_S0
"In conclude,I think it is benifit to have some good TV channels instead of more but poor TV channels."	I_S0
"And,it is not to say more channels must lead to poor programs."	I_S0
"We can also whatch good quality programs."	E_S0

"It easily to leads to contiunes negative effects, which the class and school are fulling with negative atomosphere."	I_S0
"Thirdly, parents usully have a high target for their children."	I_S0
"For examole, many parents will require their children booking lots of extra-class on weekends."	I_S0
"Therefore, even young students are leaving school, they still needs to attend another class rather than have a nice weekends."	I_S0
"Those of reasons maybe are the causes of many students have negative thoughts on their studying."	I_S0
"What should we do to improve this phenomenon, there have two kinds of ways."	I_S0
"For young students, they needs to strengen their mental and phycial health."	I_S0

"These days, people can have the same items from any part of the world, use same technologies, contruct similar buidings, buy costumes of international brands and develop infrastructure which are built and        
designed by international companies."	B_S0
"A number of factors have led to this situation, and, this trend, in my opnion, is greatly desirbable due to various reasons."	I_S0
"To strart with, people can purchase the most international branded items from their home country as almost all global products are available in a country that has allowed free international trades, This situation creates a tough competitive enviroment in the market and companies try to introduce new inventions to attract more people."	I_S0
"So people get better choices of products with higher quality as well as in affordable price."	I_S0
"For example, Toyota, a well known car company of Janpan has a lot of  outlets in India, which is much more helpful for Indians to buy these branded cars without wasting travel expense to Japan."	I_S0

"Nowadays, many student's parents praise their children for their high mark in schoolwork with money."	S_I0
"Altough it can promote students to study harder to get higher scroes, I don't convict that it's a good way."	S_T1
"First, doing like this may mislead the student that thier study purpose is for money rather than gaining knowlege."	S_M1
"Therefore it's not good for fostering their interest of learning so that they may not have dynamic hope to do further study and it's bad for the development of learning creativity and independent."	B_S1
"So once they can't get money, they may get bored with learning quickly."	E_S1
"Second, offering money will indicate the chilren that the importance of money."	S_M1
"It has a negective impact on education of student."	B_S0

"How many classmates would I have?"	I_I0
"Will the student number affect my learning effectiveness?"	E_I0
"Firstly, it is for sure that your learning will be affected by the number of students in the class."	S_M1
"In a communication-focused class, the average time for each student to speak will be divided by the number of students."	B_S0
"Under this circumstance, study with fewer classmates is a reasonable choice to make."	I_S0
"A small class provides more practice time, which includes different interaction patterns."	I_S0
"Therefore, students can either learn from the teacher or other students."	I_S0
"However, the reality is not as idealistic as we thought it would be."	I_S0
"Most of the students could not effectively learn from their classmates."	E_S0
"Another possible influence of the student number is the teaching methodology and student level."	S_M1
"It is an extreme challenge for a teacher to use varieties of interaction patterns to build up a student-centered classroom if the true beginners and the intermediates are mixed in one classroom."	B_S0
"Vice versa, it is also a tough time for pre-intermediates to follow the pace of the advanced learners in the same classroom."	I_S0
"In an effective language classroom, students should be well examined and categorized into different levels."	I_S0
"Then the effectiveness will be improved, especially when equipped with an experienced teacher."	I_S0
"Therefore, the concern of student numbers in a classroom becomes less important compared with the teaching methodology and student level."	E_S0
"In conclusion, the number of students does affect the effectiveness of learning."	B_C1
"However, it is also necessary to take a look at the ability of the teacher and the design of the curriculum."	E_C1
 
"Since communication with others comprises a very essential aspect of our daily life, any alteration in the way we communicate with each other will have a profound effect on our social and professional life."	S_I0
"This essay will first discuss how technology has influenced the way we relate with each other presently and will then address the question of whether this influence has been positive or negative."	O
"There are several ways in which the new communication technology has influenced people’s way of interaction with each other."	S_M1
"Firstly, social media applications have revolutionized the way we communicate."	B_S0
"The reason why many people believe this is that nowadays, you can connect with your family and friends instantly through many social media applications such as the Facebook and twitter applications."	I_S0
"It is also possible to say that people are now more encouraged to share their opinions openly via the Internet."	I_S0
"One good illustration for this is the substantial number of friends that people who use social media applications have in their contact list."	E_S0
"However, the impact of social media in one’s social life may not always be positive."	S_M1
"This is because people are now increasingly abandoning face to face interactions and prefer carrying out their communication behind closed doors."	B_S1

"These are what helped the whloe world to improve."	B_S0
"Coperations between different countries make things esier to be done."	I_S0
"For example, when scientists doing reserachs ,it would be impossible not using the results of previous experiments."	E_S0
"Secondly, people may think it is horrible to be the same, but contries becoming similar dose not mean they would be the same."	S_M0
"The reason why we see today's contries becoming more similar are the same prodcts that we are buying."	B_S0
"But what makes a country different is its tradition."	I_S0
"As long as the traditional cultures exist , countries' different charms would remain."	E_S0

"So I think positively of it."	E_C0
 
"In everyday situations, parents are inclind to award their children's excellent behavior."	S_T1
"For example, school-age children are prvided with money for each high grade."	B_S1
"From my perspective, I consider it appropriate by the following reasons: giving encouragement, developing a wonderful conception, improving the education system's structure."	E_S1
"Firstly, it encourage children to work harder."	S_M2
"To be more specific, money enlarge the sense of achievement in children's heart, letting inspiration go through minds for kids to move on on the way of chasing his dream."	B_S0
"Take me as an example, when in middle school, my parents offered me a scholarship for entering a key class, which help me to strengthen my force into studying."	I_S0

"The following pie chart indicates the essential reasons of  the decreasing production in agricultural land and the table shows, during the 1990s, the effects of three areas in the world."	S_T1
"According to the chart, over-grazing is the most significant reason of the land degradation and its proportion is 35% which is over 1/3 of the chart."	B_S0
"Also, deforestation and over-cultivation are secondary causes which vitally leaded to the land decrease in Europe which accounted for 23% during the 1990s."	I_S0
"Compared with Europe, the situation in North America was better because it was only 5%  of land which was degraded."	I_S0
"It is surprised that there was no over-cultivation in the Oceania which was the best one among these three regions, but the phenomenon of over-grazing was terrible."	I_S0
"It is obvious that the governments of these areas need to solve some problems about over doing something and release several legals to protect the environment in their region."	E_S0
 
"An UK Total School Spending  which includes  5  parts has been changing from 1980s to 2000s."	S_T1

"There has been a striking problem that many young students are leaving schools with negative thoughts on studying."	S_T1
"This phenomenon has become so popular that we must pay more attetion on the casues of why the young students are so tired of study."	B_S0
"From my perspective and experience, I think there are 3 main reasons why students are leaving schools with negative thoughts on studying."	I_S0
"First of all, the leaving shcools students may have lost their confidence in study  so that they perform negative on study and drop schools."	I_S0
"For example, I almost gave up my English study when I can't understand what did the teacher said in class."	I_S0
"However, thanks to my high school English teach, It was her patience that  made me picked up English again."	I_S0

"Last but not least, they may suffer too much pressure from their parents who want them to be the best."	I_S0
"For example, many parents force their children  go to different classes."	I_S0
"Whenteh students can't meet their parents need, they tend to defend and leave school."	I_S0
"Accoding to the reasons above, my suggestions are from 2 aspects."	I_S0
"First of all, students who do not like study should develop their own interst in study and the teaches should give them more patience and time."	I_S0
"For example, we can combine study with something they are fond of to let them feel the charming of study."	I_S0
"Secondly, for their parents, they shouldn't strength their wish on their children, they should let make their own dessions on what they want to learn and do in the future."	I_S0
"In brief, just let the young students have there own option and study with passitive througts instead of negative throughs."	E_S0
 
"It is wide recognized that family is able to influence people's life directly, like the characteristics, hobies, even the development direction in the future."	S_I0
"However, the influence by families is only part of children's life."	S_T1
"In fact, children's life is influenced by many asprcts, including outside, which means, society."	B_T0
"As a result, I partly agree with this statement as it is hard to say which part is bigger."	E_T0
"Children spend plenty of time with their families, so parents are the most available objects that children imitate."	S_M1
"Also, in this age group, children have the greatest protential to learn new things and ideas , which makes them behave just like their parents."	B_S1
"Therefore, the famliy truely have a powerful influence on children."	E_S1
"On the other aspect, when children grow up and enter schools such as kindergarten, they start to get in touth with this kind of people who the children are not familiar with, including peer and older ones."	S_M1
"From then on, they have to connect with outside world, that is, society."	B_S0

"In the reading material, the author introduces the disappearing of the Mayan Empire and proposes three theories to explain it."	S_I0
"In the lecture, however, the professor respctively refuses this view for the following reasons."	S_T1
"Firstly, the reading material argues the fact that the war is the leading explaination, yet the professor asserts that it is impossible."	S_M0
"This is because accroding to the archieologic discovery, the Mayan Empire appeared 5,000 to 6,000 years latter than the invaders."	B_S1
"Also, at that time, other cultures did not have millitaries."	E_S1
"Secondly, the professor then challenges the reading's idea that the empire disappeared because of shortage of crops to support the increasing poppulation."	S_M0
"She insists that this claim is indefensible through pointing out that the Mayan was knowledgable to have various of methods to plant enough crops to support itself."	B_S1
"Even if they did not have good condition to plant, they can move to other places to better do their farming."	E_S1
"Finally, different form the point made in the reading material that the region was drier than now, the professor argues that the fact is just true in the nothern part of the empire."	S_M0

"This means that the children grow up without consideration for others and without any understanding of where their standard of living comes from."	E_T0
"When they get to school age they have not learnt any self-control or discipline."	S_M2
"They have less respect for their teachers and refuse to obey school rules in the way that their parents did."	B_S0
"Teachers continually complain about this problem and measures should be taken to combat the situation."	I_S0
"But I think the solution to the problem lies with the families, who need to be more aware of the future consequences of spoiling their children."	I_S0
"If they could raise them to be considerate of others and to be social, responsible individuals, the whole community would benefit."	E_S0
"Perhaps parenting classes are needed to help them to do this, and high quality nursery schools could be established that would support families more in terms of raising the next generation."	S_C2
"The government should fund this kind of parental support, because this is no longer a problem for individual families, but for society as a whole."	S_S2
 
"Many of us  have recently had a discussion about the size of the TV channel."	S_T1

"There is a trend that countrties become more and more similar for global people using the same products."	S_I0
"With every country becoming alike, the development of the world can be blocked in some ways but it also offer plenty of chances to develop."	S_T0
"To be honest, with the development of technology, our world is going to be smaller and every zone have closer connection with each other."	S_M1
"Therefore, the similarity of every country is unavoidable, which bring a big strick to diversified cultures."	B_S1
"In the meanwhile, it may decrease the creativity of everywhere."	E_S1

"Recycling is so simple to do that everyone cando it,but why many people resist the practice？"	S_I0
"I think it is ofen because they think either that it is harder than it is or that the items they fail to recycle will e of little consequence."	B_T0
"To make people  recycle more of their waste not only mandatory laws must be put in place but also education programs are necessary as a key tool for growing recycling rates."	E_T0
"New waste management rules have become a legal requirement  in many cities which see the need to punish those who throw away recyclable materials."	S_M1
"Although suvch rules may differ fro city to city,generally they mean that households will be legally required to separate all rubbish into different bins for recycling, on penalties of fines."	B_S0
"In other words,such rules are designed to act as adeterrent and encourage people to abide by the established recycling standards."	I_S0
"So, to some extent goverments measures are justifed since by recycling, people will be protecting the enviroment,and as a  result, protectig public health as well."	E_S0
"And that explains why some people say that the only way to increase recycling is for goverments to make it a legal requirement to minimize or eliminate the uncontrolled dispersal of waste materials into the
enviroment."	S_M1
"Accordingly,if everyone takes it seriously,this legal requirement could lead to a tidy and healthy enviroment."	B_S0
"At the same time,goverment sponsored recycling education programs can be a useful way to increase recycling by changing human behavior and creating an enviroment friendly culture."	I_S0
"Among other things for all sectors concerned to do is explain, inform, motivate and persuade people to recycle 
ffor public benefits."	I_S0
"For example, in school educators may ask students to remember a list of what is recyclable and what is not,and therby to sort out waste at home."	I_S0
"Through news media, people may be taught to understang the importance of the 3 R s in a thro away society."	I_S0
"Overall,the point of education 
is to let people know that recycling is everyone business beacause if they miss that point, recycling is likelyt to become nobody's business."	I_S0
"All in all,it is possible to increase recycling by let people follw the rules."	I_S0
"It will be simple to recycle by the goverments'encouragement."	E_S0
 
"The number of  students who did four different things after leaving school among graduate and post graduate students (excluding full-work) in 2008 are illustrated in the diagrams."	B_I0
"It is clear that most of students in both two groups decided to keep studying in the future, while the students in both postgraduate and graduate groups who did voluntary work were the least."	E_I0
"Looking at the information in more detail, the number of students who did further study in graduate group is 29665, compared to 17735 for part-time work and 16235 for unemployment."	S_M1
"The individuals who decided to do voluntary work are the least in graduate group, with only 3500."	S_S2
"In postgraduate group, there are 2725 students continued to study after leaving school, while the students who took some part-time job are 2535."	S_M1

"The two diagrams give information about the stages and equipment of cement-making and concrete production."	B_I0
"In the first diagram, we can see that limestones and clay are put separately at the beginning."	I_I0
"Next, the two types of materials are poured into a crusher that changes them to a pile of powder."	I_I0
"Soon afterwards, the powder goes into a mixer and then into a rotating heater to receive sufficient heating."	I_I0
"Finally, cement is produced by a grinder when the heating process is over."	E_I0
"There are several bags used to hold the cement."	S_T1
"Moving on to the next diagram concerning concrete production, As it's shown, concrete production is much easier."	S_M2
"In a way, it only included one step, which is mixing cement, water, sand and gravel all together with a concrete mixer."	B_S1
"The proportion contains 50% of gravel, 25% of sand, 15% of cement and 10% of water."	E_S1
"In conclusion, the two diagrams tell us the materials, stages, and equipment of cement-making and concrete production."	S_C2
"And Concrete production is simpler."	B_S1
"Maybe in real life, both the process of cement-making and concrete production are much more detailed."	E_S1
 
"The two charts show where students went after completing undergraduate and postgraduate degrees respectively."	S_T1
"From the first chart, we see that the number of graduate students who chose not to enter full- time work in 2008 was, in total, around 67, 000."	B_S0
"Of those, the highest proportion chose to further their studies with a postgraduate program at 29, 665 students."	I_S0
"Secondly, the number of students who went into a part- time job is close to the number of students who failed entirely to find one, at 17, 735 and 16, 235 respectively."	I_S0
"Finally, 3, 500 students chose to enter voluntary work."	I_S0
"The second chart shows the destination of postgraduate students."	I_S0
"We can see that while the overall number of students is obviously lower, the proportion of students’ life choices is roughly similar."	I_S0
"Hence, the majority of postgraduates went on to study more, with 2, 725 people choosing this option."	I_S0
"There is a slight divergence with part- time work (2, 535) being higher than unemployment (1, 625) but the general trend remains."	I_S0
"Finally, as with graduates, a small minority (345) chose to pursue voluntary work."	E_S0
 
"People, in some countries, prefer to have a fast and extensive rail communication while others think that improving the existing road transportation system is far more important and that is why more budget should be spent on roads."	S_I0
"This essay discusses both views and includes my opinion before drawing a reasonable conclusion."	O
"On the one hand, people in favour of having a speedy and reliable train communication system mainly base their ground on the fact that trains can carry a great number of passengers and goods at a time and can remarkably reduce the traffic congestion."	S_M1
"Rail communication is safer, faster and can connect cities and towns that build a better communication system than the conventional road transport system, according to these people."	B_S0
"Furthermore, locomotives are already famous in many countries and have greatly improved communications there."	I_S0
"Due to such advantages, people often opine that more money should be allocated for constructing new train lines."	I_S0
"For instance, train system in China has a groundbreaking contribution to improving its overall communication system and many countries have started adopting this model."	E_S0
"On the other hand, public transport system plays an essential role for interconnecting the different parts of the cities and the highest percentage of people use this system to travel to different places."	S_M1

"The first reason that can be seen by every person is that some children are not very outgoing, and if the school makes these activities compulsory, they may find it difficult to accept facing strangers and compulsory courses may lead to students' resistance and unwillingness to accept relevant content in the future."	B_S1
"Another factor that we must consider is that adding these courses to required courses may take up students' academic time,because most of these activities are outside the practice will take up more time than other disciplines."	E_S1
"however,as far as ,i am concemed,there are many advantages to adding compulsory courses to compulsory courses."	S_M1

S_M1
"There's no doubt that the knowledge taught in the class of Science and Technology are more useful and it is a definite factor that people who major in the History are difficult in finding a satisfied job."	B_S1

"In the lecture, the professor is skeptical about idea of reading passage that large pterosaurs were incapable of powered flight."	S_I0
"The professor instead argues"	O
"Firstly, in the reading passage, ancient reptiles such as pterosaurs were probably cold blooded and were incapable of producing enough energies for flying."	S_M0
"On the contrary, the professor says that pterosaurs had a dense, hair-like covering which was typical of hot blooded animals that metabolism can able to supply the energy required for powered flight."	S_S2
"The professor then opposes the reading passage idea that pterosaurs were too heavy to stay aloft for any length of time."	S_M0
"By starting 	the bones of pterosaurs were hollow instead of solid."	B_S1
"Therefore, although they had large body frames."	E_S1
"Finally, the professor disproves the idea that pterosaurs lacked the big, powerful muscles in their back legs to run fast enough or jump high enough to launch themselves into the air."	S_M0
"The professor ,however ,points out that unlike birds which used just the back limbs, pterosaurs used four limbs to push off the ground."	S_S2

"As far ad i am concerned, learning a foreign language is not only for travel and work in a foreign country, but also expend horizons from foreign culture by individuals."	S_T1
"There are more reasons to learn a foreign language."	S_T0
"Undoubtedly, one of the reason is that people learn a foreign language for their work and travel, which save money in the traveling time."	S_M1
"Because they do not need spend money to invite translator and tour guide to stay with them."	B_S0
"Especially they are simply to talk with foreign people, such as reserving rooms and asking scenic spots, etc."	I_S0
"Moreover, some workers employed in the international companies, and sometimes they solve problems very easy than others without to learn a foreign language, which could get promotion in the workplace."	E_S0
"However,there are more reasons that people should learn a foreign language."	S_M1
"Firstly,learning a foreign language makes people to expend their cultural horizons from other country or site,and they understand how to create different languages by different countries."	B_S0
"Secondly,exercising brain function and improving memory are advantages if people learn two different languages,which delay the appearance of diseases."	I_S0
"Finally,the researchers have been studied that bilingual children are smarter than monolingual children,which makes them to solve problems and imitate brain function easily in the future."	E_S0
"In my point of view,learning a foreign language is important way to people,which benefits in the daily life,while travel and work are one of the reason."	S_C2
"The diversity of language cannot ignored by people,and individuals learn a foreign language which is symbol of different cultural consciousness."	S_S2
 
"Nowadays, the number of students who are leaving schools with negative thoughts on studying is increasing."	S_T0
"As far as I am concerned, the main reason why students leave schllos is the lack of learning interest."	B_S0
"The first reason why students do not like studying is the school can not provide interesting lessons to students ."	I_S0
"Many courses in school is difficult and boring to students, like math , physics and chemistry."	I_S0
"These courses give students too much pressure,  because of its characters, increasingly students produce the mood of study- weariness."	I_S0
"Finally ,as a reasult of that a number of students leaving school ."	I_S0
"Secondly,the teachers in school have certain responsibility."	I_S0
"Teachets shuold  encourage students to study with happiness."	I_S0
"Thy must communicate with students and play funny games with them in spare time instead of enforce students to study in my view it dose not work at all ,it only make students hate studying and leave school with neagtive thougets."	I_S0
"The most important thing is themselve's inner thoughts."	I_S0
"Studying can be good to themsleve."	I_S0
"The more konwledge they learned in school the easier they can get a job in society."	I_S0
"The students still have to change thire mind, to find the pleasure about studying,instead of leaving school ."	I_S0
"It is a bad choice for youg students."	I_S0

"Some people advocate that people have to face various kinds of  in the modern society."	S_T1
"I partly agree with this point."	B_S0
"Since being bored,we start to choose diffirent kinds of toys,some boys prefer to play electronic toy cars,and other girls think that barbie doll is their loyal playmate,which decides to the foundamental characters of every person to some extent."	I_S0
"And after becoming a student,a problem that we must choose our major as the future occupations has to be addressed by ourselves,which has a direct impact on our job prospect."	I_S0
"In fact,with the developement of sociey, there are a large number of emerging industries appearing in daily life such as E-sports industry and research of new clean energy ,we have to give a correct evaluation for the future trend of these industries before making our choices."	I_S0
"From this perspective,we really have abundant options nowadays."	I_S0
"By contrast,we might not have sufficient options to choose as a result of limited knowledge."	I_S0
"As the rapid expansion of different industries,the demand of acquiring professional knowlegde also have an evident increase,which means only the top of talented people in all industries would have more options in their future."	I_S0
"On the contrary, the majority of normal people are less likely to have chances to decide their life."	I_S0
"Especially nowadays,the educational gap between the priority and the poor has been expanding for the unbalanced economic situations in different regions all around the world."	I_S0
"The person who was born in affluent family tends to have more chances to be educated in a well-known school,and also learn more knowlegde in his major than other people living in poor family."	I_S0
"Therefore,the major group of society maybe not embrace more choices in their life."	I_S0
"In conclusion,the number of choices is uncertain because of different individual situations."	E_S0
 
"With the development of modern electronic devices, majority of people prefer to communicate about a project in person rather than write an e-mail."	B_I0
"Someone debates that it is more polite, but for me, I hold the view that communicating by e-mail is crucial, especially taking time and efficiency into consideration."	E_I0
"Admittedly, it is polite to ask questions face to face, only in this way, classmates or colleagues may talk more and share ideas more freedom."	S_M0
"However, this is not a good way to communicate with each other."	B_S1
"With the development of modern electronic devices, numerous people began using these devices in their daily life."	E_S1
"First, writing e-mails can save lots of time."	S_M0
"Sometimes individuals are in different places, going the place where the people live in is a waste of time."	B_S0
"Also, when people meet each other, most of them spend half of time talking something that not link to the subject."	I_S0
"Writing an e-mail can avoid these."	I_S0
"Sending an e-mail just need few of minutes, more convenient than talking to others face to face."	I_S0
"For instance, Ju Hua is my friend, she likes asking questions after class, but it cost all her spare time to find teachers in offices."	I_S0
"When she found the teachers, the class would began."	I_S0
"She wasted all her time and do nothing."	I_S0
"Finally, she detected and began to send e-mails to her teachers, she wrote all the puzzle in the e-mail."	I_S0
"Teachers responded quickly and help her solve these questions."	E_S0
"Second, writing e-mails can be efficient."	S_M0
"When individuals writing their e-mails they can develop their ideas, which can make the e-mails organized."	B_S0
"So others can get the point of the e-mails more clearly."	I_S0
"For example, sometimes I have an idea, but I can’t mention it well, but if I write down it, I can make the idea more organized and others can get it easily."	E_S0
"In conclusion, I hold the view that communicate about a project in person will produce better work for the project."	S_C2

"Sweden also saw a decrease in the emmisions of carbon dioxiede."	B_S1
"It decreased considerablely from 8.8 in 1967 to nearly 5.5 in 2007, however, during which, it climbed from 8.8 to 10.2 between 1967 and 1977."	E_S1
"The emissions in Italy and Portugal were increased from 1967 to 2007."	S_M1
"Italy saw an  increase from about 4.2 to 7.6 during 1967 to 1997, after which, it had no change till 2007."	B_S1

"The graph below shows the increse in the ageing population in three countriesIt also describes the  proportion of the population aged 65 and over from 1940 the proportion of the population aged 65 and over from 1940 to 2040 in Japan, Sweden and USA."	S_I0
"According to the graph, the proportion of the Sweden’s population, which is the seniors aged 65 and over is upward from 7% to 26%."	S_M2
"Meanwhile,in the USA the proportion of the aged population is increase gradually between the time period of 1940 and 2014 (9% and 23% respectively)."	B_S0

"Nowadays, more and more people endeavor to do something for their communities."	B_I0
"Yet among them, hardly can we see young poeple do a favor."	E_I0
"Some people holds that young poeple don't have enough time to do it, while other disagree with this idea."	B_T0
"From my perspective, I agree with the former one."	E_T0
"First of all, young people have too much pressure from their work."	S_M0
"So they have no extra time to help their communities."	B_S0
"Take my own sister, Kate, as an example."	I_S0
"When she entered the job market at the age of 24, she just has 20 days per year for her to arrange freely."	I_S0
"She gets us early and stays up late for working until 11:00PM."	I_S0
"Even on weekend, she haves to crude on her small desk to finish her huge amount of tasks because she may be taken the place by other competitors if she doesn't work hard."	I_S0
"Actually, my sister is not a special case, there are hundreds of young people like her struggling their life."	I_S0
"So how can she have any time to make some contribution for her communities?"	E_S0
"As for those students, they also don't have enough time to do a favor to their communities such as doing some volunteer activities."	S_M0
"Parents always make full use of their weekends and even don't give their children time to 'breathe', because they hopes that their children can enter universities to accept further education."	B_S0
"So the young learners are forced to study everyday without wasting one second."	I_S0
"Thus, there is no doubt that they are not been given enough time for helping others."	E_S0
"What's more, lots of other entertainment attract the young attention."	S_M0
"In the past, the only relaxing thing for young people is sport because electronic products are not popular at all."	B_S0
"So in the rest of their free time, they usually try their best to help their communities, say, building house by themselves for the old to dance and chat."	I_S0
"However, with the development of hi-tech products, young people pay more attention on the Internet."	I_S0
"In my case, I can even browse websites from morining to night withour caring about anything else."	I_S0
"Therefore, we are really have no time to help communities."	E_S0
"With reference to the argument above, I firmly think young people leave little time to assist their communities."	S_C2
 
"I disagree with this view."	S_T1
"As everyone know, our society is improving and the information transportation ways are more and more."	B_T0
"The information can be easier transformed than past times."	I_T0
"However, as the use of the computer more and more universal, many computer games are apeared on computer and many children like playing them."	E_T0
"And palying games always cost much time."	B_S0
"Though it  difficulte to limit the desire of children playing games, there are also some benefit that educating children in nowadays."	I_S0
"Let me list three reasons."	E_S0
"First,I have to say that it is really difficult to limitb the desire of  our childre to play games,though this games had took too much time from their study time."	S_M1
"Because computer games have many ways to make childs fun."	B_S0
"For boys,there are many FPS shooting games and Moba games which are very stimulus and funny."	I_S0
"For girls, there are many dresing games which can make their favorate clohes."	I_S0
"These games always control the desire of the students, and this impact the education of the children."	E_S0
"However,computers and cell phones are not good for nothing."	S_M1
"Because nowadays the information can be transformed in a very fast way, childres can get many knowledges than past times."	B_S1
"They can learn surviing skills on the internet, they can know many conmunicating skills by working on socirty conmnicating apps, and they can also learn many professional knowledges in a quick and easy way,just to put a button."	E_S1
"So,"	S_S2
 
"In my opinion,it is right and proper for the peopole in senior management positions to get higher salaries."	S_T1
"Put yourselves in the bosses' shoes,from what you decide how much you pay you employees?"	B_S0
"It's dependent on what a employee could do for the company and how much profits could he earn."	I_S0
"A company's development depends on the hard work of the normal workers,but the most important thing is,including making decisions  about the ways of development for the company,leading their team to achieve the goal,is the managers'work."	I_S0
"In that way,it's not strange that senior leaders are more capable of taking responsbilities and make more contributions for the company."	I_S0
"Maybe you object that in a complete company, ordinary workers are as important as the managers."	I_S0
"But does a person with capacity of management as easy to develop and find as a ordinary worker?"	I_S0
"There's no denying that a qualified manager needs more experiences and much higher ablility than a worker."	I_S0
"Therefore,the people in the management deserved higher salaries."	E_S0
 
"It is true that cities are seeing a rise in smaller families and one-person households, while the extended family is becoming a rarity."	S_I0
"In my opinion, this is a negative development."	S_T0
"As families become smaller, the traditional family support network is disappearing, and this can have a negative impact on children as they grow up."	S_M1
"In a nuclear family or single-parent household, childcare becomes an expensive and stressful part of daily life."	B_S0
"Without the help of grandparents or aunts and uncles, busy parents must rely on babysitters, nannies and after-school clubs to take care of younger children, while older children may be left alone after school and during holidays."	I_S0
"The absence of adult family members can mean that friends, television and the Internet become the primary influences on children’s behavior."	I_S0
"It is no surprise that the decline of the extended family has been linked to a rise in psychological and behavioral problems among young people."	E_S0
"The trend towards people living alone is perhaps even more damaging because of the psychological effects of reduced human interaction."	S_M1
"Individuals who live on their own have nobody to talk to in person, so they cannot share problems or discuss the highs and lows of daily life."	B_S0
"They forgo the constant stimulation and hustle and bustle of a large family, and are left to their own devices for extended periods of time."	I_S0
"The lack of human contact in the home is necessarily replaced by passive distractions, such as television, video games, online chat rooms or Internet surfing."	I_S0
"This type of existence is associated with boredom, loneliness, and feelings of isolation or even alienation, all of which are factors that are known to increase the risk of mental illness."	E_S0
"In conclusion, I believe that individuals thrive when they are part of larger family groups, and so it is worrying that many people are choosing to live alone or in such small family units."	S_C2
 
"Thanks to social and economic development, it is quite common these day to learn a second language."	S_T1
"Some people believe that  the only reason for this is to prepare for working or traveling overseas while a counter agreement supports that only this is too simple to explain such phenomenon."	B_S0
"Personally, i think there are still some other causes of this."	I_S0
"Some people think that traveling or working to another country can be the only reason of learning a foreign language."	I_S0
"Nowadays, with the increasingly popularity to go abroad to find a job due to the fact the the salary might be higher in some developed areas, workers may study a second langhuage to reach the requirment."	I_S0
"Besides, as the tourial industy is becoming more and more developed, many poeple may hope to find a opportunity to travel abroad and communicate with people from different nations to experience the exotic culture, therefore, they will choose to learn a second language."	I_S0
"However, it is far from enough to explain this situation, learning a foreign language may also have another reasons."	I_S0
"First, it is no doubt that due to the rapid economic development, many families can offer children to study overseas."	I_S0
"As a result, student will learn a second  language to enter their future university and better get used to local life."	I_S0
"This kind of people constitute the largest proportion of learning population."	I_S0
"Second, with the launch of globalisation, many multinational companies might come to invest in demestic place."	I_S0
"To have a higher qualification and master a different skill, people themselves will be valuable to have more job opportunities and get a better career prospects."	I_S0
"To sum up, working and traveling dose explain why people start to learn a second language, but there still some other more major  reasons to this phenomenon, for instance, plan to learn abroad or to be more skiied to increase their job opportunity."	E_S0
 
"The graph illustrates the percentage of the  households in owned and rented accomodation over 93 in England and Wales."	S_I0
"As the whole,the proportion of rented accomodation is a lot more than owned accomodation."	B_T1
"But obviously,they were the same in 1971 and stayed in 50%."	E_T1
"In addition,the percentage of owned showed the similar upward trend from 1918 to 1971,starting from 23% and stabling at 50%."	B_S0
"After that,owned started to decline between 1971 and 2001."	I_S0
"In 2011,the data slightly recovery."	E_S0
"In 1918,the peak of rented accomodation reach approximately 80."	S_M2
"Besides,except for 1961 to 1981 the proportion nothing has changed basically."	B_S0
"To sum up,the trends of the households accomodation in England and Wales is similar."	I_S0
"Also,the proportion of rented took up most."	E_S0

"In winter,the number of typical daily demand for electricity are 35,000 units at 0 o'clock and the figure for that increases to 40,000 units at 3 o'clock."	S_M0
"After that,there is a decline from 40,000 units to 30,000 units between 3 and 7 o'clock."	B_S0
"Then,the figure for that increases continuously and reaches the peak at 45,000 units at 21 o'clock and decreased to 35,000 units at 24 o'clock."	I_S0
"The figure for typical daily demand for electricity shows a different pattern in summer which decreases slightly from 17,000 units to 13,000 units from 0 o'clock to 9 o'clock and then rises to 20,000 units at 13 o'clock."	I_S0
"Despite a slight decline,it remains at about 16,000 units and increases to 20,000 units, then decreases to 17,000 units at 24 o'clock."	E_S0
"There are 52.5% electricity which are used for heating rooms and water and 17.5% electricity are used for ovens,kettles,washing machines."	S_M0
"The number of electricity which is used for lighting TV,radio and vacuum cleaners,food mixers,electric tools are the same at 15%."	S_S2
"Overall,In winter,the time during typical days of largest demand for electricity is about 22 o'clock while the time of that in summer is 13 o'clock."	S_M0
"Most electricity is used for heating rooms and heating water."	S_S2
 
"Nowadays, public health has been treated as one of the most sophisticated problems in each society."	S_T1
"While some people say that the best way to improve public health is by increasing the numbers of sports facilities, eg, gym and so on."	B_S0
"Others, however, say that this would have little effect on public health and that other measures are required."	I_S0
"This essay will cover both of the mentioned views and then will suggest one of the best strategies to improve public health."	I_S0
"Availability of the sports facilities can make a situation that anyone in any place can do exercise and undeniably, it does affect some parameters of public health in a society."	I_S0
"Discuss in another way, these days people can easily find exercise facilities near their houses and they don' t need to waste time and cost of going to some specific areas to do exercise."	I_S0
"By contrast, over last years, people should spend time for the mentioned purpose and most of the times they don't attend to do exercise as they find it difficult because of the shortage of sports facilities."	I_S0
"However, making sports facilities in each street or residential areas can only have a bit effect on public health, this cannot encourage people to do exercise lonely."	I_S0
"Hence, public awareness about the role of exercising in health would be considered besides the extending facilities for exercise."	I_S0
"For example, the media should concern more about public health and broadcast some suitable programs to show the importance of exercising on physical and mind health."	I_S0
"Also, there should be held several assemblies in community and health centres to invite people to go to the gyms by talking about the benefits."	I_S0
"I think, therefore, if people know that exercising is such a long-term investment as they don't need to pay for serious diseases in older ages, they would be interested in using sports facilities; however, enough sports facilities should be constructed in each part of cities and small communities."	E_S0

"I think the main cause of the phenomenon is that many students don't have a specific aim."	S_T1
"They don't exactly know what they will do in the future so they can't realize the significance of studying."	B_S0
"Take me for example,I was also wondering why I should stay at school and study in high school."	I_S0
"Those subjects were so difficult and abstract that I can't hardly hold on."	I_S0

"They are came here for work, at the begining they are not for fun."	B_S0
"And they are not expect to collect more experience."	I_S0
"The reason for why they came to work is they need money."	I_S0
"If they have same tasks every day, they will not need to spend a lot of them patient or emotions."	I_S0
"If they have diffirent types of tasks to do during the worday, they will need spend more times to think about how to fix it."	I_S0
"To compare with spend a little time to earn the same money or spend a lot of time to earn the same money, obviously the first one is better."	E_S0
"Secondly, by doing similar tasks all day long you can develop your skills in this area."	S_M1
"For instance, I have been played piano for 10 years."	B_S0
"And now I can play the music beautifully, and compare to the past."	I_S0
"At the beginning, I think it is difficult to pay one short song, but after I practice it a lot I have my own way to pay music perfectly."	I_S0
"During you do the same tasks, you can grow during you finish it all the time."	I_S0
"You also may have a conclusion about how can you do better next time."	I_S0
"It is a good way to study deeper in area, and it is  also easy to raise your company's status at the same time."	E_S0
"In conclusion, when workers doing same tasks it will help them relax and imprving their skills."	S_C2
 
"I agree with the opinion that the option of celebreties,such as entertainers and athletes,are more important to younger people than they are to old people."	S_T0
"First,younger peoples altitude needs play."	S_M0
"Sometimes some younger people have lucky situations like won the lottery,get good grades on the test,going to go to study at university."	B_S0
"These can be really happy to the younger people even to their family."	I_S0
"If ther's no celebrities,the life can be really boring."	I_S0
"It could be have bad influence on the younger people."	E_S0
"Second,some famous entertainers and athletes have their own celebrations."	S_M0
"Like Olympic Games."	B_S0
"They have a celebreation of gold,silver and brass metal."	I_S0
"Our China International Sports Team has won several Olympic Games metal."	I_S0
"Through 2008~2017,several Olympic Games like Seoul 1988,Beijing 2008,London 2012,Sochi 2014,Rio 2016,we, our Chines athletes has won lots of honor in sports."	I_S0
"We Chinese citizens are very proud of it,even  2008 Beijing Olympic Games,it's our first time that we held Olympic Games in China."	I_S0
"In 2022,Beijing will held Winter Olympic Games."	I_S0
"Also these athletes are younger people."	E_S0
"Third,some very big Science and Technology activity is also could be celebrated."	S_M0
"These young worklers spends day and night to sacrice his time on research of science and technology,Especially on space."	B_S0
"There are many new young workers in CASC(China Aircraft and Space Company)."	I_S0
"They are good generation of space include 10 astronauts."	I_S0
"Back to Oct 13th,2003,our China has first launch the spaceship Shenzhou-5(SZ-5)and Astronaut Yang Liwei."	I_S0

"In my opinion, in 20 years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today."	B_T1
"there are several reason why I think the cars will be fewer, the new transportation mothods, more convenient public transportation and the higher car cost."	E_T1
"Firstly, there wii be some new transportation in 20 years."	S_M0
"As we know, with the development of the technology, more and more inventions have been created."	B_S0
"now days,so many cars  cause a lot of polution wich is harmful to our environment and themumerous cars beyond the capacity of city transportaion system."	I_S0
"Therefore,  those face will boost people  come up with a new transportation mothods to replace the car."	I_S0
"For example, some inventor will cread a kind of plane which use theelectronic power fly through the city."	I_S0
"this kind of new transpotation is good for the environment and make the transport more smoothly, so they will replace the car very soon."	E_S0
"Second, government maybe will build more conveient public transportation to the citizen. a amout of cars will make road and strees very busy which will cause citizen take a lot of time on shift from one places to another place."	S_M0
"it will reduce the efficiency."	B_S0
"Public transprotation can solve this problem."	I_S0
"For example ,in the subway, no matter how many peope there, subway can arrive to one station from other station on time, it would ont effect by other issues."	E_S0
"Finally, the fuel cost is higher and higher and the fix fee for the car is more and more expensive."	S_M0
"Many people can not afford the cost for car that cause  it is not necessary to own a car."	B_S0
"the higher cost to own a car push peopleto choose other mohods for transprotation."	I_S0
"For example, the car cost become higher, many citizen dicide to ride a bicycle  to go to work,rater"	E_S0
"In conclusion, in 20 years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today."	B_C1
"there are several reason why I think the cars will be fewer, the new transportation mothods, more convenient public transportation and the higher fuel cost."	E_C1
 
"Nowadays，more and more decided to learn a second language even the third one ."	S_T1
"Someone believe that studying or working abroad are the only reason why they choose to learn foreigen language ,but others disagree with that ."	B_S0
"In my opion ,i agree with the latter ."	I_S0
"Firstly,it is true that ,after education, there are not many opportunities to use foreign language in the normal daily life,time goes by,they just forget what they learnt."	I_S0
"And for nowadys students the major target for study foreign language is to communicate with the foreigner even study abroad ."	I_S0
"In addtion,people always see mastering a foreign language as a basic skill to study or live in the foreign countries ."	I_S0
"However, learning a foreign has other benefits."	I_S0
"learning a forigrn language can help puplic easier to accept foreign culture."	I_S0
"For example,as the development of the telecommunication and internet ,it gives us  oppotunities feeling the foreign culture without going abroad."	I_S0
"If we master their language ,it will be much helpful to understand the backgrand information and learn new things."	I_S0
"Inaddtionaly,the foerign language always has totaly different gagrammar."	I_S0

"Some countries has alreadly got rid of the the agriculture problems while there are still many people experiencing huger in the world."	B_S0
"In my perspective, it boils down to various reasons."	I_S0
"As we all know tha economy development plays a singnificant role in agriculture production."	I_S0
"However, in some poor countries like Africa and Venian, they don't have the access to the advance technology actually due to their limited budget."	I_S0
"Then waht can do is manufacturing their rices and vegetables in a very primitive way."	I_S0
"Besides, it is well known to us that the population in the world increase dramatically especially in some developping countries."	I_S0
"It is hard to satisfy the high demand of food from the rising population even if the improvements are made in the agriculture area."	I_S0
"Additionally, limited land resource and import and export tax also account a lot to these problem."	I_S0
"So in order to solve these problem, it is vital for the world organazation to promote a sense of give-and-gain among all the countries."	I_S0
"China has established a prominent example in this way like helping some African countries to build some basic agriculture facilities over the recent years."	I_S0
"What's more, it will also means a lot if the number of the people in the world can be well controled."	I_S0

"Nevertheless I cannot disagree with this statement more."	S_T0
"As for as I'm concern, it is crucial for children to learn how to manage their money, though maybe only small amount of, in order to be a finacially responsible adult."	S_T1
"First, learning to manage money makes a child know how precious the money is."	S_M0
"Therefore, they won't exploit their money on things of no use."	B_S0
"Then one day, my mother gives me 100 yuan and told me that this was all the money available in this month."	I_S0
"I reluctantly managed my money and felt that it was really hard to getenough money."	I_S0
"Therefore I never waste money any longer as I grow up."	E_S0
"Second, learnng to manage money teaches children how to increase their fortune."	S_M0
"As I have said in the last statement, money is precious and it is hard to increase our budget and put our money into things that can increase our fortune - for instance, a child may use part of his pocket money to buy some cards and sell the cards to his friends to gain some extra money."	B_S1
"Children who are familiar with how to increase their fortune by managind their money are more likely to gain finacial success in the future."	E_S1
"Third, learning how to manage money can also help children to manage other aspects of their daily life."	S_M0
"As a child is used to managing other aspects in life, such as time."	B_S0

"Generally speaking,when Japan first started,the population labor was rising countinuously,while the US was declining until 5.0."	E_S0
 
"I agree with the idea that community activities should be mandatory for high school students"	O
"Community activities can cultivate students' sense of responsibility, so that they can be better out of society."	S_M2
"If community activities are not mandatory, some children may not take the initiative to participate, which is not good for their growth."	B_S0
"And participating in community activities allows them to work hard to appreciate their parents' hardship."	I_S0
"And they can make more friends in community activities, exercise their leadership and organizational skills, and improve their life skills."	E_S0
 
"In the modren society, hleping to each other is familiar thing."	S_I0
"People clerly know that it is very hard for them to live in urban."	S_T1

"However, there are two conditions, one person who is your friend have any ambition and another one is the struggling stranger."	I_S0
"People would be more willing to help the strangers but struggling."	E_S0
"Firstly, in most of people's view, they think quality is more important for one."	S_M2
"Indeed, a struggling persom has grater probability of success, even though now he seems to very poor of money or status."	B_S1
"but who can accurate predict the future about a struggling person."	E_S1
 
"Environmental problems haunt our lives."	B_I0
"It is said that the loss and extinction of many animal and plant species is more important than any other problem."	I_I0
"But some people disagree."	I_I0
"I will discuss these points and express my point of view."	I_I0
"This is what I agree with."	E_I0
"On the one hand, the biodiversity of the creatures on our planet is crucial to the continued survival of humanity."	S_M1
"The various ecosystems in their respective biomes are natural sources of food and resources."	B_S0
"Animals and plants have irreplaceable links in the food chain."	I_S0
"Therefore, it is understandable that some people think that the protection of animal and plant species has the highest importance in dealing with environmental issues."	E_S0
"On the other hand, some people think that other environmental problems are more important than the destruction of life systems on earth."	S_M1
"Other environmental issues do have a negative impact on our planet."	B_S0
"For example, industrial pollution and deforestation have severely damaged global ecosystems."	I_S0
"If the habitats of animals and plants are completely destroyed, they cannot be saved."	I_S0
"There is no doubt that this is a crucial issue."	I_S0
"For these reasons, I think other environmental issues should be resolved before trying to protect certain animal and plant species."	E_S0
"All in all, although the protection of certain animals and plants is undoubtedly beneficial, I think this is not the most important environmental activity."	B_C1
"I think that if the human destruction problems such as pollution and deforestation are solved first, the environment will be better protected because it will eliminate the need to protect animal and plant species."	E_C1
 
"With the process of globalization, an increasing number of people make their choice to travel or work aboard, which arouses a controversy over the reasons and advantages why people learn foreign languages nowadays."	S_T1
"The following essay will discuss this issue and try to make a conclusion."	B_S0
"Admittedly, it is reasonable to learn a foreign language just for travel and work aboard."	I_S0
"As oral communication and handwriting is always of vital importance in socialization, a foreign language will be necessarily helpful in daily life."	I_S0
"To be more specific, being well-equiped with a foreign language can enable people who live or travel aboard to establish the social network without any restriction of language barrier, consequently improving one's life quality."	I_S0
"A typical example is that only when you have the capacity to express your opinion in a precise and brief way can the employers belief that you are trustworthy enough and assign crucial tasks to you."	I_S0
"And this requires a basic language skill."	I_S0
"However, considering that nowaways, globalization has already became an international tredency, the merits of learing a foreign language are no longer limitied in this certain area."	I_S0
"One thing that should not be ignored is the increasing number of multinational businesses, which makes the language skills gradually become an indispensabel ability for an interdisciplinary talent."	I_S0
"In other words, even working in a domestic company needs the employees to know how to communicate with others in a foreign language."	I_S0
"Without this competitive edge, people might find themselves in a passive position in the talent market."	I_S0
"Other than that, mastering a foreigh language also means that a high-school or university student will have the chance to study aboard in the future, which provides them a different choice for their further development."	I_S0
"Having taken all the opnions above into consideration, I personally hold the view that the reasons for studying foreigh languages are various nowadays, especially for people who live in such a multicutural society."	I_S0
"It can make contributions not only for those who are interested in foreign travel and work, it is also a blessing for the people who study and work in their own country."	E_S0
 
"As there are many students leaving school with negative thoughts on studying, I come up with 3 main causes of the phenomenon."	S_T0
"First of all, as time goes by, people find that, study isn't the only way to success anymore."	B_S0
"Recent years, internet celebrities play a more and more important role in our daly life."	I_S0
"They have millions of fans, they earn a lot of money over one night."	I_S0
"They don't need to be well educated."	I_S0
"But they need to have speciality."	I_S0
"Some people find a new way to success, so they abandon the traditional way."	I_S0
"Another reason is one child policy."	I_S0
"Because every families are allowed to have only one child, the children are the prince or princess of the family."	I_S0
"There are no many obstacles in their life."	I_S0
"Studying is difficult, and the difficulties scare them."	I_S0
"As a reasult, they give up on it."	I_S0
"The last reason is that in China our kids suffer from studying."	I_S0
"In primary school, we learn the courses of foreign high school."	I_S0
"In their childhood, they can't have much fun with their friends, because they have too much homework to do."	I_S0
"They also should take classes outside school, because they need to be adimiited into a key middle school or high school."	I_S0
"But all of these efforts come to the colleage entrance examnation."	I_S0
"If you are forced to do something you don't like for a long time, you will fight fiercely one day."	I_S0
"For the improvement, I think we should stop forcing them to learn the things they don't like."	I_S0
"Then, we should find out their specilities and advantages."	I_S0
"Not everyone can be a mathmatician or a physicist."	I_S0
"And last year, it's allowed to have 2 children in China."	I_S0
"Parents shouldn't spoil their kids, they should teach them to face the difficulties in their own life."	E_S0
 
"The graph below shows the consumption of fish and some different kinds of meat in a European country between 1979 and 2004."	S_I0
"Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant."	S_M0
"The graph illustrates changes in the amounts of beef, lamb, chicken and fish consumed in a particular European country between 1979 and 2004."	B_S0
"In 1979, beef was by far the most popular of these foods, with about 225 grams consumed per person per week."	I_S0
"Lamb and chicken were eaten in similar quantities (around 150 grams), while much less fish was consumed (just over 50 grams)."	E_S0
"However, during this 25-year period the consumption of beef and lamb fell dramatically to approximately 100 grams and 55 grams respectively."	S_M0
"The consumption of fish also declined, but much less significantly to just below 50 grams, so although it remained the least popular food, consumption levels were the most stable."	S_S2
"The consumption of chicken, on the other hand, showed an upward trend, overtaking that of lamb in 1980 and that of beef in 1989."	S_M0
"By 2004 it had soared to almost 250 grams per person per week."	S_S2
"Overall, the graph shows how the consumption of chicken increased dramatically while the popularity of these other foods decreased over the period."	S_C2
 
"Some people in society think that people think that is a good idea."	S_I0
"However, I have a different idea."	B_T1
"When it comes to statement that i think that is not a good idea, I strongly agree."	I_T1
"There are some reasons why I feel this way: thansfer the purpose of learning and antipathy to learning."	E_T1
"First of all, If children study for a certain dress, he becomes different of purpose for study."	S_M2
"It may be effective in a short time to improve their grade, but once you get it, children will be"	O
 
"Have you ever draw in the computer by using many fantastic functions?"	B_I0
"Have you been spirited by a model of the future airplane in the technology museum?"	I_I0
"The answer must be Yes."	I_I0
"My sister and me always draw by using computer and we can built three-dimention pictures."	I_I0
"And once we have seen a plane model in the technology museum."	I_I0
"We are attracted by it and built our own model when we went back home."	E_I0
"Therby, I think technology help children to be more creative than before."	S_T0
"There are two more specific reasons why I think in this way."	S_S2
"Initially, I think the advanced function such as three-dimention can help us create more cubic objects that is difficult for us to draw by hands."	S_M1
"For instance, my sister and I use the three-dimention function in computer; we draw a flower in different facets and color it with thousands of colors to make it more realistic."	B_S0
"We try every funtion to built and color the diverse flowers that we create."	I_S0
"Many weeks later, our parents think that our pictures become more and more realistic and extraordinary."	I_S0
"However, in the past, we can just drew pictures on the paper and create the characters in one facet and color it with twenty four colors."	I_S0
"It seems not novel or beautiful."	E_S0
"Moreover, I think the cutting-edge models in technology museum can provide more details that  spirite us to built our own entique model."	S_M1
"For example, after watched the advaced airplane model on the green."	B_S0
"We went back and imagined our own planes."	I_S0
"We make the arms of the palne birds-like and add the mouth on it."	I_S0
"Though the plane is not practical, but we have meditate and add own ideas."	I_S0
"That technological model make us more creative."	E_S0
"Even though the technological machine such as computer do make many people dulged in playing games and make them awakward, I still think if parents make schedules for their children and control them more, we can avoide that situation."	B_C1
"Taking account of all the factors mentioned above, we may safely arrive the conclusion that technology can make children more creative."	E_C1
 
"Are you addicted to using techinology at present?"	B_I0
"Compared with the past, which kind of life do you like?"	I_I0
"From my perpective, techonology, including smart phone, computer, kindle and so on, really stifles children's creativity by occupying all their time and no spare time for them to enjoy the natural environment, which is the best place to create some new ideas."	E_I0
"Before the advent of techonological era, children are more likely to play on the grass and some other outside places, which make them more curious about the world and think deeply about what they see."	S_M2
"Newton is the best example to illustrate this statement."	B_S0
"As a little boy, he liked to play under the tree andpiant lonely."	I_S0
"Once fortunately, an apple dropped down just on his head, which made him think about why an apple will suddenly fall without some power and how to explain this phenomenon."	I_S0
"Hence, the theory of Earth gravitation had been brought out by Newton, which cause immensely influence on the area of physics until  today."	I_S0
"If Newton is present is today's society, he may stay at home to explore his technology products rather than play outside, the theory will not be found in such early time."	I_S0
"Thus, technology will make children become preoccupied with the games, simple and do not need to think in their mind, in the smartphones."	I_S0
"More seriously, more technology even make children more dependent on the advanced function but never try to create by themselves."	E_S0
"In nowadays, children are creative really, but they are less creative than the children in the past."	B_C0
"To take myself, a little gril, as an example."	I_C0
"All of my time is filled with video games, tv show and opera programma, which is funny and I always think to make some new games in the future so that I can play my own game all day lone and do not need to pay some money."	I_C0
"I indeed want to create some games, but my purpose is just to let myself play games cheaper and easily, which will not contribute to our society's development."	E_C0
"Thus, the creative minds in nowadays are more complex and benifit-oriented, but in the past is opposite."	S_S2
 
"Nowadays, schools in various countries witness that students have many behavioural problems."	S_I0
"Unfortunately, this will make it harder for schools to educate students as problematic behaviours are likely to interfere with the education process."	S_T1
"There are some reasons accounting why students behave inappropriately."	S_M1
"Many of the children have become overreacted or showing negative behavior in class."	B_S0
"The negative attitude of the children is mainly due to the lack of attention of their parents."	I_S0
"They would only have a limited time for their children."	I_S0
"As a result, some children have acted negatively to get the attention of their parents."	I_S0
"Furthermore, it is undeniable that video games are affecting the mindset of the children nowadays."	I_S0
"A lot of children are behaving aggressively because of the games which shows a lot of violence."	I_S0
"Consequently, several children think that fighting or teasing their friends is a normal activity."	E_S0
"In order to counter such problem, teachers should be friendly while still maintaining their positions and principles."	S_M1
"In this way, teachers might be able to understand students' views and come up with proper ways to treat them."	B_S0
"In addition, it is also important to connect with students patiently."	I_S0
"It is wise to be patient and guide students gradually to be well-behaved rather than using force to do so."	E_S0
"In conclusion, behavioural problems result from the way society works these days and external parties, such as bad influences from TV shows."	B_C1
"However, by understanding students’ views and guiding them patiently, students can gradually change and behave in a more appropriate manner."	E_C1
 
"The improved medical care in the modern society leads to longer life expectancy, but could longer life also bring more happiness?"	S_I0
"It is difficult to determine."	S_T0
"Longer lives are only worthwhile when people can spend it independently, meaningfully and happily."	S_T1
"A major advantage of longer lives lies in the happiness of achieving a basic human need."	S_M1
"When life expectancy increases, people naturally feel happy , because they have more time to explore the world and do what they like."	B_S1
"Such happiness may bring benefits to the society, because people have more time to study, and more time to try ,which may leads to improvements in  advance of productivity efficiency."	E_S1
"However, the disadvantages of such development should not be neglected."	S_M1
"On one hand, the life is lengthened, but its quality doesn't improve for sure, particularly in elder age groups."	B_S0
"Elder people suffer from a considerable range of chronic disease most of which are hard to cure ."	I_S0
"These illnesses can't kill you immediately ,but generally troubling and lasting, also unfortunately painful."	I_S0
"What's worse, some of the illnesses may take elders' memory and independence."	I_S0
"On the other hand, longer lives means an aging society, which may cause a series of problems relating to the world's economy and resources."	I_S0
"This problem is very serious in many developed countries like UK and Japan, where elder people possess a large proportion of the population."	E_S0
"In conclusion, both sides have their points and it would be difficult to define the outcome as either beneficial or harmful."	B_C1
"Therefore, the government should establish organizations to tackle these upcoming problems, in addition to the further improvement in medical care."	E_C1
 
"Nowadays the competive in job market is get more and more serious."	S_T1
"In China,a lot of university students couldn't get job after their graduations,more and more students have to stay home and wait for employment opportunity,the students who can't find job are ascribed to the knowledge they have studied in schools is useless,it couldn't give a way to the job they want."	B_S0
"I think that's why many young students are leaving schools with negative thoughts on studying."	I_S0
"To overcome the problem,on the one hand our goverment should creat more employment oppotunities in job market."	I_S0
"Tertiary industry play a important role in the economy,it could creat more jobs,so goverment have to improve the scientific and technological level to change the persents of industry,reduce the primary industry and secondary industry."	I_S0
"In the other hand,we should adjust the education."	I_S0
"Traditional education always teach students knowledge but it hardly ever practice the knowledge in realitySo,theories and practiced to combine togetherto sttir up raw recruit more to students,they also adopt a positive attitude to stimulate the potential of the actual study,work,schools have to use."

"Many are concered about how to apply a correct teaching modes among teachers and there is a particular concern that whether teachers ask students to finish assignments together or just one student accomplish by himself."	B_T1
"From my standpoint, I consider that colarborative group could benifit students better becasue of several reasons."	E_T1
"First of all, the student in your team could help you to figure out the problem which is hard to you."	S_M0
"For instance, I major in Computer Science and once teacher asked us, formed a 4 student group, to bulid a program by language C. I am good at write language codes, however I nearly can't build up the framework, which is the basic step for a program."	B_S0
"If I were along, this homework would be impossible for me to accomplish."	I_S0
"But a friend of mine taought me how to work out this problem and he entirely instructed me how to apply by hands to hands."	I_S0
"Because of the group work, I really benifited a lot and that made sence."	E_S0
"On the other hand, group work means more effective because each student of the group can finish one part of the assignment , then combines all parts together."	S_M0
"Imaige one person finish a work cost 8 hours per day and last about fortenight."	B_S0
"What about another person join in the work."	I_S0
"These two guys, also work 8 hours per day, only need one week to finish the assignment."	I_S0
"In additional, one add to one sometimes even equal to 3 and 4, that is the function of colarborative work."	E_S0
"In conversely, people who work alone may lose their passion, they feel more and more bored and have no aspiration to work out a diffcult problem."	S_M0
"Accordingly to a recent study, If someone else has a competition to you, you will feel more confident and all things you want to do is beat him."	B_S1
"Therefore in a group projects, some students are better than you, you aspire to beat them  and work hard to gain more knowledge."	E_S1

"In addition,there is also fair judgment in criminal incidents."	E_I0
"If fixed legal provisions can be used to restrict people ’s behavior and punish criminal behavior, there will be less arguments in criminal cases."	S_T0
"Fixed punishments are necessary,however,the rules and regulations  should provide certain limits to give different events some flexibility that can adjust the severity of the sentence to make the different events more fair."	S_M2
"In the debate of the dilemma of some psychologists, the flexibility of the law is often mentioned."	B_S0

"The article doubts the view that bees exist on Earth as early as 200 million years ago."	S_T1
"However, the speaker disagree with those reasons."	B_S0
"Firstly, the fact that there lack fossils of bees dating back to 200 million years ago cannot lead to the view that there is no bee during that time."	I_S0
"For it might be the case that those fossils couldn't be preserved because they need a certain sticky liquid produced by trees, which might be rare during that time."	I_S0
"Secondly, despite absence of flowering plants, there still exist a possibility that bees appear at that time because they might feed on none flower plants."	I_S0
"So it is okay that without the presence of flowering plants, bees can still stay alive."	I_S0
"The feeding behavior of feeding on flowering plants might be a later revolution."	I_S0
"Thirdly, lack of detail on structures may cause some doubts, but we can still solve them by giving out the chemical evidence."	I_S0
"By analyzing the chemical components of the structure, we can find a great number of similarities to the modern bees, which suggest that bees do exist during that time."	I_S0

"It is education that parents pay more attention to with the development of the society."	B_I0
"There are some parents tend to offer their children some money for each high grade they get in school."	I_I0

"Fisrt of all, getting money which parents offer children for high grade provide students with a great oppotunity to buy something they will use in study."	S_M1
"Furthermore, children would like to learn some financial management skills in the practice rather than only learn it at the class."	B_S0
"For example, when I was 9, I got the best grade in my class."	I_S0
"And my parents would like to award me for the good performance."	I_S0

"TV Channels"	S_S0
"In the nowadyas society, the technology in any kind of media is growing rapidly."	S_T1
"More and more people try to design varied kind of TV channels for peopel to entertain or gaining information."	B_S0
"However, there are always to sides of everything."	I_S0
"Initially, creating more TV channels can give people more choices about what they want to see."	I_S0
"People in the world are so different, more specifically, everyone is different."	I_S0
"They might have different taste in TV shows."	I_S0
"Therefore, the larger amount of the TV shows, the larger range of the audience."	I_S0
"In this case, it can make sure that more people in the world can actually enjoy a TV show that they truly like."	I_S0
"On the other hand, creating more TV channels mean that is is harder for the producer to focus on the show."	I_S0
"The number of the director is limited, which means that if more channel is happening, less attention every show will get."	I_S0
"If the director isn't focusing on what they are produing, the quality will not reach the epectation."	I_S0
"It is not hard to observe the real world experience."	I_S0
"However, something more serious is that when they are already a lot of channels have been made, the idea will eventrually get old."	I_S0
"Some producer just stick with the old idea about creating shows which is less surprising anymore."	I_S0
"The aurdience will not feel amazed when thery see the new show coming up which is a tragety."	I_S0
"From my point of view, i agree with the second idea."	I_S0
"The amount won't be the problem, the problem is about the quality."	I_S0
"Less channel can let producer put the heart into the channel that they are creating."	I_S0
"They will put more effort in desiging the show."	I_S0
"In this case, people are able to see you care about it because they can see it when the channel is on."	I_S0
"In conclusion, i believe that the more isn't always going to be the best."	I_S0
"Less TV channels can provide people with a higher quality and newer ideas for the show."	E_S0

"Otherwise, students need to go to school every day, and employees need to travel and work frequently."	E_S0
"Working and studying at home can also bring people more possibility to achieve work and family balance."	S_M1
"The office-based work requires employees to spend a long time in their companies and makes it difficult to pay enough attention to their family issues, leading to a low work satisfaction and even a higher turnover of staff."	B_S1
"This is especially true for the female employees, who have to work arduously for their jobs on the one hand, and have to work around families on the other hand."	E_S1
"To conclude,teleworking and study from home free people and is beneficial to family-work balance."	S_C2
 
"I this is a not a good idea."	S_T1
"A student study in school and do homework everyday."	B_S0
"So they should get good grades."	I_S0
"Parents just should pay the cost of study."	I_S0
"If a student get good grates,parents can encourage him or he."	I_S0
"But if the parents give the money to this students,he or she may will get some bad habits or ideas such as:spend money freely."	I_S0
"Sometimes they may ask parents for more and more money."	I_S0
"If their parents refuse their idea,they may do some terrible things such as steal money from parents,classmates or someone else."	I_S0
"And a student should to remember then are studing for themselves not for their parents or money."	I_S0
"If a student get good grades their parents can take them out for a trip or buy a little gift for him or her but not money to a student."	E_S0

"In my opinion, the latter view is more realiable than the firest view."	I_S0
"Many people have the firet view because thay want to make money."	I_S0
"For example, people work in the foreign country."	I_S0
"Their boss give them some work to do."	I_S0
"Howere, they can not understand the message."	I_S0
"Therefor, they can not finish the tast."	I_S0
"As the result, they will be puished by their boss and may be lose their work."	I_S0
"So, they have to learn foreign language in order to income."	I_S0
"They also have not time to do else things, so they think only reason to learn foreign language."	I_S0
"However, other people have different opinion."	I_S0
"They think learning forieign language can make more friends."	I_S0
"Due to the fact that foreign people will fell friendly if you use their language to talk with them."	I_S0
"Beside, wo can know foreign information in the first time."	I_S0
"That means is wo can direct know information without transformation."	I_S0
"Such as newspaper, novel and movie."	I_S0
"It is very convinced to understand these by ourselves without other help and can save our many time."	I_S0
"At the same time, we can konw their culture better."	I_S0
"All in all, learn a foreign language only in order to travel and work is partly right because they want to live better in the other counter, however, i hope more people learn foreign language not only to work."	I_S0

"Obviously ,many different type of work canbenificial for them to keep the motivation on job and easy to make them fell happy,most of the woker belive that they can not  endure the the boring mchanically work,however, many different type of work may causeing them felling more badly."	B_M1
"Different type of work wil always forceing the worker to face new challenges ,and spend more time to finish every kind of tasks,sooner,they will fell tired and quite stressful ,then theywill decrease the movitation until they give up this job."	E_M1
"this shows them unhappy wil doning repeting work will only make them boring,but not lose the motivation."	B_S2
"From what has been disgust above ,we can easily arrive the conclution that to doing the the similar tasksall day long will make worker fell happer than let them have plenty of different types of tasks to do during the workday."	E_S2
 
"According to the reading materials, the Mayan empire, known as one of the three former Columbian American empires, disappeared due to wars of aggression or population explosion according to two different theories."	B_I0
"However, the professor in the lecture thought the two theories were incorrect."	E_I0
"The reasons are as follows."	S_T0
"First of all, it is totally different from the view in the reading materials that the invasion of the Turks led to the disappearance of the Mayan empire."	S_M1
"According to the professor, the invasion took place between 500 and 600 years, two centuries earlier than the theoretical view."	B_S0
"In addition, when we go back to that time, there is actually no connection between the Mayan empire and the tolteks in Mexico."	I_S0
"So that's why the invasion couldn't bring down the Empire."	E_S0
"Second, despite the statement in the readings that a population explosion without enough crops and water could lead to the disappearance of the Mayan empire, the professor holds the opposite view."	S_M1
"She believed that the people of the Mayan empire were very knowledgeable, so they were able to overcome many difficulties in growing crops."	B_S0
"So it's impossible to imagine the Empire disappearing without enough crops."	I_S0
"Moreover, the north of the Empire was actually much drier than the south, but the fact was that the south of the Empire was the first to fall."	I_S0
"Such dryness would not lead to the collapse of the Mayan empire."	E_S0
"In short, these reasons can explain why the professors in the lecture disagree with the opinions in the reading materials."	S_C2
 
"Watching TV has been a part of daily routine of people."	S_T1
"As the TV channels increasing rapidly, the public have different views on it, some of them think that it is great for people who have more choices with more channels."	B_S0
"While others think the more channels will lead to poorer quality programs."	I_S0
"And I am agree with both views in some extent."	I_S0
"Everyone of the public has the different preferences."	I_S0
"Some of them like entertaiment programs, while others like watching news."	I_S0
"The TV programs could satisfied them with more channels so that people have different choices."	I_S0
"Comparing with the past, TV programs were only a few with just only some news, and the public were bored with those programs."	I_S0
"Nowadays, there are various kinds of programs, and people are attracted by them."	I_S0
"And people could gain more information from them, they can learn konwledge from the channels like Discovery, or enjoy the movies at home with watching HBO."	I_S0
"By contrast, the quality of TV programs will decresed by the more TV channels appeard."	I_S0
"The editors of these TV channels have not sufficient time to product the programs with excellent quality."	I_S0
"For example, there are too many programs about the blind dating, and most of them are the same."	I_S0
"People could distinguish the different between them which has the same model, and it will lead the public too tired to watch the TV programs."	I_S0
"IIn addition,some channel productors ignore the contexts with satisfing the public, which will lead some negative impact on society."	I_S0
"The programs maybe with some violence or bulling will influenced the youth."	I_S0
"And that is what we should be attention."	I_S0
"In conclusion, the TV channels should ensure the quality of the programs while product the more channels at the same time."	E_S0

"Big success always appears together with big risk."	I_S0

"In this era of rrapid development ，all walks of life become more and more better."	E_I0
"In this case，some people think successful people try new things and take risks tather than only doing what they already how to do well and I don not agree with that."	S_T0

"Of course they may not as much tired as those workers do."	I_S0
"But they require a better skills than those workers, so as far as I am concerned, It is a good thing for those in senior management gain much salaries than other worker in the same company."	I_S0
"The social is developing, what make us progress is knowledge."	I_S0
"And a better academic dgree should be acquire a higher salaries than those worker."	I_S0

"The tables show the amount of money spent on Fairtrade coffee and bananas in two separate years in the UK, Switzerland, Denmark, Belgium and Sweden."	S_I0
"It is clear that sales of Fairtrade coffee rose in all five European countries from 1999 to 2004, but sales of Fairtrade bananas only went up in three out of the five countries."	S_M0
"Overall, the UK saw by far the highest levels of spending on the two products."	S_S2
"In 1999, Switzerland had the highest sales of Fairtrade coffee, at €3 million, while revenue from Fairtrade bananas was highest in the UK, at €15 million."	S_M0
"By 2004, however, sales of Fairtrade coffee in the UK had risen to €20 million, and this was over three times higher than Switzerland’s sales figure for Fairtrade coffee in that year."	B_S1
"The year 2004 also saw dramatic increases in the money spent on Fairtrade bananas in the UK and Switzerland, with revenues rising by €32 million and €4.5 million respectively."	E_S1
"Sales of the two Fairtrade products were far lower in Denmark, Belgium and Sweden."	S_M0
"Small increases in sales of Fairtrade coffee can be seen, but revenue remained at €2 million or below in all three countries in both years."	B_S1
"Finally, it is noticeable that the money spent on Fairtrade bananas actually fell in Belgium and Sweden."	E_S1
 
"Nowadays, it is said that living in a big city is bad for people's health."	B_T1
"In my opinion, it is not a big deal to live in a big city."	E_T1
"A huge number of people thinks that the air polution is pretty serious because of the factories and some industry."	B_S0
"However, it is not that scary as they said because the government is controlling the polution, so the poplution will not be that scary to effect people's health."	I_S0
"In the big city, meals are more colorful, so people can gain more nutrition than in the small town, that can give people healthier body."	I_S0
"Beside, the live of people who live in the big city is more regular."	I_S0
"For example, most people in big cities have the job which start at the same time in the morning, and finish their work at the same time in the afternoon, so they have to eat on time and sleep on time to make sure that they can work and live normally."	I_S0
"So their habit is pretty healthy."	I_S0
"Another reason is that people have better technology in the big city."	I_S0
"For instance, in the big city, they have the hospital with higher technology, so people will not be hurted a lot because of illness."	I_S0
"The last reason is that living in the big city is better for people's mental health."	I_S0
"Because there is a huge number of people in the big city, people can socialize, like communicate with others when they feel lonely."	I_S0
"Out of the big city, there will not be a lot of people to talk with."	I_S0
"In conclusion, living in big cities is not bad for people's health, but also good for their health."	E_S0

"The gap among these six types of fuel is predicted to widen in the last four years,among which the consumption of petrol and oil was the largest."	B_M0
"The USA saw a similar trend in consumption of nuclear solar/wind and hydropower."	E_M0
"A rising trend was seen in energy produced by nuclear and solar/wind rising from 4q to 6q and 4q to 5q respectively from 1980-2030."	B_S1
"The consumption of hydropower levels off at 4 q during this period."	E_S1
"From 20q and 15q respectively in 1980,gas showed an initial fall and coal a gradual increase,with the two fuels equal between 1985 and 1990,The consumption of natural gas was predicted to be overtaken by coal conterpart in 2014."	S_M0

"For the first option, evaporating the lake's water surely decreases the salinity of the lake but some chemicals which dissolved in the water and will do harm to human's health will be left behind."	B_S0
"If these chemicals come into the air, it will cause big problems to human's health."	I_S0
"When it comes to the second solution, the lecture tells that the government does not have enough money to support such a program."	I_S0
"The lecture also says that the third solution is not easy to realize."	E_S0
 
"The passage made three arguments to support that the structure were not created by the bees."	S_I0
"However, the professor in the lecture claims that the evidence used by the skeptics are not convincing."	S_T1
"First, the passage claims that there is no fossil remains been found 200 years ago, so bees were not likely to exist on that time."	S_M0
"In contrast, the professor argues that the reason why fossils have not been preserved is because the lack of fossilized trees that produce the resin( liquid that can help to preserve the fossil), without the trees, many fossil are not able to be preserved."	S_S2
"Secondly, the passage states that there is no flowering plants existed in 200 years ago, so the bees are not likely to exist."	S_M0
"On the contrary, the professor claims that it true that flowering plants have a mutual connection with the bees, but it is likely that the bees feeding on non-flowering plants during that time, when flowering plants evolved, they began to feeding on them, and the relationship between them is stable since then."	S_S2
"Lastly, the passage asserts that the fossilized evidence been found is lack of details, such as the spiral caps."	S_M0
"Nevertheless, the professor in the listening mentions that the chemical evidence proved that the bees in the past use the same special water that contains special material as the modern bees."	S_S2

"In my view, prohibition of advertising is not necessary, so I do not agree with this opinion."	B_S0
"Although,  some advertisments are not good for children, there are still some advantages of them."	I_S0
"Some advertisements can provide positive and accurate informations to children and their parents."	I_S0
"For example, if a mother wants to buy a baby carriage to her child, she can get some informations from advertisements."	I_S0
"In this way , she can buy a comfortable and safe one to her child."	I_S0
"However, if she can not watch advertising to get information, she may not choose a good one to her child."	I_S0
"In this case , the bad baby carriage may damage to child."	I_S0
"So  advertisements that appear on TV or internet is a good way for parents to show concern and love to their children."	I_S0
"On the other hand, some advertisements are good for developments of children."	I_S0
"There are many public service advertisments which are about morality  in TV or other place."	I_S0
"In this advertisings children can learn many knowledge."	I_S0
"For instance,  if a child watches a advertising which is ahout how to respect  other people, the child may  know that he need to respect and how to respect others."	I_S0
"Undoubtedlly, it is  a good things to developments of children."	I_S0
"Therefore , not all advertisements are harmful to children, so the prohibition to advertising is not a good idea."	I_S0
"The dicussion of these facts lead to conclusion that advertisements aimed at children may have negative influences on children."	I_S0
"However , it is still a good way for parents and children to get information."	I_S0

"these days,with the prevailing of the internet, the computer has conquered the lives of all human beings, people work on it, students study with it, even children begin to play games on it instead of doing outdoor activities."	B_I0
"therefore, the issue of whether students should be allowed to play computer games gained much debate."	I_I0
"some people think it is a waste of  time."	E_I0
"and this opinion also goes to me."	S_T0
"first and foremost, playing computer games will harm children's eyes seriously."	S_M1
"after the hard work of thier school study, children's eye have undertaken much pressure."	B_S0
"and if we still allow the children to play the computer games on the computher or mobile phone, this is defetidely a deeper hurt on their eyes."	I_S0
"there is no way to let them feel relax on physical."	I_S0
"like my niece, after playing a game called dota for year duringhis leisuretime, he cant see things in distance without glasses,aslo he get fatter and fatter owning to his lackness in sports."	E_S0
"secondly, children are really get indulged in the computer games  easily, so they will think about the games all the time even if they are studying in the classroom."	S_M1
"this will causing their time during the classroom becoming useless."	B_S0
"for example, jake who is a second grade students, he always talks about the plots ang stategy in the camputer games during the 10 mins break during the school time."	I_S0
"but 10 mins is not always enough to express himself, so he began to send messages on the phone with his so-called paterners to go on the talk during the classtime."	I_S0
"so this is a definete ly waste of time, he learned nothing in claaromm, ang go on playing the games after the class."	E_S0
"nevertheless, i admit that some kinds of games are really delicated in pictures, and the plot of the story is really amazing, all of these factors can only show it is a good way to kill time, but not a good excuse for children to play the computer games, because thier eyes will be harmed and time will get wasted."

"In my opinion, I don't think that it is the best way to improve public health by increasing the number of sports facilities."	S_T1
"There are three reasons to support my point."	B_S0
"The first, if you set public sports facilities ,it will take you so much money and time."	I_S0
"Alomst all the sports facilities are made of metal, it is not a please thing if you take a lot but people seldom take exercise there."	I_S0
"The second, if you appeal public to get the sports facilities at home, they don't have enough place to arrange for them."	I_S0
"Also, if no one can give them a prompting when they are in tend to give up, forgive me that I have no reason to persuade myself to believe that everyone can do exersice regularly."	I_S0

"The figure shows the different ways Australian households use energy and their corresponding greenhouse emissions"	O
"As can be seen from the figure, Australia's households use the most energy by heating, accounting for 42% of the total energy, but only 15% of the total greenhouse gas emissions."	S_M0
"Therefore, heating is not the main way to produce greenhouse gases."	S_S2
"Secondly, cooling uses the least energy, accounting for only 2% of the total energy, and its corresponding greenhouse gas emissions only account for 3% of the total."	S_M0
"Therefore, cooling is not the main way to produce greenhouse gases."	S_S2
"The biggest difference between the two figures is other appliances."	S_M0
"Australian households use 15% of their energy for other appliances and generate 28% of the total greenhouse gases, nearly doubling the proportion."	B_S0
"So, other electrical appliances are one of the biggest killers of greenhouse gases."	I_S0
"The energy used by Australian households for lighting is not much, only accounting for 4% of the total energy."	I_S0
"It is the second lowest use after cooling."	I_S0
"However, the greenhouse gas produced by lighting accounts for 8% of the total 。output, accounting for a full doubling of the proportion."	I_S0
"Its power cannot be underestimated."	E_S0
"Then look at water heating, which also accounts for a large proportion in the two figures."	S_M0
"Australian households use 30% of their energy for water heating, and produce 32% of the total greenhouse gases, with little change in the proportion difference."	B_S1
"We can only say that although water heating does not produce too many greenhouse gases, Australian households use too much energy for water heating, with a large base, so it naturally accounts for a large part of the total emissions."	E_S1
"The energy used for refrigeration accounts for 7% of the energy, and the greenhouse gas produced by refrigeration accounts for 14%, which also doubles."	B_C1
"Therefore, refrigeration is also one of the culprits of greenhouse gas production."	E_C1
 
"Recently,there's a trend in China that the old tried to pretent to fall down and appeal strangers to help them."	B_I0

"Considering the phenomenen happended in China,it's undoubt that people today are less to help the struggling strangers."	I_I0
"But I stand on the oppost point on this topic."	E_I0
"From my point of view,people are still and even more likely to help the strangers who are in trouble."	S_T0
"So,there are some evidences which can support my view."	S_M1
"Firstly,in the past few years,the relationship between our neibor was coming more harmonious."	B_S0
"In my daily life,it's common to see people who have some useless cloth and they tend to send them to the poor even they do not have any relationship."	I_S0
"More and more children are willing to donante thier comedies and textbook to the village school where they have never been to."	E_S0
"Secondly,from my point of view,even between contray and ocntray the relationship seems to be harmonious."	S_M1
"For example,China tries to bulid railways for some African contouries so that many young enigeers from China comes to the unfamiliar country to help those unknown poor people."	S_S2

"Reasons are as follows."	S_T0
"First of all, you can gain different knowledges in the process of discussion while working together."	S_M2
"Students have a variety of backgrounds and major in differnt subjects, therfore their exprience and knowledge differs."	B_S0
"And you can hear them as a suppliment."	I_S0
"Take myself as an example."	I_S0
"I majors in mecanical engineering."	I_S0
"When I was in a project to make a robot which can draw maps simulatously based on their sight and deliver something to a specific place, I can help them with their trouble in mecheinal design."	I_S0
"But when it comes to embadded systems, I always reaide my questions to students major in electronic enginering or computer science."	I_S0
"In this way, we help with each other and managed to make it in a shorter time than expected if we made them seperately."	E_S0
"On top of that, a brainstorm in a work-together project will help us come uo with more creative ideas in shorter time."	S_S2

"There is a tendency that people work and study for a long period of time without enough exercise to keep healhy."	B_S0
"In this case, doing physical exercise is pretty important for people to relax."	I_S0
"For example, my younger brother, who studies in high school now, hardly ever takes part in extra activities due to large quantities of workloads at school everyday."	I_S0
"For one time, he got seriously ill for lack of sports."	I_S0
"Finally his parents took him to see a doctor and he was suggested to do exercise everyday."	I_S0
"And later took some time for running a day and kept it a habit."	I_S0
"He got recovered within a week time and realized the importance of outdoor exercise."	I_S0
"Therefore, by doing physical exercise, people can not only relax but also keep healthy."	E_S0

"They belive that if the number of the TV channels is too large, the quality of TV programme can not be guaranteed."	I_S0
"The number of good actors , scriptwriters and directors is limited."	I_S0
"The vigor is limited for a person which means it is difficult to concentrate on too many things."	I_S0
"The more important thing is that fund of a TV station is restricted."	I_S0
"Thus the quality of the pragrams is doomed to be decreased if there are too many TV channels."	I_S0
"In my opinion, the quantity of TV channels should be restricted in a proper number."	I_S0
"When I was young, there were only a few TV channels so that I had a few choices."	E_S0
 
"In modern society's high-paced life, people are easy to feel tired because of long time work or study, what can we do to relax ourself?"	B_I0
"By watching a movie or reading a book ?"	I_I0
"Or by doing physical exercise?"	E_I0
"I prefer the first one."	S_T0
"There are several reasons for that."	S_S2
"First, movies and books are easier to make you calm down, while doing physical exercise can not."	S_M0
"When you watch a movie or reading a book you may feel as if you are in that situation and you are experience the same thing as the writer describes."	B_S1
"But if you do physical exercise, you may just feel tired and exhausted, there are no other things it can help."	E_S1
"Second, watching a movie or reading a book you needn't move, you can just rest on a sofa and then enjoy yourself,  use your favirote posture, sit, lie, inside home or outside your house, it is good for people who are lazy and not willing to move at all and you have many options."	S_M0

"In the passage, the author talks about three theories about main causes of the extinction of sea cows, whereas the professor refutes such view by saying that we still don't know what causes the extinction of sea cows."	S_I0
"Firstly, the author points out that the sea cows were overhunted to extinction by native Siberian people."	S_M0
"The professor, on the contrary, holds a different perspective."	B_S0
"More specifically, sea cows was an enormous creature."	I_S0
"And because the population of Siberian people wasn't very large, they didn't need to hunt a great number of sea cows."	I_S0
"So the sea cows couldn't be brought to the point of extinction by overhunting."	E_S0
"Secondly, according to the author, the decline of kelp, the main source of food of sea cows, caused by ecosystems disturbances was related to the extinction of sea cows."	S_M0
"Nevertheless, the professor thinks otherwise."	B_S0
"As the professor explains, if there was something happened to the ecosystem, not only the sea cows, but also other parts of ocean would be influenced, like the marine animals."	I_S0
"But there were not reports that the population of  whales, a kind of  marine animals, declined in that time."	I_S0
"And since there was no evidence of huge environment problems, kelps were likely to live well, so sea cows couldn't face the risks of food shortage."	E_S0
"Lastly, the reading maintains that the arrival of European food traders contributed to the extinction of sea cows, which contradicts the professor's points."	S_M0
"According to the professor, when the Europeans arrived, the population of sea cows was already small."	B_S0
"So there must be something serious happened before the arrival of Europeans."	I_S0
"No matter what it was, the main cause of extinction of sea cows shouldn't be European traders who were just to arrive in this place."	E_S0

"firstly, we live in a high-paced society nowadays."	B_S0
"just take clothes as an example, many people don't have enough time to wash it, so they choose to throw it away and buy newer and more fashionable clothes instead."	I_S0
"besides, the things are more cheaper than before."	I_S0
"owing to the fierce competition these days, the things are not as expensive as before."	I_S0
"for example, the cell phones."	I_S0
"the appearance and technology of the cell phone are improved quickly these days, in order to catch up the trend, people throw away the old one and but the new one."	E_S0
"while it may cause some drawbacks."	S_M1
"the worst result it may be cause is the damage of the environment."	B_S0
"tons of rubbish may be created if people throw away things in a short time."	I_S0
"if the people use the things for a long time, the environment may be as clean as before."	I_S0
"besides, when the adult throw things, the kids may follow their behavior, which will break the Chinese traditional merits."	I_S0

"Both the reading and the lecture are talking about turning the hand writting records of medical informations to electronic recording ways, but the speaker disagrees with the perspective made in the reading material that electronic records should be widely used by doctors."	O
"It is stated in the passage that with using electronic records, the costs of storing and transporting medical recording documents can be saved."	S_M0
"While the lecturer cast doubt on it by claiming that even if hospitals use electronic records, hand writting documents are still needed to be storing and transferring as a usage of back up."	S_S2
"Furthermore, the reading claims that with electronic records, there will be less errors made by illegible handwriting."	S_M0
"In contrary, the professor maintains that the errors will actually increase by using electronic records, since doctors still use pen and paper to record the medical informations in the first place and it is their assistant or staff who really turn the scripts to the electronic records and will make more mistakes."	S_S2
"Finally, the professor in the listening material, cast doubt on the point holds by the passage which is about the researching use of the electronic records."	S_M0
"Concerning about the strict privacy laws in America, the medical informations about the patients can be use only after gaining their permisions and lots of other procedures."	B_S1
"So it has little possibility to be used by any research locations."	E_S1
"Therefore, the speaker departs from the opinion on the topics made in the reading."	S_C2
 
"The reading and the listening have different views on whether some paintings attributed to Rembrandt were actually painted by him."	B_I0
"Reading suggests that one painting could not be a work by Rembrandt."	E_I0
"First, reading shows that the woman’s dress is so luxurious that no servant could afford."	S_M0
"however, the professor says that some analyses indicate that the fur collar is not originally painted by Rembrandt."	B_S1
"It was added by others after the painting had been made to make the painting seems more valuable."	E_S1
"Second, reading suggests that light and shadow on this painting didn’t fit together, and Rembrandt won’t make such mistake, so the painting was not painted by Rembrandt."	S_M0
"Whereas, the listening mentions that when color removed, the original color could be seen."	B_S0
"And because the original woman’s dress was a simple light-colored cloth, parts of woman’s face was illuminated."	I_S0
"Hence, the original light and shadow of painting is very realistic, which just like what we expected from Rembrandt."	E_S0
"Finally, reading proposes that panel of painting was made of wood glued that Rembrandt won’t use."	S_M0
"Nevertheless, professor considers that when fur collar was added, the wood panel will also enlarge to make the painting seems more grand, so actually the original painting was painted on a single wood."	B_S1
"At the same time, in fact, a piece of wood was made of same tree like other paintings that Rembrandt made."	E_S1
 
"How to work more effectively is a highly-debated issure nowadays."	B_I0
"Different people may contend various ideas."	E_I0
"Some people may think that people work in a group can be benefical."	B_T0
"However, others consider that working alone is more effective."	E_T0
"In my point of view, it is more effective for students that work alone on projects."	S_T1
"To begin with, students who do the work by himself can have a more quiet environment."	S_M1
"If students work in a group."	B_S0
"There is a unaviod disscussion between groupmates, so there must be a lot of noise."	I_S0
"Acoording to authoriy's reserch data, indicating that people in a quiet space can easier to focus on one thing, and most people who stay in a enquiet space will be disturbed by noise, and they can only get fifty percents concentration on their work."	I_S0
"Therefore, quiet space is significant for people."	E_S0
"Secondly, students work in a group usually take risks that getting lower grades."	S_M1
"Sometime, people are forced to have a group with strangers, including some free-riders, they just wait for the results, even most of time they chatting  something for fun."	B_S0
"Fortehmore, there also some people who do not like the topic of reaserch, and they complain all day which will have a negative effect on the group's atmosphere."	I_S0
"In some bad situation, the negative energy of these people will insect others."	I_S0
"As a result, all the people in the group have no motivation to complete the assignments, and then get a terrible grades."	E_S0
"To conclude, students work alone on the projects is better that work in a group."	B_C0
"They are not adults, they hard to control themselves when they work with others who have the same age with them."	I_C0
"Therefore, students will be easily interfered by others or giving up the projects and playing with groupemates."	I_C0
"That really waste a lot of time, Which is very precious for students."	E_C0
 
"With the development of improved medical care, more and more people can live longer ."	S_T0
"However, with several problems  appearing, many people think that adventages of its development outweigh its disadvantages."	B_T1
"I hold the idea that its disadvantages are more than advantages."	E_T1
"Recently, many social problems have appeared because of growing of population."	S_M1
"For example , the prices of house have been increasing greatly and many young people are jobless and unemployed because of  older employees at work  ."	B_S0
"Also, the rate of traffic accidents is increasing and the cities are filled with trash ."	I_S0
"Besides,many pollution ,such as air pollution ,water pollution ,soil pollution and trash pollution,make the qualitity of people'lives decrease."	I_S0

"The increasing gap of the rich and the poor make the social development  unbalanced ."	I_S0

"However,as a saying goses,Every coin has two sides."	B_S1
"We should agree with its advantages ."	E_S1
 
"Have you ever heard the Bafelt learned how to control his finance in a young age?"	B_I0
"Of course not."	E_I0
"Some agree with that children should learn to manage their money when they were young."	S_T0
"However, I do not recommend this idea at all."	B_T1
"It is not a reasonable period for young people to control their money, and the first process should be the other way if the parents really want to cultivate a sense of finacial responsbility for their children."	I_T1
"I will express my point below this paragraph."	E_T1
"To begin with, managing money will distract children when they focus on studing."	S_M1
"As we know, 5-9 years old is a really key step for children to fundement their acdemic knowledge, it is not wise way to make them concentrate on the money."	B_S0
"For instance, I used to be tought to learn how to control my money by myself, the result was that I always thought about how many coins I left in my desk durng some major classes, such as English, Math, Chinese and even History."	I_S0
"That made my scoers declined dramatically, I sometime regreat it even for now."	E_S0
"In addition, it is unstable to give amount of money to a little child, there are some more suitable approaches for them to develop financial responsibility."	S_M1
"To take myself as an example, my dad used to tell me that I should pay everything I did bad."	B_S0
"Like breaking the windows, hitting the screen, punching others or playingfire."	I_S0
"I think these small things also can cultivate the responsibility for us."	I_S0
"Thus, we can have ability to manage our own finance."	E_S0
"Although, some say that it is helpful for children to make preparation for their future."	B_C1
"Nevertheless, I assert that each children can only get tiny money from their parents, which is not enough for them to learn something from that."	E_C1

"It is quite common these days for young people in many countries to have a break from studying after graduating from high school."	S_I0
"This trend is not restricted to rich students who have the money to travel, but is also evident among poorer students who choose to work and become economically independent for a period of time."	S_T1
"The reasons for this trend may involve the recognition that a young adult who passes directly from school to university is rather restricted in terms of general knowledge and experience of the world."	S_M1
"By contrast, those who have spent some time earning a living or traveling to other places, have a broader view of life and better personal resources to draw on."	B_S1
"They tend to be more independent, which is a very important factor in academic study and research, as well as giving them an advantage in terms of coping with the challenges of student life."	E_S1
"However, there are certainly dangers in taking time off at that important age."	S_M1
"Young adults may end up never returning to their studies or finding it difficult to re-adapt to an academic environment."	B_S0
"They may think that it is better to continue in a particular job, or to do something completely different from a university course."	I_S0
"But overall, I think this is less likely today, when academical qualifications are essential for getting a reasonable career."	E_S0
"My view is that young people should be encouraged to broaden their horizons."	S_C2
"That is the best way for them to get a clear perspective of what they are hoping to do with their lives and why."	B_S1
"Students with such a perspective are usually the most effective and motivated ones and taking a year off may be the best way to gain this."	E_S1

"During the recent years, the rapid development of global economy 
attracts the attention from the many government around world."	S_T1
"Some of governments claim they will emphasize the economic progress, while others believe that they are supposed to attach equal importance to the developments of other aspects."	B_S0
"From my perspective, I partly agree with the former view and mainly advocate the latter one."	I_S0
"To some extent, it is reasonable for some governments to put the economic development on the most crucial position, for the reason that they sincerely hope to make country become increasing prosperous and strong so that there is no country daring to invade or violate them."	I_S0
"Therefore, the economic boom becomes their major goal."	I_S0
"On the other hand, there are also other programs which are the same important as the economy."	I_S0
"For instance, it is indispensible for the governments to promote the education development for the reason that children symbolize the future of their countries and will become the nation's pillars."	I_S0
"Furthermore, the technology development  cannot be neglected such as the AI(artificial intelligence) and some practical technological invention like the housework assistant appliances which are able to make citizen's life handier and relieve  people's stress when they come back home after work."	I_S0
"As a result, improving people's the sense of happiness is also a keypoint to make a thriving and powerful country."	I_S0
"Additionally, technological progress can be the representative of evaluating a country's status as well."	I_S0

"In the future,it appears that the shops along the north side of Main Road are going to be demolished to make way for a bus station,a shopping centre,a car park and new housing area."	S_M1

"I disagree with that group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel."	S_I0
"In my opinion, the best way is traveling by ourselves, because we can control our own time and travel flexibly."	S_T0
"Firstly, if we travel by a tour guide, we can't contral our own time."	S_M2
"The tour guide usually has a schedule that don't give us enough time to enjoy the travelng."	B_S0
"I have the similar experience: in a summer vacation, my mother and I joined a group to travel Shanxi."	I_S0

"As another discussion,it' s limited that TV channels can only lead to a lot of poor quality TV programs."	I_S0

"Nowsdays, young people must face many kinds of difficulties in this rapidly developing society."	S_I0
"In my opinion, young people always meet some challage that too strict for them."	S_T1
"Firstly, the emloyment pressure in that societies today is really high, young people must try to do everything best which they can do."	S_M0
"In addition, there are too many young people but there are not always thave enough jobs for them, so young people must develop some other talents or get some outstanding achievement, otherwise they can not get a job."	B_S1
"For example, one of my sister was graduated of a normal university last year, although she has a good grade in school and she is a very hardworking people, there are not any company wants her because she is just a unevevtful person."	E_S1
"Secondly, the gap between the rich and the poor become more and more hard to overcome."	S_M0
"The family which rich and powerful will spend a lot of money to nuture their children."	B_S0
"Moreover, they can get more converience than other normal family, so it is really hard for those normal family's children to get good education in their childhood, when  they are grow up, they will find that there are too may people who are better then them and they only can stay in the same social bracket as their parents."	I_S0
"There are only few people can break this rule to into a better ocial bracket."	E_S0
"Finally, in today's society, most of people do not need to worry about how to survival, they bacome to worry about something else like spiritual level or living quality."	S_M0
"When people need to think about these things, that means nowsdays young people will have a higher firld of vision than before, they become worry about the eqality of life and the life style."	B_S0
"So they need to worry about buy a house or car and whether or not have enough money to have a baby or take care their parents."	I_S0
"Such as myself, when oneday that i realize that maybe i can not have the same living quality after i adullt that i have to feed muself, so i must earn more money not just do not let myself survival."	E_S0
"All in all, the rules that societies today expect young people to follow and obey are too strict, young people must face many things that they can not escape or avoid, the only thing they can do is be more hardworking and let themselevs better."	S_C2
 
"With the develop of the technology, whether the technology is good for children or not is debatable."	B_I0
"Some people think that techology has made children less crearive than the past because technology make children just stare at the screen and think nothing at all."	I_I0
"While other people argue that the technology displat a wider world to the children which can inspire children's imaginatition."	E_I0
"However, I strongly believe that technology has certainly made chidren more creative, here are thr reasons."	S_T1
"First of all, like most supporter think, it show children a more colorful world."	S_M0
"In the past, because of the lack of the advanced equipment, all one child can see and think is just a small world around her."	B_S0
"But now is totally different, we can appreciare the intriguing word whenever we like."	I_S0
"Like we can enjoy world's seven wonders just through our computers; we can know the extreme places of the world which we can't even imagine...... "	I_S0
"Can this happen in the past?"	I_S0
"The answer is certainly "no‘’！"	E_S0

"Recent years, there is a heated reccent years on the environment improvement."	S_T1
"Some suggest that only governments and big companies can make influence on it, while others believe that individuals can improve enviroment."	B_S0
"As for me, I agree with the latter one."	I_S0
"People has several reasons to agree the former one."	I_S0
"Above all, only big organazations, such as factories, can reduce the idustrial pollution."	I_S0
"Due to the fact that they produce mass pollution, it is important for them to have a change to improve environmet."	I_S0
"For example, medical factories in my coutry always flow a lot of poisonous pollution into the rivers."	I_S0
"If they run less pollution into the rivers, great good changes can be taken placed in environment."	I_S0
"Moreover, governments can enact policies or laws to force idividuals and big companies in order to improve environment."	I_S0
"People are always cared of policies and laws which may put them into the prison."	I_S0
"Due to the fearness of laws and policies, people have to obey them."	I_S0
"Then, it can also improve environment."	I_S0
"Howerver, other people hold an opposite perspective."	I_S0
"FIrst, they believe that individuals can improve the environment step by step."	I_S0
"Though it costs time, it is a long-term approach."	I_S0
"For an prime example, everyone produce pollution everday, but we only reduce a little."	I_S0
"However, we have a huge amount of population (over 70 billion), so it also produce a lot everyday."	I_S0
"In addition, people are willing to do what they want to do instead of what they are not likely to do."	I_S0
"Therefore, it will show a better result if citizens are truly want to improve the environment."	I_S0
"Besides, both governmets and big companies consist with indivaduals."	I_S0

"If one were to ask me, I would say that it is a positive development."	S_T0
"In the past, the friends we made were the people who around us due to the limit of the activity range and the face-to-face talks dominated the daily communications."	S_M0
"Only by sending a letter or a radio could we have an interaction with people far away which were less efficient."	B_S1
"However, now we have modern communication tools thus we do not have to use the traditional ways which prompts the efficiency a lot."	E_S1
"What’s more, talking with friends on the internet and sending an instant message are no longer a barrier for us and thanks to the technology such as WeChat, messenger and so on we can even make foreign friends as well."	S_M0

"This is because people are now increasingly abandoning face to face interactions and prefer carrying out their communication behind closed doors."	B_S1

"However,I assume that it could bring a wide variety of convenience to the contemperary society."	I_S0
"First of all ,the tendency boost the development of local economy."	I_S0
"As more and more international companies come to the local place in order to seek for further market,they would bring sufficient resources,be them techonlogy or job opportunies,thus being able to give local people access to advanced techonlogy or chances to be employed."	I_S0
"Thereafter,people who are able to have practical skills or technology would not be worried about their life and could have a quality life."	I_S0
"Additionally,local governments also release financial burden from it."	I_S0
"With the domestic business compete or cooperate with the international companies, products with various bands and quality are manufactured to cater for everyone's need."	I_S0
"Local governments could receive more tax revenues through these competition."	I_S0
"Admittedly,this situation would be negative to some extent."	I_S0
"Fore instance,India is a kind of country which is similar to lots of Asian country nowadays and lots of local companies have bad benefits"	E_S0

"First,money is one of the most directly way for to make kids happy."	B_S0
"Many parents try to discribe bright future to encourge their kids to learn but in vain."	I_S0
"That is because kids cannot understand many things which adult concern."	I_S0
"Money will be a execllent motivation for kids to study well."	I_S0
"For example,you tell your little son about all the glory and advantages after entering IVY,and turn out that they do not pay any attention to that which is too far away from them."	I_S0
"So why not use something they can accept easier to make them do right things?"	I_S0
"Second,by doing so will teach kids a social rules:you cannot have anything untill you pay for it."	I_S0
"Knowing nothing comes free mature a kid rapidly."	I_S0
"They will aware that only self-effort can bring them good life,and parents and anyone else cannot offer help and love to you forever."	I_S0
"Thirdly,teaching kids to use money correctly is important."	I_S0

"The free opening of public educational and cultural facilities such as museums is undoubtedly a good thing."	B_I0
"Museum carries the social function of record culture, and its public welfare and non-profit nature have long been the social consensus."	I_I0
"Museums are open to the public free of charge and have become customary in many countries."	I_I0
"However, the free opening of museums is a challenge to the national quality, the management ability of museums, and the ruling ability of relevant government departments."	I_I0
"Some of the problems caused by the museum's free opening were unexpected."	E_I0
"In order to solve these problems, I think it is feasible for museums to charge admission fees and have more advantages than disadvantages."	S_T0
"Firstly, the limited funds and insufficient personnel of museums seriously hinder the development of museums."	S_M1
"The museum's cost is severely hampered by the fact that it has been opened free of charge since it did not receive tickets."	B_S1
"The lost tickets revenue is the financial burden of the state, in which the increased operating costs are also subsidized by the state finance."	E_S1
"Secondly, the tourists with different qualities all come to the museum to visit and appreciate, which virtually increases the burden of the museum."	S_M1
"In my city, because children are still young and their parents neglect their discipline, they often ignore the warning words in the museum, and the phenomenon of frolicking and shouting has seriously affected the environment in the museum."	B_S1
"Charging admission can maintain order and create a good atmosphere of appreciation, it is recognized that visiting museums is to "visit culture" rather than "visit the excitement"."	E_S1
"In conclusion, although free visits to museums can promote the spread of culture and education and the development of local tourism, it brings financial pressure to museums and the country."	B_C1
"Therefore, appropriate fees can not only solve the problems of museum funds and management, but also give visitors a good sense of experience, draw from the spirit of self-cultivation, improve physical and mental quality, and drive more people to feel the heritage and charm of culture and art."

"However, I disagree with this idea."	S_T1

"I will illustrate my point for following reasons."	S_T1
"To begin with, social skills is important in our future job."	S_M1
"During our learning period, many of us neglect the significance of the ability to relate well to people."	B_S0

"It is the ability to relate well to people that help us to do our job better."	I_S0
"Also, people are too subjective to listen to others thoughts sometimes."	I_S0
"Only when you have the ability to relate well to people will they listen to your own ideas."	E_S0
"In addition, we can never attach too much significance to studying hard in school."	S_M1
"Knowledge you gained in school can benefits you in many aspects."	B_S0
"If your job is related to your major, what you learned in school build a solid foundation which you can benefit from it forever."	I_S0
"With relative knowledge, it will be easier for you to solve prefessional problems than others without these."	I_S0
"For instance, my father, who majored in engeneering, managed building project."	I_S0
"Owing to his professional knowledge, their project save much in design."	I_S0
"Even if your job is not related to your job, you can also benefit from your studying ability you gained in school."	I_S0
"The studying ability is not innate."	I_S0
"You must practice it again and again in your learning period so that you can study effecient by yourself in your future job."	E_S0

"First of all, as far as i'm concernd, more programs don't really mean more choices, high quality programs do."	S_T1
"What's more, due to the market competition, the quality of the program is likely to be better."	B_S0
"So, let me elaborate on my point for you."	I_S0
"Let's imagine that the TV is full of low-quality programs which you can't stand at all."	I_S0
"Will you continue to watch TV?"	I_S0
"So, we need to look at it in different situations."	I_S0
"If there are more and more programs which are full of knowledge and could broden your horizon, it's no doubt that we do have more choice to improve ourselves or just kill our time."	I_S0
"However, the truth is not always what we likes, there are often poor quality TV programs been created."	I_S0
"Alough more programs have been created, we won't make them, which means useless to us."	I_S0
"Next, let's turn our attention to another problem."	I_S0
"Too many TV channels if only leads to a lot of poor quality TV programs?"	I_S0
"I'm afraid not."	I_S0
"Every program aims to attract more people in order to get more benefit."	I_S0
"There are so many programs, how to stand out is a question."	I_S0
"The only way to achieve the goal is to improve their programs' quality."	I_S0
"As you can see, too many programs don't always lead to low quality."	I_S0

"In today's society everyone has their own work organization, some people only stay in one organization to work all their lives, but some people will change their jobs."	S_I0
"Some people think it's good to stay in an organization all the time."	S_M0
"They just need to get used to it and get their work done every day."	B_S1
"For these people, having a job all the time is a very stable, stable income, and they can do it to the best of their ability."	E_S1
"Others think they should change jobs a lot, so that they can accumulate each organization's different experiences and learn more."	S_M0
"It's also good for their lives, they have a rich life, a new work environment every once in a while, which allows them to experience their work time differently, and also makes them feel satisfied both physically and mentally."	S_S2

"Energy conserveation has been a concern for many people and it causes a topic that whether the most effective way for goernment is to encourage energy conservation is increasing the price of gasoline and electricity."	B_I0
"This debate divides people into different camps with different opinions, and some people would like to hold the opinion that increasing the price of gasoline and electricity is a good way."	E_I0
"However, when it comes to me, I consider funding researchers on new energy sources is better."	S_T0
"First and foremost, new energy sources makes it possible for people to save more energy."	S_M1
"To be more specific, since there are new energy sources, when people drive their car or take the public traffic, the pollution will be less sicne the new energy is solar and wind power which doesn't have bad effects on the environment."	B_S0
"In opposition, if the government spend nothing on the new energies, people will just use gas as their main sources to drive cars, and thsi can cause great dioxide released by the car will affect the environment a lot and cause global warming."	I_S0
"For example, according to one of my father's friends, who always driving a car that depends on the electricity as power source, he says that when he drives this car, it will releases less carbon dioxide to the environment, and then the environment can be protected in an efficient way."	E_S0
"In the second place, with more new energy sources, the government can get more access to fame that will bring them money to develop more new sources."	S_M1
"This is because when a country and other countries will pay them a lot since this technique can protect the environment a lot, they then will have mroe money that can not gain more fame, but also they can use this money to develop even more new energy sources that can protect the environment."	B_S1
"This pattern will finally lead to a good circle that can help spend no money on new sources, then when other countries have developed the method to utilize the solar or wind energy, they can just play to use this, in this way it will even cost them more and bring a heavy burden to this country in the long term."	E_S1
"Granted, it may be reasonable and attractive that some poeple claim that the goernment should encourage energy conservation by increasing the price of gasoline and electricity, since if the price of gasoline is increased, then less people will drive a car to go out which will be beneficial to the environment a lot."	B_C0
"However, it cannot hold water, since nowadays people's lives are really busy, so some poeple will still dirve a car to go out."	I_C0
"So I am still convinced by my standpoint that  funding researchers on new energy sources is better."	E_C0
 
"Limiting the mount of time children spend on electronic devices is a good way to protect  their eyes."	B_T1
"Because electronic equipments contain much radiation."	E_T1
"That's a main reason why there are many people have shortlight."	B_S0
"Being a shortlight may make them reduce the efficiency of lecture,because they can't see the blackboard clearly."	I_S0
"In the other hand,if kids are being shortlight,they have to take the glasses,It's not only expensive,but also have a bad influence of your appearance."	I_S0
"Take myself for example,since I was ten,I'm really  like to paly the computer game and watch television,my mother told me not too much time on screen,but I don't care about it ,and after two years ,my eyesight dropped  one hundred degrees."	I_S0
"now,I have to take the glasses."	I_S0
"with the development of technology,there are many new devices,attracting children who really interest about it ."	I_S0
"In order to prevent children from being affected by shortlight,we should limit  that children spend too much time on device"	E_S0
 
"The government welfare has become a more and more hot topic nowadays."	S_I0

"This essay will ananlysis both views, then propose the opinion of the author."	O
"It is obvious that there will be lots of benefits if the governmnet provide the welfare on public health care and education."	S_M1
"To begin with,this can protect the citizens intersts."	B_S0
"People nowadays are facing a number of pressures in their daily life, especially the young generation, let alone to pay for the health care and education."	I_S0
"It is the citizens interests to seek help from the government."	I_S0
"If the government pay for those cost, it will relieve the burden of citizens and protect their intersts."	I_S0
"In addition, this way can help the government attract lots of talents."	I_S0
"A number of governments are trying to bring lots of welfares to attract excellent person to their cities."	I_S0
"Paying for public health care and education is surely a really good idea."	I_S0
"Although the governments spend some money on it, they can gain lots of talents which can improve the development of their society."	E_S0
"However, there are also some reasons supporting that it is not the government responsibility to pay those cost."	S_M1
"First of all, the government should not let the citizens rely on them too much."	B_S0
"it is truely necessary for the citizens to take care of themselves wel."	I_S0
"More importantly, each parent should burden the responsibility to pay for their children's education."	I_S0
"If the government always pay lots of things that should be paid by citizens, people might always rely on the government."	I_S0
"When people lose there promotion to work hard, it will influence the development of the socialy in many aspects such as economy and technology."	I_S0
"In addition, this will give lots of burden to the government."	I_S0
"It is really a large cost on public health care and education."	I_S0
"If the government pay all of them, they would not have enough money to support other services."	E_S0
"In my opinion, both views are reasonable."	B_C1
"Therefore, I suggest that the government could pay some of the cost of public health and education, while others are paid by citizens themselves."	E_C1

"From my perspective, i would express my preference that know about events happening around the world is more suitable because knowing this can expand our horizons, cultivate inereat dirction and make more friends."	E_T1
"To begin with, knowing about events happening around the world provides people with the opportunity to expand our horizons."	S_M1
"To be more specific, to understand the dynamic of the world can be compared with your life or job and learn other countries good place."	B_S1
"On the contrary, if people choose to shield about events happening around the world, they will suffer form closed himself from the outside world."	E_S1
"In addition,  knowing about events happening around the world allows people to cultivate inereat dirction."	S_M1
"To some extent, can let more people know these national issues like poltics, maybe there is a chance to work after these people will go to government departments."	B_S1
"For instance, my friend is a introverted person, he never cares about the political problem, once he come with me to watch the news, since then fell in love with the problems between countries, because he through it was wonderful."	E_S1

"There are more and more people want to have a more advanced medical care whitch could give them a longer life."	S_T0
"Although increasing life expectancy is attractive and we can enjoy our beautiful life ,personally I hold a view that it should not be allowed because its disadvantages outweigh its advantages."	S_T1
"Improving medical care will increase peope's  economic burden."	S_M0
"Because government should pay a lot of money on the medical care,people such as some workers should be supported more tax to the government to make this project be successful which means most of people should spend more time on their work to pay tax or use these improved medical care but get less salary."	S_S2
"Also, if everyone could have a longer life in the future,our society will have more older man.but the number of teenagers will decrease."	S_M0

"In my opinion, it is very important for students to develop communication, attain maturity and develop professional attitudes and the later approach is the better way of achieving it."	E_T0
"First of all, this will prepare the students for higher education."	S_M0
"In the school student are no fully matured."	B_S0
"Even some remain childish in thinking and behaviour."	I_S0
"In the university, a student will meet with different types of peoples so there require a good understanding and mental maturity stage for that."	I_S0
"The university campus provides special and deep knowledge of particular field which require hard working and learning capability."	I_S0
"Because university education and teachers prepare the students to survive in the real world on his own basis any place, some prior travel and work experience would even accelerate it more."	E_S0
"Moreover, it will make one to understand the professional life."	S_M0
"This will provide important experience to a student to mange theirs studies with work, because in higher studies students have to finance their studies or to work in research laboratories."	B_S0
"Working at shop or small office will teach the students to understand the working pressure, cooperation with coworkers and complete the task in schedule."	I_S0

"Being a free walker match my opinion better."	S_T0
"My reasons are given below."	S_T1
"The primary reason is traveling without a tour guide is free."	S_M2
"I can not only plan the schedule of next day and systematically follow it, but also just fall in sleep without any thought and wandering in the countryside or taste delicious food near my hotel."	B_S0

"In modern societies, people's desire to travel from one city to another city for business, study and tourism and other affairs are becoming more and more urgent and practical, which explains that a rising number of people holds that the government should spend a large sum of money on new railway line constructions; however, some individuals believe that the money should be used on existing public transport."	S_T1
"This essay will discuss both opinions and include my views at last."	O
"Those in favour of constructing new rail lines regard cross-city railways as the symbol of modern civilization."	S_M1
"Many countries, especially developing countries such as China have devoted billions of GDP in modernization, which symbolizes social growth and improvement of rural-urban connection."	B_S0
"With cheaper and more convenient transportation, people could go to big cities for jobs and return home as quickly as they can."	I_S0
"People don't have to suffer a long and uncomfortable journey by coach or by ship as they did in the past."	E_S0
"Nonetheless, the opponents deem that the existing transportation service should be improved first before investing money in constructing new railway lines."	S_M1
"After all, there are still a lot of people working and living in one city."	B_S0
"The buses need to be modernized, the traffic jam needs to be solved, and the pollution problems caused by cars also need to be tackled."	I_S0
"It is an urgent and world-wide issue that should be put in high priority."	E_S0
"In my opinion, with more trains connecting among cities, people could enjoy a more convenient life; but improving the existing public transport and related problems should be our priority as it could ameliorate our present life to a larger extent."	S_C2
 
"Firstly,I agree with this opinion."	S_T1
"As far as i am concerned,i think that it is perfect for a company to 
let older staff in the same organisation to have much higher salaries."	B_S0
"Secondly,we all know that one chooses a company and works for it,the company paid for the one,it is a basic principle,however,a person may have liminted ability,he or she may not create a lot of value for his or her company,but he does for the company's harf working,year after year."	I_S0
"when he gets older,the company considered for humanitarian significance,should pay much higher for the employee."	I_S0
"Well,we all know that wanda is a great company in the world,if a staff work for it for ten years,though this gay have not create a lot of profit,wangda also paies much higher for him or her because of his loyal 、his life for the company."	I_S0
"We can also give a counter-example,ther is a company in my home town,it begin to develope very well,then it do not want to spend mony for its stuff,so it graduallu comes to disappreared at end."	I_S0
"Lastly,we can have a conculsion that it is a good thing for thoese in senior management positions to have much higer salaries than other woeker in the same company or organisation ."	I_S0
"it is surely a perfect ting to pay much highter for older employees ,because they will work harder ,pay more back to the company."	I_S0

"More and more TV channels ware created, people have more choices."	I_S0
"But there are two parts of people have different views about this situation."	I_S0
"Some think it is good, but others think it is not good."	I_S0
"In my opinion, I agree both views."	I_S0
"To begin with, having mor TV channles is good for people to have more choices."	I_S0
"Everyone has different habbbits."	I_S0
"For example, mostly women love  Korean TV Soaps,because they want to feel love and sadness; some older people like watching something about emey; and moay teen boys will be more interseting with superhero or fighting, etc."	I_S0
"When TV channels are becoming more and more, peolple will watch more themes of they liked."	I_S0
"So this proves that having more TV channles is a good thing."	I_S0
"In addition,people think too many TV channles only leads to many poor quality TV programes."	I_S0
"Sometimes, some poor TV channles will also be created when having more TV channles."	I_S0
"In our lives, some people want to make lots of moeny but they do not pay many their own time and moeny, so they created these poor workers one by one."	I_S0
"When people watch them, I believe that people just feel angry with them."	I_S0
"And we also lose our time."	I_S0
"Finally, in my opinion, I think this situation has adventages and disadventages."	I_S0
"Because we can have more choices to find some TV channles we realiy love."	I_S0
"But we still lose our own time on it, the feeling also will be bad."	I_S0
"All in all, when having more TV channles were created, people think they have more choices, and they also will watch some poor works."	I_S0
"But eveything has advantages and disadvantages, we cannot choose the exist of them,"	E_S0
 
"Both scientists and tourists are able to go to remote natural environments at present."	S_T1
"People have different opinions about this,some of them think it is very intrersting and the other oppose."	B_S0
"In my opinion,it is not a very good action ."	I_S0
"To start with,some impolite or under low-education-leveled people may do harmful behaviors to the envirnments."	I_S0
"They may litter causally or take photos of animals living there."	I_S0
"In this case,some valuable spiecies will be destroyed and ignored."	I_S0
"Fewer beautiful and clean atmosphere occured."	I_S0
"What is more,tourists may disturb the research process of scientists."	I_S0
"Scientists seem to have problems in doing research or recording."	I_S0
"Cutting down the process of the obsevation of some certain animals or plants may probably let them endangered,since scientists are trying to treating them."	I_S0
"In addition,some accidents may happen."	I_S0
"Wild animals may appear in any time."	I_S0
"There are few hospitals nearby,so you are in danger but cannot get proper treatment."	I_S0
"Nobody will responsible for this and you are supposed to undertake all of this on your own unfortunately."	I_S0
"It is sure that there are also advantages occuerd."	I_S0
"More people are allowed to experience the view of remote natural environment."	I_S0
"They can watch the charming scenes in person."	I_S0
"While there is a possibility that some of them will damage the view and let nobody watch them for ever."	I_S0
"To summary,more people can see detailed beauty but this have the risk of doing harm to the remote natural environment."	I_S0
"And it may diturb the processes of doing reseach and saving species."	I_S0
"So it offers more disadvantages that enable both scientists and tourists to go to remote natural envirnment."	E_S0
 
"With the sports facilities came in our view,many of them will say the public health will improved by sports facilities."	B_T0
"But in my opinion,to improve our public health is depend on ourselfs，not only sports facilities."	E_T0
"It is right that soprts facilities can help us to improve our health,and I cannot ignore the benifits of them."	S_M0
"However,the users of sports facilities most of them are children and elders and the young generation have no interest about it."	S_S2
"First of all,the proportion of young generation is the most in social and they are live in busy."	S_M0
"So the fast food and junk food can help them save enough time to work."	B_S0
"And the body of them can be damaged by fast food."	I_S0
"Besides,if they have no enough time to have food,why they can have extra time to use sports facilities?"	E_S0
"Another point we nust focus on is the comfort zone of young generation."	S_M0
"Human will naver act if they do not have a achivement."	B_S0
"Most of them still cannot  aware thet they are in a environment that can bring them sub-health."	I_S0
"TV,snakes,mobile phone and air-condition,these things are the young people cannot leave."	I_S0
"Interesting films,funny games and delicious snakes let them ignore thire bodys,they enjoy them."	I_S0
"When we build some sports facilities,will they care about that?"	I_S0
"No,they won't."	I_S0
"Because they doesn't aware their bodys are in danger."	I_S0
"In another words,the right way we should do is not increase mor facilities."	I_S0
"We must let them aware that they must be active."	E_S0
"All in all,we should let young generation know they must be focus on thire health."	B_C1
"Because that is the only one way can encourage them."	E_C1
 
"Whether the New Railway Lines is Neccessary"	S_S2
"In these days, on the one hand, it is believed that bulding new railway line is requisite for the fast trains betweent cities."	B_I0
"On the other hand, people think thre funds of the government should be used for enhancing the in being public transportation."	E_I0
"From  my perspective, the new railway lines are more needful."	S_T1
"The new railway routes could be bulit in the area that contains infant industies or businesses."	S_M0
"Mainly because when the transportation there developed."	B_S0
"There will be more investments for the businessess."	I_S0
"What is more is that it will also increase the employment for the places that set the new railway routes."	I_S0
"Not only the daily life of people become more convenient, but also the communication between regions become better."	E_S0
"However, if the government set more new railway line, they may not have more funds to enhance the existing public transport which is also significant for a country."	S_M0
"As there will be people from pther countries travel here."	B_S0
"The environment and property of the public transport is the face of a country."	I_S0
"The bad environment or property may give them a bad impression."	I_S0
"Therefore the reputation will be influnced."	E_S0
"To summarize,although it is also needed to improve the existing public transport,compared this with constrcting new railways routes."	S_M0
"The second one may be more curcial now."	B_S0
"Because it could boost the ecnomic growth of the country."	I_S0
"Only the country grows up and becomes strong."	I_S0
"They have the time and energy to improve the property."	I_S0

"Pterosaurs were a kind of winged reptiles."	S_I0
"People have some disscution about wheather it can fly or not."	S_T1
"Firstly, the author in the passage point out that modern reptiles always be cold-blooded."	S_M0
"Since there is no cool-blooded animals can fly, pterosaurs were able only to glide."	B_S0
"However, the descovery of pterosaurs shows that it contains hair or fure which used to keep warm."	I_S0
"This covering was used by warm-blooded animals since cold-blooded animals donnot deed to keep warm."	I_S0
"In this way, it can provide the energy that used fly."	E_S0
"Secondly, the passage mentios that there is a limit to the weight of animals that can be kept airbone by powered flight."	S_M0
"While the porfessor in the lecture diasgree the opinion and sites the fact that it cannot determine the weight by only considering the size of the bone."	B_S0
"The bone may be unusually light as the bone is hollow."	I_S0
"in this way, the weight of pterosaurs is relativly low."	E_S0
"Thirdly, the reading materials believes that pterosaurs donnot have the force to rub fast or jump high enough to launch thesleves into the air as their back legs were too small and weak."	S_M0
"However, the professor disagree with the idea and mentions that pterosaurs are not birds which only use two legs."	B_S1
"Since it had four legs to support the force needed to jump high enough to launch."	E_S1
 
"Currently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate: which one is better for people, following their dreams even if the dream are ambitious or focusing on achieving realistic goals."	B_T1
"Opinions vary from people to people."	I_T1
"Some claims that people should follow their dreams even if the dream are ambitious, since such dreams means a unprecedented success which have not been exploited and it is more likely for people to success."	E_T1
"However, I hold an opposite view that people should concentrate on achieving realistic goals, because it is easier for us to success and perservance."	S_T0
"First off, the realistic goals means there are more experience and cases we can take to ensure our success."	S_M1
"To illustrate, when achieving realistic, even if we confront with some thorny problems, we can ask some predecessors for help, which can help us to overcome these problem more quickly and effciently."	B_S0
"In this case, our ultimate success can be guaranteed."	I_S0
"By contrast, when people persue the ambitious dream, there are usually no predeccessors."	I_S0
"When they face the unsettled problems, they have to struggle with it by their own and they even don't have people who understand their depression."	I_S0
"For instance, My professor MS. Zhang sparses no effort on resolving the problem of the technology of restoring electricity tremendously, which is thought to be extremely hard and ambitious."	I_S0
"Besides, he had no coworker or students who work in the same field as him, which made him feel very lonely and isolated from the society."	E_S0
"Additionally, the realistic goals is easier to perservance."	S_M1
"To elaborate, when we chase the realistic goal, we can perview the result of each section."	B_S0
"After complete each part of our schedule, we can get a great sense of satisfaction."	I_S0
"Under this circumstance, we are encouraged to complete the whole goal."	I_S0
"By contrast."	I_S0
"the ambious dreams means that the result is uncertain and unclear."	I_S0
"Therefore, in the long process of pursuing their dreams, time will gradually gnaw away their ambition."	I_S0
"For instance."	I_S0
"my cousin dreaming of earning 1 million dollors when he was 30 years old."	I_S0
"Such abitious goal make him live a hectic life."	I_S0
"Since this dream is far-touching, he suffers from a lots of failture which makes him lose their confidence and  long time failure make him overwhelmed by depression, anxiety and even insomnia."	I_S0
"Eventually he decided to give up."	E_S0
"To put it in a nutshell."	S_C2
"It is more beneficial for people to pursue the realistic goal step by step, since relistic goal can guarantee our final success and perser"	O
 
"What is given is a flow chart illustrates the life cycles of a creatures of huge fish called the aslmon,which can be divided into 3 stages."	S_I0
"In the first stages,salmon begin life as eggs  hidden in the reeds with small stones and slow moving upper reaches of a river."	S_M0
"After five to six months the eggs become fry."	B_S0
"For approximately the next 4 years,the fry will live in the lower and faster flowing water of rivers."	I_S0
"During this period they measure between 3-8cm in length."	E_S0
"The second step shows that the fry reach 12-15cm they are called  'smolt' and  at this time they live in open sea."	B_M0
"At the last stage,after 5 years the 'smolt' will have grown to adult size,which is between 70-76cm."	E_M0
"They begin swimming back to their birthplace,where they will lay their eggs,and the life cycle are started."	S_S2
"In conclusion,the salmon passes through 3 steps as it grows."	B_C0
"Each of stages takes place in a very different location."	I_C0
"The first and second steps of fish's life in a freashwater,while the third stages is lived in saltwater."	E_C0
 
"It is still a question that if bees existed 200 million years ago."	B_I0
"Although now we found very old fossil structures that resemble bee nests and the structures have been found inside 200-million-year-old fossilized trees."	E_I0
"Some people still doubt with that."	S_T1
"They have pointed out some questions for this discovery."	S_M1
"But other people find explanation for that things."	B_S0
"For example, to begin with, they have pointed out that there is no fossil of actual bee date to 200 million years ago."	I_S0
"The earliest preserved body of a bee is 100 million years old."	I_S0
"However, some experts point out that at that time the bees could not be preserved because if a bee was preserved, it would need special sticky things to preserve."	I_S0
"But at that time, these trees were uncommon."	I_S0
"So there is no fossil."	E_S0
"Then, these people also point out that there was no flowering plants at that time because the earliest flowering plants were 125 million years ago to now."	S_M1
"However, experts have pointed out that at that era, the bees might feed on other non-flowering plants."	B_S1
"And then, as the apperance of the flowering plants, they then fed on them."	E_S1
"In addition, these people doubt that the structure of the bees' nest lack of some details."	B_C0
"For example, the chambers of modern bee nests are closed by caps that have a spiral pattern, but the fossilized chambers lack of such caps."	I_C0
"So, the nests might be produced by other insects but not the bees."	I_C0
"However, the experts also point out that also that thing lack of some details, we still have enough evidence to proof that the nests were made by bees."	E_C0
"For instance, we have the chemical evidence."	B_S0
"As we know, the bees will use a kind of special water-proof substances to build their nests."	I_S0
"It is also true for the fossils."	I_S0
"So we have enough evidence to proof that the nests were made by the bees."	E_S0
 
"From my perspective,countries are becoming more and more similar because people are able to buy the same products anywhere in the world is a positive development."	S_I0
"Here're my two main reasons."	S_T1
"Initially,it shows that the world becomes a small villege."	S_M1
"The distance between people from different countries becomes closer."	B_S0
"Thanks to the development of economy and transportation,people can buy import products easily and conviniently."	I_S0
"For instance,if I live in China,I can also enjoy Japanese sushi by walking downstairs,get into a supermarket to buy them,which is super convinient."	E_S0
"Secondly,I believe that every country has its own spectacular product,the quality of them is so perfect that any other product couldn't replace them."	S_M1
"For example,Germany are good at car's design and construction."	B_S0
"The cars made in Germany have the highest quality,which can't be replaced by any other places in the world."	I_S0
"If people from another country can easilly buy the German cars,that's really a good thing."	E_S0
"People are able to buy the same products anywhere in the world is a win-win project for most of the countries in the world."	S_C2
"It's also the best way to increase the development of economy."	S_S2

"The biggest difference is at the skilled vocational diploma which is the  lowest post-school level in the list, in which 90% of those who held a skilled vocational diploma were
men, compared with only 10% of women."	B_S0
"By contrast, more women held undergraduate diplomas( 70%) and     women reached at the degree of 55% in bachelor's degree."	I_S0
"Women play a significant rolr in these levels."	E_S0
"At the higher levels of education , men with postgraduate diplomas clearly outnumbered their female numbers (70%and30%,respectively), and the percantage  of Master's graduates for males is up to 60%."	S_M1
"In conclusion, we can see that more men than women hold qualifications at the lower andhigher levels of education, while more women reach undergraduate diploma level
than men."	B_S1

"Those who in senior management positions to have much higher salaries than other worker,I think some times it is a good thing ."	S_T1
"Beacuse the one who have a higher salaries must have interest in studying, without this they could't have much higher salaries."	B_S0
"And from this we can know they also have ability in study, thus the one who have the much salariess must read many books about their subject and they can easy hand some problems."	I_S0
"When they were having their study , they make their own choice and the way they deal with thing will be much more mature."	I_S0
"From the other side ,the one who don't have a  high salaties, spend less time in study their subject ."	I_S0
"And some company like HUA WEI ,they don't have a worker with low salaries, because they study science, they need the high IQ worker ,and the worker who read more books in their own subject, that will help the company be strong."	I_S0
"the company going well , the worker will a good environment for worker."	I_S0
"And  the senior management positions not only due to one's higher salaries, but the higher salaries most in senior management positions,that  can show a reasult ,those who have higher salaries can do things well."	I_S0

"Students nowadays have many skills to learn to ensure that they can make their living."	E_I0
"Besides the courses of necessary skills, I believe that history courses should be taken by all university students regardless of their major."	S_T0
"First of all, by learning the history of their countries, they can gain confidence on their society and are more likely to be devoted to work after they graduate."	S_M1
"Supposing two students major in math, one takes a history lesson about the development of his country, while the other lacks the lesson."	B_S0
"When learning about the hard work people in the past have done to develop the country, the former students are likely to get touched, thus he might know what to do for the country."	I_S0
"With such target in mind, he will work harder on his major and are probably doing better than the latter students."	I_S0
"Taking history courses gives students inner power which is not only good for them, but also benifit to our society."	E_S0
"Besides, by learning the history of their major, students are more likely to ensure their future directions in their major."	S_M1
"For example, if a student learing math takes the course talking about the history of math as well as the development of it."	B_S0
"He will learn about the way how people in the past develop and learn math."	I_S0

"It is true that there are more and more advertisements appear and the influence of them is very significant."	B_I0
"Some people think that the phenomenon that people are willing to purchase some products which have appealing advertising but not really need results in the high sales of those products."	E_I0
"In my opinion,i partly agree with that."	S_T0
"On the one hand,it is no doubt that some people would buy goods because of the advertising."	S_M1
"Firstly,some companies would choose famous celebrities as their spokesman of goods and shoot product advertising."	B_S0

"Secondly,some of advertisements are very lively and convincing so that some people are attracted by them and buy them because they want to try it even they do not really need."	E_S0
"On the other hand,to some extent,the main reason of many high sales of popular consumer goods is not the power of advertising."	S_M1
"Firstly,many people purchase goods because they are useful and necessary."	B_S0
"For example,most popular consumer goods are daily necessities."	I_S0
"It is incorrect to say people buy those goods because they have fancy advertising but not the real needs of society."	I_S0
"Secondly,most people have ability to think and analyse which advertisements are real and have rational view of advertising contents."	I_S0
"So they do not buy goods blindly just because of beautiful advertising."	E_S0
"In conclusion,although a part of advertisements contribute to the high sales of some popular products,i would argue that the main reason of most popular goods is the functions of those products are useful and necessary."	S_C2

"When you have a sense of competition,you will work hard,trying to develop your skills to achieve your dream."	I_S0

"However,opposite side also gives out reasons."	I_S0
"Trying to cooperatr with others while gettong troubles is also a necessary skill."	I_S0
"Some times cooperating with others could spend less time but accomplish a harder problems."	I_S0
"For instance,while dealing in a big company,if the staff there just do their individual things,the company will be closed soon."	I_S0
"So they need to cooperate with others and get the defined jobs,so that a company can run well."	I_S0
"Therefore,many people deem that cooperation is better."	I_S0
"According what these two ideas,we can see both of them are reasonable and justified."	I_S0
"For my part,children have to know the importance of cooperation and competition."	I_S0
"So they should be equiped by them at the same time if they want to achieve success."	E_S0

"I am quite honored to have the chance to state my opinion."	S_T0
"Initially,i have to put forward my thought that i think this is a good idea."	S_T1
"The reason goes as follows:"	S_S2
"First and foremost,in China,as a result of our heavy study, it is kind of difficult to have some spare time to earn our extra money,so in my opinion it is a good way that can provide us students with money."	S_M0
"Next,offering money when we have a good grade is quite an effective way to keep up our study enthusiasm and it is a way to show us that only if we make some progress will we be praised and highly appreciated."	B_S0
"Then,for those students who do not want to learn, it is also an exceedingly fantastic way to arouse their interest in learning."	I_S0
"Last but not least ,we students do not know much about our social,learning is a kind of way to make us know more about the fabulous world."	E_S0
"As far as i know,in American,some parents will pay for the students if they do some housework."	S_M0
"I think they are similar in some way."	B_S0

"Take my elder sister Stella as an example, she is now 22 years old."	I_S0
"She told me that when she was 14 years old, it was so simple for her to remember a long poem."	I_S0
"And now, she should spend 1 hour, for reading, writing and memorizing constantly, but after one-night-sleep, she forgets it."	I_S0
"Children spend most of their youth and the easiest time to learn new knowledge at school, that is the first reason that they are influenced more outside their home."	E_S0
"They spend more time at school, interacting with teachers and classmates."	S_M1
"There is a research about students, the first group of them spend more time at school with their teachers and classmates, and the other group of them stay with their family for the most of time."	B_S0

"in some countries, high-speed rail is welcomed by many people because it can carry passengers between a shorted period of time."	S_I0
"some think the government should allocate a large sum of money into such railway lines, while others believe that the money should go to existing public transport."	S_T1
"supports of building high-speed rail argue that new railway lines should help save time despite the massive investment."	S_M1
"with urban areas expanding further, more people may live in suburbs or even live in neighboring cities, and this means a new railway line between cities is especially important for those who need to travel to and from city center for work."	B_S0
"if there were not such high-speed rail, it is impossible for many people living rural areas to commute in and out of the city every day."	I_S0
"Therefore, a significant investment in the construction of high-speed railway lines is justified."	E_S0
"However, there are also some opponents against such investments."	S_M1
"myself included and they think the funds should go to public transportation."	B_S1
"one major reason is that they are expensive and most of the current funds could be used to improve the public transport, including buses and underground trains."	E_S1
"in conclusion, i believe that although there are benefits living outside the city if high-speed trains are developed, the rural population is relatively low and existing public transport is still the main choice for most of population and should be the priority of the investment."	S_C2

"The passage thinks that salvage logging is good both for the forest and the economy."	S_I0
"However,the professor totally disagrees with the viewpoint that pointed out by the passage."	S_T1
"First,the passage consider that salvage logging can remove the dead trees and provide the space to the new trees to grow up quickly,which can make forest recover from the disater fast."	S_M0
"On the contrary,the professor says that it is a bad idea beacause salvage logging takes away the nutrients that new trees need in the future,since dead trees can give the nutrient to the soil after they decomposed."	S_S2
"Second,the reading mentions that harmful insects like the spruce bark beetle are easily to settled in the dead trees and spruce bark beetle can destroy the forest."	S_M0
"However,the professor argues that thereis no evidence for spruce bark beetle that cause extermely damage to the forest."	B_S1
"Some insects and birds that inhabit dead trees are beneficial for tree growth,and a few that are thought to be harmful."	E_S1
"Finally,the reading states that salvage logging provides many factories with the wood necessary to sustain their production and offer employment opportunities to local people."	S_M0
"On the other hand,the professor against salvage logging because the dead trees can only be salvaged at a very high cost,and the salvage logging does not last too long,which is usually completed by other companies not the locacl people."	S_S2
 
"As the passion of fans of celebrities is becoming more and more nowadays, a larger number of people are curious about the lives of celebrities they like."	S_I0
"Nevertheless, some opponents would argue that famous entertainers or athletes should obtain their own privacy."	S_T1
"From my perspective, I agree with this idea."	S_T0
"To begin with, sufficient privacy could be protective to celebrities and their families."	S_M1
"If the privacy of singers or a movie stars is exposed to the public too much, they may become more dangerous and easy to be hurt, because more people will know their accomodations and it is easy for those people who hate them due to the jealousy of reputation, high salary, or something else to find their locations and hurt them."	B_S0
"Although the fans of Justin Bieber, a well-known singer from Canada, are not likely to hurt him, some people who have learned about his some bad and negative history may hate him."	I_S0
"I read a news that when Justin was relatively young, he became famous and earned a high salary."	I_S0
"However, he was influenced by someone and used his money to have drugs, and although he admitted that thing and apologized to the public after he grew up, some people still could not forgive him and foud his house and destroyed it."	I_S0
"The exposure of Justin's house did a harmful impact on him."	E_S0
"Additionally, the lives of celebrities may be full of intervention without enough privacy."	S_M1
"Since fans can know about their daily schedules, there are always people following them whatever they do, and this influences their lives much."	B_S0
"Imagine that you are a famous singer and are ready to date with your lover, but this information has been exposed to your fans."	I_S0
"Ad a result, many people will come to the restaurant where you have dinner and you cannot have a tranquil environment with  your lover."	E_S0
"In conclusion, I would say that it is an disadvantageous idea of exposing the privacy of celebri"	O
 
"In recent years, an increasing number of citizens pay attention to the condition of transportation systems, which play an important role in developing the countries."	S_T1
"Some individuals believe building new railway lines is the best way to achieve it, while others argues that improving exisiting public transport is also necessary for countries."	B_S0
"In my opinion, it is not enough just constructing new transportation."	I_S0
"As for the advocates of investing money to build high-speed railway lines between metropolices, they hold the opinoin that it is more effective to accerlerate the development of a country."	I_S0
"Hign-speed trains could give countries an edge in exchanging their resources among cities in a wider range with a higher effeciency, for example, no matter the cargos or human resources could flow into those adjcent cities within hours."	I_S0
"However, it is true that those fast trains do play some part in accerlerating the speed of a country, but I believe,  it is far from enough to develop a country as a whole."	I_S0
"Some individuals, on the other hand, believe a large amount of money are expected to be spent on enhancing the exisiting public transport, which always is, and will remain, essential for the development of a country."	I_S0
"There is no doubt that an advanced public transportation system is able to facilitate a country to a large degree."	I_S0
"Based on the fact that there are a majority of citizens living in the inner parts of cities and don't need to commute between different cities frequently, so one of the most fundemental keys to developing a country is attaching much more importance to the existing public transport."	I_S0
"And the fast trains among cities could hardly serve these functions."	I_S0
"In conclusion, constructing new railway lines and improving public transport are not mutually exclusive, and there are advantages to both methods which could maximise the benefits."	E_S0

"This is a good idea."	E_T0
"First, studying is a very important skill, so kids mustget this skill."	S_M2
"It can help kids overcome many barriers at future."	B_S0
"Because this world is growing, and they get many important informations by study."	I_S0
"They wil not be left behind."	I_S0
"This is a fact, everyone could not escape."	E_S0

"Although, there are so many benefits if we take economic progress as first,I have to aruge that the other types of progress are also as important as that."	S_M1
"As a human money is not the only thing that we should chasing for a life, cause money can not bring us health ,friendshp, or even love ."	B_S0
"So ,it is necessary for a country to develope some other sides."	I_S0
"for example, the basic healthy equipments."	I_S0
"Nowdays ,with the increasing of pressure ,it is easy for our teengers to get illness,not only physical ,but also mental, to solve this ,the government should make progress on the medical service and health care."	I_S0

"The amelioration of technology brings us an issued that whether or not the old  keep learning up with the Times pales in importance to younger people."	B_T1
"Though i cannot completed deny the old's learning ability seems hard to receive new things, however some certain modern technique should be obatined by almost social members to make sure every single unit runs well in our life."	E_T1
"Initially, one reason makes my choice justifiable is the new system of payment through Zhifubao or Wechat."	S_M1
"A main payment approach in general places, such as  market, tax and online event."	B_S0
"It is far away from nothing but a huge revolution over social lifeway, which becomes an essential part of people's life, even among the old as well."	I_S0
"And the best way to know this is via learning."	I_S0
"Modern technology  develop  radically."	I_S0
"Everyone specially the old should keep pace with it to make everything easier rather than being like weirdo."	I_S0
"However if society runs without such functions, how it becomes such convenient."	I_S0
"How can give money to their child anywhere anytime?"	I_S0
"How can they take urber or didi while facing traffic jam?"	I_S0
"How can they pay the bill rapidly when they wanna see online movie?"	I_S0
"Clearly the old obviously should evolve their skills, and without the opportunity to fulfill this, the old may maintain old fashion framework just not efficient."	E_S0

"The dam will open at day and closed at night  to control the river's access to power station."	B_S0
"At the day，the river will flow into the power station."	I_S0
"When a river passes through a generator, it causes the generator to run and thus generates current to be transmitted to the national grid."	I_S0
"In the evening, the water flowing to the power station flows back into the reservoir by pumping."	I_S0
"Under the power station, there is a low-level reservoir that keeps the water with  low level."	E_S0
 
"It is known that families are characteristics that they not only give themselves confidence, but also give children the development and rights of education."	S_I0

"School education and social experience have alot of impact on people."	S_M1
"Most obviously, school students and social personalities have more knowledge and parents, teachers and friends are also be able to learn about some proficient things in their own relationships."	S_S2
"However, This is indeed a certain impression for family education, and in the pursuit of knowledge, one person has to develop habits such as learning skills and lecture attention in school, which satisfies the requirements of the school."	S_M1
"But the common life in the family may be less than school life, because it is also a key that not a person feels bored, or that parents have time to stay with children."	B_S1
"If they need a counseling person, to help the child get enough learning skills."	E_S1
"In conclusion, I don't agree with the opinion that other factors affecting the family itself because the value of the family is large in itself and will almost bear a greater impact on the family themselves."	S_C2
 
"Now, it has a ceaseless discussion about how many things people can do it at a same time."	S_T1
"Some people think that just can do the few things, others think can do so many different things."	B_T0
"In this background, a new statement " People can do a lot of different things rather than do very few things very well.""	I_T0
"From my perspective, I don't agree this statement."	E_T0
"Here I have three statements to oppose this statement."	S_T1
"Firstly, time likes the water in the sponge."	S_M0
"It has a lot if you want to use it."	B_S0
"So at a same time, people also can do many things."	I_S0
"The statement just an excuse to hide the truth that they are lazy."	I_S0
"For example, in China a lot of students want to study abroad."	I_S0
"They must learn the formal class and prepare the standard testing at the same time."	I_S0
"But, a lost of Chinese student not only get good grades in the schoolwork, but also they have a high score about the standard testing."	I_S0
"Because they can do many things very well at the same time."	E_S0
"Secondly, it needs more steps to finish a task."	S_M0
"If a people don't has the ability about finishing more things at the same time, he/she will be eliminated by the society."	B_S0
"In fact, a very easy task, such as cooking, they need to do a lot of things in a short time."	I_S0
"Cleaning the ingredients for many dishes, cooking the dishes,adding the condiment and so on."	I_S0
"If they can't do them well at a short time, they can't be stand at the society."	E_S0
"Finally, if a people are just can do very few things well, they'll not want to learn how to do more things."	S_M0
"And the people can't be succeed if they just can do few things well."	B_S0
"Wei Yongkang, a very clever boy."	I_S0
"His grade is very fantastic, especially in physics."	I_S0
"When he was 13 years old, he went to the university to learn physics."	I_S0
"But when he was young, his parents just asked him to study, so he can't do a lot of things of taking care for himself, such as washing clothes and cooking."	I_S0
"When he as a graduate in the science academy of China, his poor life skills can't make him adapted to the method of researching, he just can go home."	E_S0
"So I disagree with the statement, because people need to learn how to do so many different things."	S_C2
 
"I do not think parents offering their school aged children money for their success in school is a  good idea."	S_T1
"I disagree it in many ways."	S_M0
"Above all, students should not be encouraged to study by being given money."	B_S0
"This is the worst choice of giving any rewards!"	I_S0
"This will give the students who are going to attend futher education a false signal : I do all this for money."	I_S0
"This is not good for both the society nor for themselves!"	E_S0
"For the society, this way of thinking means a part of the new generation working for not their dreams or the good for their country, but for money."	S_M0
"This may lead to many problems: difficult[no matter physical or mental] jobs will lack the people that are interested in it, so many subjects like microbiology and manufactering will be abandoned for no one will study or work on it."	B_S1
"This will lead to the decreace of the develop of the human technology, which is not a good thing."	E_S1
"As for person, it will make people lose heart."	S_M0
"They will find themselves lost because they do not know why they are here or what they should do, they only care about money after all , so they will easily find themselves inside a mist."	B_S1
"As we all can see, using money to encourage childrren is useles , and will only lead to more problems."	E_S1
"Reasearch shows that money encourgement does no good."	S_M0
"There was a research that gives us samples of using money to encourage people and the using  true hearts to encourage them instead: A large number of people is divided into 3 groups, each will sacrifice one week of their vacation to make more money for the company and for themselves."	B_S0
"Group one gets 20% increace on their sallery;group two gets an extra pizza every meal with a bottle of cola; and group three gets the boss‘s praise."	I_S0
"In the first 2 days , all of them reacted the same, all fully motivaded."	I_S0
"But by day 3,group one lost interest and became the worst behaving group."	I_S0
"Group 2 lost heart and went on vacation 2 days later."	I_S0
"Only group 3 got it till day 7."	E_S0
"From all above, we can see that money can do nothing but decrease peoples interest."	B_C0
"Money is indeed useful, but it can not do everything."	I_C0
"When it comes to encouragement, stick to praises for the deep of your heart."	I_C0
"Giving money will only give you the opposite."	E_C0
 
"Governments attach much importance to economy progress due to the increasingly keen competition among countries in the contemporary world."	S_I0
"Some people argue that economy is not the only issue to judge the achievement of a government."	S_T1
"From my perspective, besides to strengthen the economy, there are still other challenges the government should take their responbility."	B_S0
"It is true that the prosperity of economy plays an important role in the society."	I_S0
"For example, increasing economic industries create more employments for the citizens which is beneficial for them to reduce poverty and lead a stable life."	I_S0
"Additionally, economy is the foundation of other development."	I_S0
"The profits and taxes revenue of economy is essential to bring great range of investments for other public facilities such as the urban transport network and community schools."	I_S0
"Moreover, great economy helps a nation to win a powerful status in the world stage."	I_S0
"Thus, it is more possible for the country to speak out in some global issues and the sense of national pride will also rise among people."	I_S0
"However, the dissenters believe the function of the economy has been overvalued."	I_S0
"For the one thing, if the goverment only stick the aim of economy boosting but ignore the environmental pollution, side-effect will appearance."	I_S0
"The typical case occurred in London during the period of the industry reform."	I_S0
"The awful smoggy weather from the emission of factories and transportations resulted in some serious diseases."	I_S0
"In addition, besides the economy progress, other issues should also be taken into consideration."	I_S0
"For instance, integrated development needs advanced level of health care and education systems."	I_S0
"Plus, the government is also responsible for the security and well-being of their citizens by controlling armed forces and imposing the laws."	I_S0
"As far as I am concerned, it is not easy to determine the successful government only for the level of economy."	I_S0
"Its performance and efforts in other projects which related to the public livelihood are also significant factors for the admired authority."	E_S0
 
"It is sometimes argued that many language which die out is not significant because people can just learn fewer languages to communicate with others."	S_T1
"Personally speaking, I do not agree with them."	S_T0
"It is true that if many languages die out and there are fewer surviving languages in the world, people can communicate with others more conveniently."	S_M1
"People from different areas can have a talk fluently because they  speak in the same languages."	B_S0
"As a result it can promote the development of the globle business and the cultural fusion."	I_S0
"What is more if people all over the world should just learn these survivors, they can spend more time and energy on their business and study rather than learn foreign languages and worry about that the teammates or partner speaking in different languages can not understand their opinions."	E_S0
"However,I believe that it is very important to preserve the languages which are in danger."	S_M1
"First, although people can translate different languages, fewer people could claim that they have such an ability that  they can translate every words arrurately because there are always a bunch of special words in a kind of language, which are hardly to find words that have same meaning in another language."	B_S0
"Besides there is no doubt that language is a symbol of culture for reason that people can just use local language to describe the local culture  precisely."	I_S0
"And 
 although the fact is that people forget many languages forever we need to protect every kind of language in the world because they are rare treasure of every person."	E_S0
"In conclusion, every language is important and they stand for the wisdom of the forefathers."	B_C1
"As a result ,we should respect and protect languages no matter whether there are many people using them nowadays.,"	E_C1
 
"As a result of constant media attention, sports professionals in my country have become stars and celebrities, and those at the top are paid huge salaries."	S_I0
"Just like movie stars, they live extravagant lifestyles with huge houses and cars."	S_T1
"Many people find their rewards unfair, especially when comparing these super salaries wth those of top surgeons or research scientists, or even leading politicians who have the responsibility of governing the country."	S_M2
"However, sports salaries are not determined by considering the contribution to society a person makes, or the level of responsibility he or she holds."	B_S0
"Instead, they reflect the public popularity of sport in general and the level of public support that successful stars can generate."	I_S0
"So the notion of fairness is not the issue."	E_S0
 
"As a indispensable part of our daily life,the medical technology is under a  high speed development with the great wave of scientific and technological innovation，contributing to the longer life expectancy."	S_I0
"But some people hold diverse opinion on the effect of the result about whether it is more advantageous."	S_T0
"I am supportive of the view that its merits exceed the demerit."	S_T1
"Admittedly the technolegy now is not so mature which means there is still a great many of unsatisfactory point ."	S_M1
"It is likely that some older people extend their lives by lying in bed and testing life characteristics and supplementing nutrition with intubation and machines which is actually suffering the pain."	B_S0
"And there is no doubt that when you get old, your physical function will decline."	I_S0
"After all, you can't expect the old to live as well as the young."	I_S0
"When you approach the end of live, your quality of life will be very poor and it seems unnecessary to prolong your life."	E_S0
"However I don't think extending life is just suffering,which should have a deeper meaning."	S_M1
"Thus,The longer life expectancy means you can have more time to accompany your family and friends ."	B_S0
"People are sentimental animals，therefore what people can't miss in the last time must be their most important people."	I_S0
"The extra months will be enough for them to remember the face of the person they miss in the warmest corner of the heart."	I_S0
"There also plenty of people nowadays leaving the world with unfinished wishes and regrets,like a lifetime of research."	I_S0
"If there were a few more months, they might be able to complete their unfinished regrets."	I_S0
"If not ,at less they can leave the world more leisurely."	I_S0
"Comparing to these,does the inconvenience really matters?"	E_S0
"To sum up,it's great to be able to extend your life with modern medical technology."	S_C2
 
"Are our kids becoming lazier and less creative, less imaginable than before as a conquence of highly advanced technology?"	S_I0
"My oppinion is no, and just the opposite, technology has apparently assisted our kids to become more creative."	S_T1
"Firstly, technology has provided children with easy access to scientific and liberal art resources which is their best source of inspiration."	S_M1
"For example, children could now easily gain access to academic databases through the screens of the electronic productions, read classical famous work on the Kindle, or whact historic videoss on many video applications."	B_S0
"However, these wonderful equipments and facilities are never as handy in the past, when kids could only reach limited recources in public labraries or schools."	I_S0
"In this sense, technology has provided the possibility for children to be more creative."	E_S0
"Second, technology equipped children with professional apparatus which vould finally realize their imagination."	S_M1

"There is a hot topic about the museums should be free or not on the internet."	S_T1
"It is no doubt that a lot of museums charge for admission."	B_T0
"However, in spite of those who think that should be no free, I hold opposite attitude."	E_T0
"Some people think the cities' museums almost support by local government, this money usually comes from taxes paid by citizens."	S_M0
"So we do not pay extra fee to enter the museum."	B_S0
"In addition, the purpose of a museum is for people to see, not for profit."	I_S0
"And it is a significant part for city citizens to expand the horizon, the government should support more people to go to museums."	E_S0
"In china, there is a famous museum and it could be a travel area as well."	S_M0

"Because The Forbidden City only charging a fee which goes to daily maintenance and administration costs."	E_S0
"I reckon it is a common phenomenon that each museums need to pay some money to enter, and in china, almost every museum charges a fee."	S_M0
"Firstly, it needs a large space to build."	B_S0
"Next, the museum needs some decorations and lights."	I_S0
"Then, many security systems need to be configured."	I_S0
"That by charging admission, the museum could earn back money to the fee they need and not rely on the money that government support."	E_S0
"In essence, there is nothing wrong with that a lot of museums charge for admission."	B_C1
"After all, the museums preserve our knowledge that may our book have not."	E_C1
 
"Owing to the rapid development of economy, people can enjoy a better life with less cost."	S_T1
"However, the appalling fact is that other aspects in our daily life seem getting worse, such as the environmental damage, which arouse public attention to what is the essential thing that our government needs to improve."	B_S0
"In my view, I regard the economic growth should be considered primarily."	I_S0
"It is reasonsable for government to believe that economy is the most important factor in our country."	I_S0
"Chairman Mao ever said that,  China's major focus is on socio-economic development and continued improvement of people's livelihood."	I_S0
"As we all know, the more developed in economy, the higher productivity a country has."	I_S0
"What's more, people who live in an wealthy country are more likely to devote themselves to work than citizens who are worried about their basic foods and houses."	I_S0
"With people's hard working, the economy environment has a bright future, which forms a virtuous cycle."	I_S0
"However, others can easily find two counter-arguments to support that other kinds of improvements should be put in dominative status in government's plan."	I_S0
"Admittedly,as the increase of economy, some environmental problems are emerging."	I_S0
"Overusing of land causes the deforestation which has detrimental effect on  agriculture and habitat."	I_S0
"Besides,there are ample evidence showing that wierd climate changes happened in these years are direct consequence of enviromental issues."	I_S0

"From my perspective,it is a beneficial way to improve public health by increasing the number of sports facilities."	S_I0
"But there are also a great deal of other ways to improve public health,especially the ideology level."	S_T0
"First of all, the more facilities in cities, the more opportunities people will do physical exercises."	S_M1
"I don't think that increase the number of sports facilities will just have little effect."	B_S0
"People don't have physical training largely because of the lack of convenient sports infrastructure."	I_S0
"For instance, my uncle likes to drink alcohol and he barely do any sports."	I_S0
"So that he died last year."	I_S0
"There aren't any sports facilities near by his home as far as I know."	I_S0
"My grandparents lived near a park and they often go there do exercises, as a result they left by the age of nineties."	I_S0

"Some people disagree that because they suppose it is an unnessary behaviour."	S_T1
"Personally, I think their view is rash."	B_S0
"Firstly, taking one year off is good for students who are in porverty."	I_S0
"During this period, they have enough time to riase money so that they have the ability of paying the scholl fee."	I_S0
"Not all of people live in a relative rich family."	I_S0
"Therefore, students take one year off is an inteliiget choice."	I_S0
"Secondaly, taking one year off benefits students to expand their social skills."	I_S0
"As usaul, schools just provide an atmosphere of aquiring knowelegy and they more attention on students' acadamic skills rather than their experience skills."	I_S0
"However, the one year between students finish school and go to the university is a good opportunite to expand their social skills."	I_S0
"For instance, people can know how to create their band account by experience a lobby maneger."	I_S0
"So taking one yaer off is essensial for students."	I_S0
"Finally, although students do not to use the year to travelor work, they also need to face that after they graduate from the university."	I_S0
"Taking one year off could make they more suitable for the fast-past life in the future."	E_S0

"Opinions are vary from person to person, some people claims that they actually get the as much salary as doctors, lawyers or bussiness leaders are gotten."	I_I0
"However, I would stand on the opposite side."	E_I0
"I believe that they could have diffenert number of salary."	S_T0
"Firstly, a business leader should be paid more than others because they would mak more contributions to the soecity."	S_M1
"Because the business leader offers many people job, which can support many families."	B_S0

"First,giving money as a reward will makes children feel the love of the family."	S_M1
"how to reward a children with good grades is a big problem for a lot of families."	B_S0
"But if you give money as reward which is similiar to the scholarship in university, the problem will completely solved."	I_S0
"The children will feel the love of his family and will not feel upset for no rewards."	I_S0

"But finally,they choose to reaward her with the money which is the most useful things for her."	I_S0
"And my sister feel very proud when she talked about it with her roommates and friends,she felt that she has a very wonderful parents."	E_S0

"Accord to the reading passage,the author claims that there are three theories elaborating the reasons for decline of sea cows."	S_T1
"First of all,in the reading passage the author believes that over hunting by Sibrian for food is the major factor for the decrease of sea cows."	B_S0
"In contrast, the lecturer opposes this view and maintains that sea cows,a kind of animal with approximately ten tons,are tooenormousfor people to eat,and another contributor refuting the view in thereading is that the population of people was not substantial at that time ."	I_S0
"Futhermore, contrary to the statement in the reading passage that the extinction of sea cows is due to the fact that it is the quantity of kelp,regarded as the food resource of sea cows

"As I think，nowadays，there were more people leaving schools with negative thoughts on studing,it has three reasons."	S_T1
"Firstly, the education system is boring."	B_S0
"Teacher often gives lots of homework to students and ask them to recite the things in coursebook."	I_S0
"This is really boring and very uncreative to the students beacuse they're tolding to accept the knowledge instead of thinking by themselves."	I_S0
"Secondly,the teacher don't care about the health of the students,they just need the good grades of student to won the reward and improve wages."	I_S0
"The students fell this and then they may hate the teacher and they don't want to study hard."	I_S0
"Thirdly,the pressure put on the studnt is very hard,in China,they have two important examinations which related to whether they could enter a higher school or not."	I_S0
"So everyone will focus on the students which is in the year face to guaduate and need to take the examination."	I_S0
"If they fail to do really well in the exam,they may critised by parents and talk behind by neighboors."	I_S0

"from my perspective i agree with the latter view."	I_S0
"Personally, i think the latter view is more reasonable."	I_S0
"firstly, some information are too important and valued to be shared."	I_S0
"for instance, if a company share its trade secrets to competitors, the company may loss its key customers or reduce its market share and revenue."	I_S0
"so this sharing is absolutely harmful and unreasonable."	I_S0

"because without heavily regulation, some information such as the design of weapon can be share to the terrorists, which may cause the terrorist attack and thousnads people died."	I_S0
"this is detrimental to the peace of society."	I_S0
"finally, if some people do not want to share their information then it is a violation of their right."	I_S0
"However, the former one is also understandable."	I_S0
"firstly, sharing the information in secientific research, business and the academic world can promote the development in these fields."	I_S0
"the benefit of information sharing can be seen in today's social."	I_S0
"After stepping into the information age, the whole society is growing at an unprecedented rate, so some expests think this reason should be attributed to the information sharing, and they believe if can result the similar situations if we share information in these areas."	I_S0
"secondly, information sharing can be a method of supervision."	I_S0
"sharing the information of a company and in a scientitic research to others can make they believe there is no fraud in the process and the result of it is credible."	I_S0

"Nowadays，television has been popularized to every family,but some people think having more TV choices,while other people think too many TV channels only leads to lot of poor quality TV programs."	B_T1

"The advantage,peo ple can see more programs,understand more knowledge and information,and will not be boring."	B_S0
"For example,your family wants to watch a series,and you want to see a science fiction film,but when you don not, you are sure to be disappointed."	I_S0

"The reading made three points to show that salvage logging is beneficial for destructive forest and economy."	S_I0
"However, each of the points is disproved by the speaker in the listening."	S_T1
"Firstlly, the reading claims that salavage logging could remove dead trees and make more space for new trees growing after a damaged fire."	S_M1
"On the contrary, the lecturer argues that it is not necessary to remove place and dead trees could make soil more suitable for trees gernerations."	S_S2
"Secondly, the reading asserts that dead trees will make a suitable habitat for some insects which are harmful for forest such as spruce bark beetle."	S_M1
"If their population expand, the forest will be damaged by insect infestation."	B_S1
"In contrast, the speaker states that dead trees also provide suitable habitat for birds and other insects which are significant contributors for forests."	E_S1
"Third, the reading mentions that salvage logging is beneficial for economy since natural disasters provide woods for industry."	B_C0
"However, the lecturer points out that the benefit of salvage logging will not last very long."	I_C0

"Nowadays, many people are talking about how to make a good decisions."	B_I0
"Some people like to make a determination by themselves."	E_I0
"But the other prefer to depend on what their parents say."	B_T0
"But in my opinion, i think making decisions by myself is a better choice."	E_T0
"Admittedly, I have to say that depending on what people's parents say is a good point."	S_M0
"Since people's parents must be older than yound people so that parents are always experienceing much more things than the yound men do."	B_S0
"It's known that if one person has been though many things , he must be full of expeience."	I_S0
"In this case,parents will always have more knowledge so that depending on their parents is a good choice."	I_S0
"However, determining by yourself have more advantages."	E_S0
"Firstly,deciding by themselves can help people be independent  quickly."	S_M0
"Since all of people's determinations are from people's mind  so that whether or not people make a wrong or a correct decision,people can gain a lot of expericen."	B_S0
"If people get a lot of experience, people will get to think by themselves unavoidable."	I_S0
"For example, one of my friends start to decide by himself form a young age."	I_S0
"Now he can live by himself without concerning by his paretns."	E_S0
"Thirdly,deciding by themselves can make you fit the change in  the future."	S_M0
"if people get to determin by themselves."	B_S0
"They will start to get used to depend on themselves."	I_S0
"Since everyone knows the future will be uncertain."	I_S0
"So everything will change in the futur."	I_S0

"But debates continue on how should parents educate their child."	E_I0
"For some parents, it will be better to teach their child hand in hand thus they will not encounter some troubles."	S_T0
"But I insist that parents should let children exprience making mistakes and then learn from it."	B_T1
"Here are my reasons."	E_T1
"Children have to realize that things are not always going so well but keep going wrong and is then recorrected."	S_M0
"If parents do not let children make mistakes, they will intend to consider whatever they do simple."	B_S0
"And that is not good for their growing up, for they will be easily beaten in their later years."	I_S0
"My nephew is an apple in his parents eyes, thus he was protected too carefully."	I_S0
"While he was learning to walk, his parents always followed him and astisted."	I_S0

"Crying as loudly as he could, he just sited on the cold hard floor instead of getting up himself."	I_S0
"He just didn't expect the danger he was facing."	I_S0
"We can see that, children could be braver if parents let them make mistakes."	E_S0
"As children growing up, they will be more confident to solve problems if parents do so."	S_M0
"It is from these experiences of making mistakes and trying again that children gain a confidence that 'I can do it if I make efforts'."	B_S0
"And they are more likely to presist in one thing."	I_S0
"Let me raise an example of my own."	I_S0
"When I was at primary school, my math was poor."	I_S0
"I always turn to my father for help, who was a doctor in engineering."	I_S0

"But I did it finally."	I_S0
"Since then, I had the confidence of solving math problems."	I_S0
"My father's letting me go really helped me."	E_S0
"Admittedly, children may deroute if keeping making mistakes."	S_M0
"And parents help is important."	B_S0
"But parents can let them make mistakes and then asist them solving the problem."	I_S0
"So there will be no worries about those problems."	E_S0
"I believe that children can benefit from making mistakes and solving them."	S_C2
 
"It is becoming more popular in the recent decades for people to take up a new language."	S_T1
"While some people believe that the only reason behind this is that they want to travel to or find a decent job in a foreign country, opposers argue that there are reasons more than these."	B_S0
"There is no point in denying that numerous people study a foreign laguage simply because this makes more conveniece for them to travel and work."	I_S0
"During their travel and work, they are able to communicate better with local people, because they can express their wants and needs more accurately."	I_S0
"Additionally, it is a common requirement for the working class to understand more than their mother language which is a sign of being well-educated and ability."	I_S0
"And it is evident that foreign companies take these characteristics into consider while hiring overseas emploees."	I_S0
"Opponents; however, argue that it is not acceptable to take the mentioned two aims as the only reason for learning a new language."	I_S0
"In their opnions, learning a foreign language is one of the means to adapt to a new culture."	I_S0
"It is significance in most cultures that language is one of the aspects that displays a nation's folk-custom."	I_S0
"For example, most Chinese idioms were simplified from folktales or historical events."	I_S0
"Languge, therefore, help foreigers to understand Chinese culture."	I_S0

"As the development of the society, more and more people began to question the traditional lifestyle."	B_I0
"Some people still advocate the traditional lifestyle--- work five days a week for short hours because it has through the test of time; other people argue that work only three days a weekfor long hours is more effective."	E_I0
"However, I strongly believe that the traditional lifestyle is better, here are the reasons."	S_T0
"Firstly, working for longer hours may increase health problems, and illness of course makes people painful and less enjoyable."	S_M1
"Working for long hours may mean sleep later and get up earlier which against our biology clock."	B_S0
"There is an old chinese saying: get up early and go to sleep early makes a man healthy."	I_S0

"And my immune system became to be more feeble."	I_S0
"The study is like that and the work is of the same principle."	I_S0
"And without a good healtth, you almost cannot do anything!"	I_S0
"Anything you do is mysterable In conclusion, work five days a week for shorter time leads to a heathier life and makes people more effective."	E_S0
"Admittedly, working for longer hours can achieve longer recreation period."	S_M1
"But, we can also have a rest during summer and winter vovation!"	S_S2

"Recently, the sale of fossils has grown into a large business, and the private collectors have been selling and buying fossils a lot."	B_I0
"The reading says that this is an unfortunate development for both scientists and the general public, but the lecture argues that the advantages from this issue really outweigh the disadvantages."	E_I0
"Firstly, the reading asserts that the public may suffer from the reduction in the chances of seeing these fossils since they may be hided by the private collectors."	S_M1
"However, the lecture believes that the commertial fossil hunting may lead to an increase in the number of fossils, bringing a decrease in the price of fossils to the market."	B_S1
"Therefore, even the public institutions like the schools may be able to buy the fossils, meaning a possible greater exposure in fossils."	E_S1
"Secondly, the reading mentions that the scientists are likely to lose access to some of the important fossils and thereby miss out on potentially crucial discoveries about extinct life forms."	S_M1
"However, the lecture points out that the fossils are needed to be examined before it is given a value, meaning that the fossils all need to pass through the hands of scientists since they are the people who are going to identify the fossils, so they will not miss anything."	S_S2
"Thirdly, the reading says that the commercial fossil collectors may destroy the valuable scientific evidenced associated with the fossils they unearth."	B_C1
"However, the lecture argues that if there is not any of the commertial fossil hunters, many fossils will not be discovered."	E_C1

"In this essay, I shall explain why I think that it is a good idea for secondary school students to do compulsory community service."	O
"Life skill are very important and by doing voluntary work, students can learn how to communicate with others and work in a team but also how to manage their time and improve their organisational skills."	B_I0
"Other kinds of community service give students the chance to work with children or work on projects to improve the community."	E_I0
"All of these broaden horizons and demonstrate to students what their place in society is."	S_T1
"Many colleges and companies are also increasingly looking for this type of experience."	S_M1
"Most school leavers have the same grades and charitable works can help set you apart from the herd."	B_S0
"For example, Cambridge and Oxford receive thousands of applications from straight-A students every year and can only accept a small percentage of applicants."	I_S0
"What you have done outside the classroom is often the thing that differentiates you from everyone else and gets you that coveted spot."	E_S0
"In addition, many community services suffer from a lack of volunteers, so using secondary school students in this way provides enough people to meet this shortfall."	S_M1
"The supply of students is very likely to continue as older students leave school but new ones enter, so the provision of these community services is almost guaranteed."	S_S2
"In conclusion, teenagers should be made to partake in unpaid work as part of their schooling because it will help them learn things they wouldn’t ordinarily learn from their teachers and it will also boost their chances of getting into third level education."	S_C2
 
"Nowadays,more and more students give up their study and try to find a job at a really young age and usually, the reason why they do so is being anoyed or bored with study."	B_T1
"Such a phenomenon sets me think a lot."	E_T1
"As far as I'm concerned,the booming of internet should be a really strong force to this phenomenon."	B_S0
"Most students can know about the internet world easily,from which,they could find things much more attractive than study."	I_S0
"Take my friend as an example."	I_S0
"The first time he played computer games---LOL,he decided to be a proffesional player instead of a student."	I_S0
"He told me that games could give him the happiness that study never gave so he droped
from school and worked much harder to be a excellent player."	I_S0
"With internet,student have much more choices than before and they realize that study is not the only way to success."	I_S0
"However,no mater what we will do in the future,it is knowledge that makes us go to the right direction and study is where knowledge comes from."	I_S0
"To improve ths situation,I two simple advice."	I_S0
"First,the teaching method is eager to be changed."	I_S0
"In china,everyday,many schools encourage students do the same thing without creating,which can easily makes students anoyed with study so the government should make a revolution in teaching method."	I_S0
"what's more,parents should pay more attention to children's mind."	I_S0
"As the first teacher of child,parents need to help children form the mind that study is necessarry for everyon at any time."	I_S0

"The answer of this statement depends on own experience and life style."	B_I0
"In my point view, offering school-age children money for each high grade they get in school is a pretty good idea."	E_I0
"Among countless factors which influence the choice, there are three conspicuous aspects as follows."	S_T0
"The main reason for my propensity is that rewarding money is a good way to encourage children."	S_M1
"When children got terrible grades in last examination, they might lose interest in learning or feel unconfident to do a good job."	B_S1
"If their parents reward them by money, children are able to get double sense of achievement after having high grades."	E_S1
"Another reason can be seen by every one is that the idea can make a virtuous cycle."	S_M1
"After children get money, they will use it to do the things they like."	B_S0

"In morden society , the importance of education for young children is on the alert ."	S_T1
"some believe that punishment is imperative to help children to distinguish the right from the wrong ."	B_S0
"From my perspective ,some of the punishment is not the most suitable way to achieve this ."	I_S0
"To start with, it is punishment that brings about resentment , which makes it even more difficult to prevent children from going astray ."	I_S0
"With the fact that rebellious children easily become furious after punished , conflicts between parents and kids is likely to be deteritorated ."	I_S0
"In this circumstance, children are no longer willing to listen to their parents advice in peace , and then parents may punish them again  ,which contributes to a vicious circle ."	I_S0
"Children might even do horrible things on purpose to enrage their parents ."	I_S0
"However, suitable punishments are beneficial of correcting children's behavior ."	I_S0
"Labour , for instance , can be an effective way of preventing children from doing uncivilised behaviors, such as throwing their litters everywhere ."	I_S0
"Punishments of this kind are capable of raising the awareness of behaving properly since children will learn what are the consequences if having the inappropriate behavior through solving the trouble they caused by themselves ."	I_S0
"To sum up , whether punishment is an efficient way of teaching kids depends on the extent of it ."	I_S0
"Excessive punishment is detrimental for both children's mental health and relationship between family members ,while suitable punitive measures stop children erring from the right path ."	E_S0
 
"As the social developing,now more and more presents hvave the ablity and willing to give more money to their children, some of present choose to give money according to the grade their child get in school."	S_T1
"For myself ,i think this way might have some benefits it is still not a good way for children's education."	S_T0
"there are some seasons."	S_T1
"First the young school-age children don't have the ability to control the money and us e them wisely."	S_M1
"according my experisence."	B_S0
"most of children who get money from them parents just use the money to buy toys or games on steam."	I_S0
"some of toy the brought even is dangerous for children like toy guns."	I_S0
"some of the game they buy also have bad influence for education like violent."	I_S0
"I think that in this sutlition a little gift like a book or a camera is a better choise for these parents,so that they can control this kind of bad  influence."	E_S0
"second for some older children who can control money instead of waste them,give money acccording the mark also not a good idea."	S_M1
"After all,study is for these childrens future development."	B_S0
"lt is a kind of behavior benefit themselves."	I_S0
"If give money for their marks they might think study is just for earn money."	I_S0
"in short time they may have stronger study willing, but what wii happen if they become satisfied?"	I_S0
"my little cousin is a tur example,last year he want to have a computer very much."	I_S0
"so his parent told him if he can got a mark higher than 85  they wiil give him money,so he stuided very hard,and at last he achieved the goal and his parents also brought  the computer for him."	I_S0
"However after he achieve his dream he no longer have the willing to study hard and this year his mark reduced."	I_S0
"so use money as an encourage way of study is not wise for parents."	E_S0
"in my view that the better way parents give money to child is to according the thing the child help parents do like housework,this way can tell them the fact that only when you do something for others you can be paid ,and also the amount of money should be control to a reasonable limit to prevent student become wasteful."	S_C2
 
"Nowadays, a big proportion of people pay increasingly attention of painting and drawing and many 
high schools also make art a compulsory course."	S_T1
"However, there still many people think that art is 
not as important as other subjects and does not need to be set as a required course."	B_S0
"In my 
opinion, I disagree with it completely."	I_S0
"Firstly, drawing and painting can improve students' creativity and expand their thinking."	I_S0
"For 
instance, in my school, our teacher will will first introduce us to different kinds of paintings and 
concepts, such as Impressionism, romanticism and realism."	I_S0
"We should create our own paintings 
according to our own understanding and related to these theme."	I_S0
"This not only can improve our 
knowledge of Art, but also can exercise our creativity."	I_S0
"What’s more, if drawing and panting can add 
to students’ compulsory course, students will have more chances to exposure to different types of 
knowledge, that is also useful for their future when they enter in a university."	I_S0
"Furthermore, this can help students who have no painting skills to learn this skill and have more 
hobbies."	I_S0
"For example, If a student's dream is to become a designer, then painting skills are 
necessary."	I_S0
"Setting art as a required course can meet the needs of students in this respect, and it 
can also be a more diversified choice for students in the future."	I_S0
"However, setting art as a compulsory course means less time for other main courses, especially in 
high schools’ courses."	I_S0
"That's why many parents worry that they don't approve of art as a major."	I_S0
"However, on the whole, it is more important to cultivate children's interests and consider their 
future."	I_S0
"Overall, I think art subjects such as painting and drawing should be made compulsory for high 
school students and Chinese traditional high schools and parents should put down the bias that 
"art is an elective course”."	E_S0

"To begin with, the reading part indicates the agnostids may be free-swimming predators hunting smaller animals."	S_M0
"However, the listening totally disagrees with it."	B_S0
"Due to the evidence that this spieces have small eyes and some of them are even blind, they have no ability chasing after their prays, unless they have other acute senses."	I_S0
"What a shame that they have not had those features."	I_S0
"That is because only the predators which have large eyes can actually catch their food easily."	E_S0
"What comes next is the hypothesis of seafloor dwellers."	S_M0
"The writing says agnostids may have dwelled on the seafloor."	B_S0
"By contrast, they have  got the ability of moving fast and spread quickly to the other places."	I_S0
"That is impossible."	E_S0
"Last but not the least, the writer believes there is the possibility that agnotids were parasites, feeding on larger organisms."	S_M0
"But the narrater cotradicts with it, for most of the parasites have limited population while the agnotids have a large amount of groups."	B_S1
"Owing to the truth that a vast number of them will kill all of the animals so they can not be a large group."	E_S1
 
"The line graph compares the amount of energy consumption by fuel in the USA since 1980 with projections until 2030."	S_I0
"It is clear that the amount of the  most of the energy increased in each period."	S_M0
"Overall,a much larger amount of coal and natural gas  had accessed to 32 and 25 from 17 and 20."	S_S2
"For nuclaer,solar/wind and hydropower."	S_M0
"The figures of them were much lower,because they are all not more than 10,just around 3 to 7."	S_S2
"To sum up,the consuption for coal,natural gas,nuclear and solar in the future will not less
than their history."	S_M0
"In addition to hydropower's consumption."	S_S2
 
"As is presented in the reading, the Northern Hemisphere had been endured extremely cold temperature from 1300 to 1850, which is also called the Little Ice Age caused by Gulf Stream, volcanic eruptions and the amount of carbon dioxide."	B_I0
"However, the lecturer disagrees with those opinions."	I_I0
"The specific reasons are as follows:
First thing first, according to the reading, Gulf Stream may cause temperature to drop."	I_I0
"Owing to its warmer-water current, it may melt the glaciers to release cooler water into the Gulf Stream, which leaded Gulf Stream didn't warm as usual."	I_I0
"But what lecturer has said argues that Little Iced Age was a global period."	I_I0
"But the Gulf Stream only flow near the Northern Hemisphere, which can't support truth that Southern Hemisphere was also cold."	E_I0
"On top of that, the reading reveals that volcanic eruption may drop temperature in a global scale."	S_M1
"Because eruption made dark clouds made of ash that can block the sun light."	B_S0
"Nevertheless, the lecturer said a 1815's eruption in Asia was a super volcanic eruption that made that year without summer."	I_S0
"But it only lasted one year."	I_S0
"In other words, it can't endure several centuries."	E_S0
"Lastly, the author in the reading states that a disease named the Black Death may cause this period."	S_M1
"On account of the decreasing of population, the carbon dioxide we emitted became less."	B_S0
"But the lecturer argues that population grew back quickly and the Black Death ended quickly."	I_S0
"The population in 1415 had been as same as  the population before the Dark Death."	I_S0
"And the carbon dioxide had been increased."	E_S0
"All in all these statements are not true."	S_C2
 
"In recent years, with the process of globalization and economy, development has increasingly become the main objective of international competition."	S_I0
"Some people think that economic development is the most important, while others think that other types of development are equally important."	B_T0
"In my opinion, in some cases, economic development is the most important thing, but all-round development is the best way in the long run."	E_T0
"Some governments think that economic development is the most important thing."	S_M1
"I think this view only applies to countries with rich resources ."	B_S0
"When economic development is ranked first, other  types of development will give way to it, which will inevitably causes environmental damage caused by economic development."	I_S0
"If the countries still insist on economic development as the primary goal, regardless of the impact of other damages, then the damage caused by this method will be irreversible, such as in the plateau, and other areas, the excessive development of animal husbandry has led to land desertification."	I_S0
"So if a country wants to develop its economy first, it must first ensure the influence of factors such as environment."	E_S0
"Some people think that other types of progress should be considered in the development of a country."	S_M1
"I agree with the above points."	B_S0
"Comprehensive development is the primary factor of sustainable development."	I_S0
"When only one aspect is developed, the form of the country will be seriously distorted."	I_S0
"For example, in the early days of the founding of the people's Republic of China, heavy industry was emphasized, which led to the unstable production of agriculture and light industry, the shortage of food and daily necessities and other serious problems."	I_S0
"Comprehensive development is the healthy development of a country."	E_S0
"To sum up,both methods are acceptablethe."	B_C0
"and the best development state of a country depends on its national conditions."	I_C0
"Different methods are suitable for different countries, but generally speaking, comprehensive development is healthy and sustainable development."	E_C0
 
"In such a highly competitive society, people are paying an increase amount of attention to how to improve work efficency."	B_I0
"When it comes to the statements that students work together or students work alone is better to learn much more effectively."	I_I0
"People usually exhibit an air of uncertainty."	E_I0
"However, in my opinoin, I think that students work together can learn much more effectively than students alone on projects."	S_T1
"First of all, students work together can discuss with each other and help each other, when students meet some diffculties, they can talk about this trouble and solve this problem together."	S_M1
"This way can improve work efficiency and learn more experience."	B_S0
"For example, the teacher lets us to design a research and do this research."	I_S0
"The teacher says that we can form a team or alone do it."	I_S0
"I organize a group with other three classmates."	I_S0
"We have a clear division of labor."	I_S0
"When we suffer form some problems, we will get together  and talk about it and slove it."	I_S0
"We save a lot of time to do other things, such as design, write and print."	I_S0
"We only spend two days to do these work."	I_S0
"We are the fastest finish this project in my class."	E_S0
"Second,"	S_M1
"Judging from all the evidence offered, we may safely arrive at the conclusion that  students work together can learn much more effectively than students alone on projects."	S_C2
 
"Recently, a new is so hot in the internet, the famous entertainers Cai XuKun have mysterious relationship with his one of vans at Sanya."	B_I0
"Many people like know and find famous entertainers' privacy."	E_I0
"So we have question about famous entertainers whether or not need to have more privacy than they have now."	B_T0
"In my opinion, i would say agree this statement, and i also have many example and reasons to illustrate my point of view."	E_T0
"First, i think people all should have more their own privacy, and the secret is a part of life to people."	S_M1
"Because whatever the entertainers how famous and hot, he or she also is a normal people, he should have the normal rights like the normal people."	B_S0
"For example, i have a brother is a basketball player, and his name is James."	I_S0
"He always teach me how to play basketball when I am child."	I_S0
"Today, he talks with me about his life."	I_S0
"He think his life is bored, he dose not have hisself privacy."	I_S0
"All day have people want to know his information about his life, he think these people are too bad."	E_S0
"Second, a famous entertainer's privacy play a important role in his life."	S_M1
"If the entertainer's privacys are found by other people, it is bad to his fame, and he might be lost his own profession."	B_S0
"For example, i have a friend is Nico, he is a famous singer, but when he were found in Helens this bar with his new girlfriend that older than he."	I_S0
"His fame is terrible in everywhere."	I_S0
"Original, our school has many people is his vans, but when they gain this massage, they all hate he, because he is a good boy in everyone's heart, he never is a bad boy."	E_S0
"Finally, nobody want to listenning he sing"	O
 
"In this essay, I shall explain why I think that it is a good idea for secondary school students to do compulsory community service."	O
"The main reason that I believe this is that it provides secondary school students with wider knowledge about, and experience of, their community and society in general."	S_M0
"Some types of community service involve working with sick or disabled people, giving students the opportunity to help those who are less fortunate."	B_S0
"Other kinds of community service give students the chance to work with children or work on projects to improve the community."	I_S0
"All of these broaden horizons and demonstrate to students what their place in society is."	E_S0
"Another key advantage of community service for secondary school students is that it can provide them with some work experience."	S_M0
"This is particularly true in some sectors, such as health care, but I think that community service generally provides people with a work ethic which will obviously be helpful throughout their lives."	B_S1
"The fact that the work is unpaid might inspire some students to continue with community service even when it is not a compulsory part of their secondary school curriculum."	E_S1
"In addition, many community services suffer from a lack of volunteers, so using secondary school students in this way provides enough people to meet this shortfall."	S_M0
"The supply of students is very likely to continue as older students leave school but new ones enter, so the provision of these community services is almost guaranteed."	S_S2
"To conclude, I think having secondary school students do community service is an excellent idea."	S_C2
 
"As the development of our social and the increase in personal wealth so some people in our country think that the government have the responsibility to take charge of the public health care and education，But other people think it shouldn't be the governments to pay,it should be paid for by ourselves."	S_T0
"For the people who think that the government should pay for public health care and education think that We pay high taxes to the government so the government should do it,and the government pays the tuition fees and medical fees that could help families have the money to improve their lives."	S_M1
"And it can promote social development and that government can accumlate more money ."	S_S2
"Others who think they should pay for education and health care think that,the government should spend more more money on public resources."	S_M1
"Instead of spend money on personal health and education."	B_S1
"If government spend much money on every people so the government should be poor and that is better for our social"	E_S1
 
"It's significant for us to figure out the debateable issue wether people should  fixed punishments for each type of crime or should be considered motivation for committing the crime."	B_T1
"Although many people have supporting both views, I insist that  people should  fixed punishments for each type of crime."	E_T1
"Taking the circumstances of a crime and its motivation into consideration is a prerequisite for establishing and ensuring justice and equity."	S_M1
"A person killing in self-defense cannot be compared to a serial killer, moving from one victim to the next."	S_S2
"Howerver, fixed punishments will have a diers effect on society."	S_M1
"Individuals knowing that they will be subject to a certain punishment if they are convicted with a given crime, will reconsider committing this act in the first place."	B_S0
"This deterring effect also leads to social stability and security, through minimizing the number of crime committed."	I_S0
"If people knew they would be able to convince the court or the jury of a reason for having committed the crime they are accused of, penal decisions would be largely arbitrary."	I_S0
"This would result into criminals getting away with their crimes and into a high level of injustice caused by the subjective approach of different courts."	I_S0
"An example for setting minimum and maximum penalties is Completion Law where a person being held liable of a crime under this law will be convicted to pay a fine, according to the harm caused by the violation and the profit gained by the violator through committing the crime."	I_S0
"As for the exemptions, in some countries the law exempts thiefs stealing food during a period of famine taking into consideration"	E_S0
"In my opinion,  to establish and ensure justice and equity, there have to be fixed punishments for all crimes."	B_C1
"If people fix punishments for each type of crime,  criminal laws will provide for a minimum and a maximum for the punishment and the laws also could foresee certain cases of exemptions."	E_C1
 
"In recent years the waste recycling has become one of the important issues affecting the sustainable development."	S_I0
"And arguments are divided on whether the government should establish legal regulation for better implementation of recycling."	B_T1
"Some experts, based on this background, have announced that legislation is reasonable and applicable."	E_T1
"On the one hand, the existence of legal requirement can facilitate the waste cycling on a whole-society scale."	S_M1
"The recycling rate will be greatly hightened with the improvement of citizen's awareness and the construction of corresponding infrastructure, which will contribute to reduction in energy consumption and economic prosperity."	B_S1
"People themselves will be definitely happy to see this and be benefited by the effect of economic growth."	E_S1
"On the other hand, if there is no related law to regulate people's behaviour, the level of waste recycling will never reach a satisfactory standard."	S_M1
"As known it takes time and effort for people to classify their wastes for recycle, and that's what most of them don't want to do because there seems to be no difference or direct profit which attracts them."	B_S1
"In other words, it is a common phenomenon that people who get used to throw their trash all together in one packet into one trash bin are not willing to do waste classification and recycling without the constraints coming from legal regulation."	E_S1
"To recap the topic, the popularization and implementation of waste recycling should be accompanied by necessary legislation to regulate people's waste behavior, which can not merely rely on their own awareness."	S_C2
 
"There is a number of people think that cultural traditions will be ruined if they are utilised as money-making machines which target at tourits, on the contrary, other people consider that there is no other way to save such conditons in the world."	S_T1
"People think that making cultural traditons financially attrative to the tourists will destroy the essence of them because it lose the authencity of the origin."	S_M1
"For example, many foreigners come to China to spend the lunar new year, because there are many celebrations and commercial activities during this period, when many department stores can gain a large amount of income."	B_S0
"However, the meaning of the spring festival is to allow family members to reunite together after a year-long hard work, to spend time with parents, friends."	I_S0
"The actions of some companies seem to destroy this atmosphere."	E_S0
"However, people who favor using cultural traditions claim that this practice not only protect them from becoming extinct but also allow toursits have a better understand of Chinese traditions."	S_M1
"We can see that many ancient temples are refurbished and are open to people all over the world, and the revenue can be used to better maintain the facilities and provide more services."	S_S2
"My view of point is that the best practice to save cultural tradtions is to use them, and making them more attractive to tourists ,since the more people understand them ,the better chance of survival these traditions will have."	S_C2
 
"Nowadays, we can see some news on media at times about people being less willing to help others than before."	B_T0
"Some people think that it's normal and we don't need to pay much attention."	I_T0
"But i  think people are indeed becoming less willing to help the struggling strangers."	E_T0
"The first reason is that the living pace in many cities are growing increasingly fast, which makes it more difficult for people to observe the things happened around them."	S_M1
"People are paying more attention to themselves so sometimes people just don't realize that some strangers are struggling and ned help."	B_S0
"We can see taht in many big cities like Beijing when people are on the way to work or home they hardly have attention on the people around them, instead they have to focus on their phones."	I_S0
"People almost don't know whether strangers need help or not!"	E_S0
"Secondly, there have been many news happened in China that the people who helped were cheated and wrongly accused of hurting the stranger."	S_M1
"These news make people dare not to help any more becaus epeople don't want there kind heart being cheated."	B_S0
"There has been a case that an old people slid down just by accident, a young man came to help and send the old people to the hospital."	I_S0
"However, the old people accused the young of knocking down him."	I_S0
"The news came out with a reslut that many people choose to just look and don'yt wanta to help when they see some people slide down and really need help."	E_S0
"However, although i state that people nowadays are less willing to help strangers, it doesn't mean that there are no people willing to help."	B_C0
"We xan still see many stories around us that some kind people even risk their life to save strangers when they face danger or in trouble."	I_C0
"And we need to do something to keep the bad trend from expanding."	I_C0
"In order to make more people willing to help, we can slow down the life pace, we can also construct a better law system to punish those who cheated the people helped them."	E_C0
 
"A hotly debated issue concerning whether passengers should pay a fee for the driver when there is a heavy traffic in busy city streets appears in our school newspaper."	B_I0
"During the discussion people hold different views."	E_I0
"In my opinion, however, it is ridiculous for passengers to pay the fee."	S_T0
"To begin with, Heavy traffic is not the passengers' fault, so they don't have to pay extra for it either."	S_M2
"Think about you are the passanger on the way home in some of a taxi, then the traffic became heavy ,that was so unlucky cause it would waste a lot of your time, and the most important thing is none of the passanger and the driver knew that would happen."	S_S2
"Next to this, lets think about this puzzle in another kind of situation, the driver wants the  passengers to pay for a compensation when the traffic is heavy, but that"	O

"I think theioneindicates Britain is transport system is becoming faster and faster, with more options for faster transport."	I_S0
"This proves that contemporary urbanites are increasingly demanding a fast paced life."	I_S0

"The given line graph compares the proportion of unemployed people in the US and Japan through the period from March 1993 to March 1999."	S_I0
"It is obvious that the unemployment rates of these two countries changed oppositely."	S_T1
"As can be seen from the given illustration, the unemployment rate in the USA was just over 7% in March 1993 while it was less than 2.5% in Japan."	S_M2
"However, this rate kept on decreasing in the USA while it went up in Japan."	B_S0
"In two years, the percentage of jobless Americans fall to just below 5.5% while it increased in Japan and stood at 3.0% at the same time."	I_S0
"The opposite trend of the line graph depicts that unemployment rate in the USA gradually declined while increased in the case of Japan."	I_S0
"The rates of joblessness in these two countries intersected between March 1998 and March 1999 when the unemployment rate in both countries was just about 4.5%."	I_S0
"At the end of 1998, the percentage of unemployment among the Americans became less than that of Japan."	I_S0
"The data presents that jobless people’s percentage in the USA was just above 4.0 in 1999 while this rate in Japan reached to over 4.5% which was more than double than the initial rate of their unemployment."	E_S0
 
"With the mounting amount of pressure and tension coming from school and work, people in the contemporary society are thrilled to find methods of relaxing and releasing stress."	B_I0
"Some individuals prefer to watch a movie or read a book, while others are more likely to get a splendid communication with mother nature."	I_I0
"From my personal perspective, I prefer the latter."	E_I0
"I strongly disagree that it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise."	S_T0
"Speaking off the top of my head, physical exercises provide us health, which is one of the basic needs being a human."	S_M1
"With such a compact daily life, we need long lasting energy to help us maintain a refreshing spirit."	B_S0
"People are not able to accomplish their work efficiently when they are sick."	I_S0
"For instance, my friend Bob, you can say that he hates exercising mare than anyone."	I_S0
"He is also obviously obese."	I_S0
"During weekends and vacations, he just stays at home and do nothing besides watching movies and playing video games."	I_S0
"He is always refreshed when he returns to school."	I_S0
"But he did not gain any advantage from this in the long term."	I_S0
"After a period of time, his grades started dropping gradually and he always argues with all of his friends."	I_S0
"The school nurse said that his diet is out of balance and that he is always in a bad mood."	I_S0
"We dicovered that this problem is so severe that it has to be solved immediately, so we helped Bob to sign up a sports summer camp."	I_S0
"As a result, he developed all kinds of sports skills and he is more outgoing after he lost weight."	E_S0
"On the other side, by doing exercises, we get exposed to a gigantic number of opportunities to communicate with others."	S_M1
"I used to be shy, I am always isolated at the cinema or at the library."	B_S0
"My grades are not very high at the moment, which made me more indrawn."	I_S0
"Even though I always try to relax, I was still exhausted."	I_S0
"But everything turned out to be the opposite after I participated in a baseball team, we were such a strong bond."	I_S0
"It seemed that our hearts were connected together and that I was more eager to make friends."	I_S0
"When I do physical exercise to relax, I gain a huge sense of achievement and confidence."	E_S0

"In some countries, high-speed rail is welcomed by many people because it can carry passengers between cities within a shorter period of time."	S_I0
"Some think the government should allocate a large sum of money into such railway lines, while others believe that the money should go to existing public transport."	S_T1
"Supporters of building high-speed rail argue that new railway lines can help save commuting time despite the massive investment."	S_M1
"With urban areas expanding further, more people may live in suburbs or even live in neighboring cities, and this means a new railway line between cities is especially important for those who need to travel to and from city centre for work."	B_S0
"If there were not such high-speed rail, it is impossible for many people living in rural areas to commute in and out of the city every day."	I_S0
"Therefore, a significant investment in the construction of high-speed railway lines is justified."	E_S0
"However, there are also some opponents against such investment, myself included, and they think the funds should go to existing public transport."	S_M1
"One major reason is lhat high-speed trains are expensive and the same amount of funds can be used to improve most of the current transport, including buses and underground trains."	B_S0
"These are still the main transport by which thousands of people use every day."	I_S0
"Another possible reason is related to the demand."	I_S0
"It is reported that there are still a large percentage of people living in cities and a new railway line outside of the town can only serve a small percentage of people."	I_S0
"This means the investment is not a sensible decision."	I_S0
"Ultimately there would be not enough funds to run the new railway system."	E_S0
"In conclusion, I believe that although there are benefits to some people living outside of the city if high-speed trains are developed, the number of rural population is still relatively low and existing public transport is still the main choice for most of population and should therefore be the priority of the investment."

"In today's society, with the rapid development of the world, there is a  consensus on whether to live quickly or slowly."	S_I0
"It concerned many people."	B_T1
"Obviously, affirmations on living quickly outweigh disagreements on this."	E_T1
"There are several reasons for it."	S_T0
"First of all, the world is developing quickly with many opportunity and chances which is very quick to disappear."	S_M0
"If you cannot work quickly and hold the opportunities you meet and be fare to meet risks, you will lose many ways to have progress."	B_S0
"For instance,I have a cousin Jim ."	I_S0
"He was not good at public speaking, however, when his teacher provide him a great chances to attend a competition, he agreed."	I_S0
"Because he always work quickly and didn't afraid to make mistakes, he discovered that he was actually a good public speaker."	I_S0
"After the competition, he progressed a lot."	E_S0
"In the second place, work quickly can develop our ability to be more efficient."	S_M0
"Since we may make mistakes at first, we will gradually make lesser mistakes and be more efficient."	B_S0
"Therefore, we can do things quickly and correctly."	I_S0
"And after this process, we can learn things quickly and don't need to worry about making mistakes."	E_S0
"In the third place, it's a great way to meet people, especially if you are new to an area."	S_M0
"While some people are naturally outgoing, others are shy and have a hard time meeting new people."	B_S0
"Doing things quickly can increase your braveness and gives you the opportunity to practice and develop your social skills."	I_S0
"It strengthens your ties to the community and broadens your support network, exposing you to people with common interests, neighborhood resources, and fun and fulfilling activities."	E_S0

"It can help you to catch more opportunities."	I_C0
"It also provides a great platform for you to be more efficient."	I_C0

"Many  university want to improve they education quality so to give more money to professor ,i think it is not good idea because sometimes spend more money than before not can solve then main problems."	S_T0
"First, some professor are not  good the for student  like many student dislike the professor because they power point is so bad, they are not good at communcate with student , homework are very difficult but he not teach them on the class etc. some students think they just want to earn the money not to focus on the teaching."	S_M2
"If the university spend more money on salaries for university professor  it is not a good idea to improve the quality of education."	S_S2
"Second ,universty want to improve the edaucation quality can spend money on train  the professor because professor 's job  is teaching students to get knowledge , so we can make a meeting to communcate to each other how to improve the education qualify or  spend money to hire the professional trainer to teach them and help to imporve the teaching"	O
 
"With the improvement of the technology, more and more museums are appearing in our society."	S_I0
"Some of them are free,while others need to pay fees for admission."	B_T0
"In my point of view, I think charging for admission is good for the development of a museum."	E_T0
"It's evident that charging do have some disadvantages."	S_M1
"A museum's duty is to let public learn more about the history about a city or a country , if the ticket is so expensive, there will be less people to visit it,which will let fewer people to get interest in history, and it may cause an absent of patriotism."	S_S2
"However, I think charging still have it benefits."	S_M1
"Firstly, and the most evident thing is that it provide income to the museums."	B_S0
"Every year, the government
spend a huge mount of money to support the museums."	I_S0
"If the museums charge money, it would reduce the financial burden of the government."	I_S0
"Apart from that, the museums can use the money the charged to upgrade and introduce more historical relics, which is helpful to let the museum be fresh an attract peoples."	E_S0
"Overall, Although charging may lead to loss of customers,It promote the development of museums and attract people in long terms."	S_C2

"As far as I am concerend, the essence of our project should be 'to encourage public to pay attention to their health.'"	I_S0

"These measures should offer public the incentive, so that they will keep healthy activley."	I_S0
"I regard this as the spiritual fundation of the task."	I_S0
"For instance, government should defuss the thought of ' the importance of excercising' and bring out some publishments which may arouse people's awareness of keeping a health condition."	I_S0
"More health-related TV series are also worth providing."	I_S0
"In schools, teachers are surpposed to guide students to do sports; In the communities, people should nourish seniors' interest in doing exercise."	I_S0

"To start with, there is no doubt that giving money to children as a reward will stimulate them to study harder."	S_M2
"Reading passages, working on math problems and writing, we cannot refute that studying is definitely boring and many children are forced to work hard."	B_S1

"Once the increasing TV channels has become a popular trend,consequently,there will be more programmers altering their orientations."	I_S0
"Initially,the competition among the TV programmers is about quality."	I_S0
"Since then ,they may regard innovation and creativity as the more essential parts."	I_S0
"However,to my mind,the advantages of having more TV channels far outweigh its disadvantages."	I_S0
"Firstly,it will definitly give people of different ages more choices."	I_S0
"From statistics and personal accounts from 2000 to 2016,the researchers of Cambrige University concluded that the percentage of people who perfer watching TV rather than other activities after the TV channels have increased rised from 45% to 75%."	I_S0

"Secondly,innovation and creativity have become popular talents and personalities around the world."	I_S0
"There is no doubt that innovation is being encouraged in different fields and countries."	I_S0
"For example,a new programme<< The meeting of Chinese poems>> has bencome popular in the world recently,for the approaches it uses and the themes it expresses are creative indeed."	I_S0
"All in all,from my personal perspective,the satisfaction of andiences is the most important part among the liabilities of TV programmers."	I_S0
"The inceasing variety of TV channels will have profound and benificial impacts on public."	E_S0
 
"Although the world where we live is changing so quickly and our life peace becomes quicker, I also hold an opinion that we are more happy and satisfied with our lives than people were in the past for three reasons."	S_T0
"Firstly, the emerging mature technology make our life more convenient."	S_M0

"It is a bad phenomenon which should be paid much attention to by society."	B_S0
"The first thing we have to do is to figure out the causes."	I_S0
"Here are there main couses."	I_S0
"As far as I am concerned,many students are so addicted to network that they become unwilling to look around the real world."	I_S0
"Many of them tend to bury themselves into virtul world which has a bad effect to their own lifes and their relationships with others."	I_S0
"Secondly, many students have no idea about their dreams."	I_S0

"Many studies can be tough and boring, which can be a big challenge for most of the students."	I_S0
"Lack of interest can be a big killer of students' future."	I_S0
"So,what can we do to improve this situation?"	I_S0
"Here are my suggestions."	I_S0
"First of all, colleges should be aware of the importance of students' ideas."	I_S0
"Many colleges have few activities, which cannot help students back to real life and get more friends."	I_S0
"Parents are also ought to take their kids out and find out the beauty of the world."	I_S0
"Also, our students should read more books and study harder to find out the great fun of study."	I_S0
"Meanwhile, colleges have the reponsibility of making courses more and more interesting."	I_S0
"From my opinion, only by doing these can we change this situation."	E_S0
 
"Actually, through the advancement of technology and education , people 's economic standard and life have been improved."	S_T1
"So , people have enough income to buy new products without to repairing them."	B_S1
"Secondly , people can see the advertisement of the products anywhere, then people will be attracted to buy them ,So people will pay attention to the trend , as soon as there is a new product , people will go to buy it."	E_S1
 
"Nowadays, some parents thinks to give money to their school-age children to reward them fo high grade is necessary,  while others do not think so."	S_T0
"In other words, some of former think that this way can make children know that if they work hard, they would gain more."	S_T1
"But in my opinion, I think this way would spoil the children."	S_T0
"Children who alway been given money as a reward would develop some wrong thinking."	S_M1
"They would think evrything they do should gain what they expected."	B_S0
"As we konwn, the competation of apply a famous university like the Yale and the Havard would be a extremly difficlut thing, if the children who always gain a rewars for high grade as they were young grow up, they might think in that way: "Oh, I want to apply this univeisity so I can gain the offer.""	I_S0
"The problem isthat  they ignore that what kind of level  of trying hard they need, they might think even do less can get the target."	I_S0
"Thinking in this way would impact their mental health."	E_S0
"It also would make these chlidren think money is the only thing they focus."	S_M1
"They would abandon their family, their friends and would be alone at last."	B_S0
"Just like some owner of big company, money is the only thing they want."	I_S0
"These traders just think how to make more and more money every and every time, they do not have energy to care about their parents' healthy, their children's grades, and maybe they would also give their children money as a reward just like when they as a children."	I_S0
"It would spoil their offspring too."	I_S0
"This circle would continue."	E_S0
"Form that all above, the parents who do in this way are not good at their children's growing."	B_C0
"Every one want to give a good education to their children, is not it?"	I_C0
"So, do not do in that way, please."	E_C0
 
"There is a discusstion about the TV channels."	S_T1
"Some people think that there shoukd be more channels for more options and other people think if there is too many channels the quality of lot of TV programs wil decrease."	B_S0
"In my opinion , I think more TV channels is a good idea."	I_S0
"The reason is,more TV channels can make many different TV programs played at the same time so people can do not wait a a channel for a TV programe."	I_S0
"Secondly,more TV channels make more competition between different TV channels."	I_S0
"The TV channel need make better programe to increase the number of people looking the channel,so I think more TV channels would not lead the quality of TV programes poor."	I_S0
"The less TV channels also can make a perblem that is there may only few channels have one programs,if some business buy a large range of time of this channel during the program,the users  wil couldn't enjoy the program they love."	I_S0
"However, there is also have drawbacks of too many TV channels."	I_S0
"If there is too many channels the user may spend lot of time on switch the channels for find the TV programe the user want to watch."	I_S0
"There are also have advantage of less TV channels,less TV channels means there may many programs at a same channel."	I_S0
"Therefore, the argument about change the channel will be less happened."	I_S0
"In conclusion,I think more TV channels is good."	I_S0

"However, in my opinion, i think preparing written books for them to read is the most effective way and it is based on the following reasons."	S_T0
"First of all, i think preparing written books for them to read can increase children's reading capability, which is one of the most important abilities for them."	S_M0
"If the parents prepared the books for them and encouraged children to read, the children will habe a positive attitude towards reading."	B_S0
"so it will benefited in their after life."	I_S0
"This good habit-- reading, probably will maintain the forever."	I_S0
"Especially for the young children that aged from 3 to 6, they can form good habits as soon as possibleForm good habits as soon as possible."	E_S0
"What is more, reading books can enrich children's knowledge, so prepare written books for them to read can let them doing better in their classes."	S_M0
"Because of their vast stores of knowledge, they must be stand out in their class."	B_S1
"And teachers may pay more attiention on them, therefore, they will get more knowledge, and their classroom learning is more efficient."	E_S1
"Parents reading aloud to children may not impress their children, so it is not a highly effective way."	S_M0
"And it is too young to these children to communicate with them, and it may cause antipathy,so the loss outweights the gain."	S_S2
"Therefore , i will choice to prepare written books for them to read."	S_C2

"While the second table reaveals that there was not too much change in the sale of bananas in UK during that period."	I_S0
"However, the demand for coffee had enhanced in all five countries."	I_S0
"What changed mostly in the sales of bananas was in Switzerland, increasing by 32 millions of euros, from 15 millions of euros in 1999 to 47 millions of euros in 2004."	I_S0
"In contrast, the demand for bananas had decreased in Sweden and Denmark during the same period."	I_S0
"And the total demand for bananas was not tremendous in other four countries."	I_S0

"When the student volunteers they can find confidence."	B_S0
"For example, when they finish work successfully, the partner will give thanks and encouragement; they can get sense of achievement."	I_S0
"In addition, they can boost their ability of expression."	I_S0
"For instance, they need to talk with other people while they work, so they can improve this capability very quick."	I_S0
"Moreover, their organisation capability will have a big enhancement."	I_S0
"For example, they have to arrange some things, and sometimes they need to introduce the work to a newbie; they need to teach everything to newbie."	I_S0
"Thus, they oblige to learn about and organize everything firstly."	E_S0
"In my opinion, volunteering is a decent experience for everyone."	S_M0
"The student can learn how to help other people."	B_S0
"For instance, when the people are coming, they need to give people help, and they will know the significance of aiding others."	I_S0
"On the other hand, they can obtain work experience."	I_S0
"A lot of companies pay attention to the work experience of applicants, and volunteering is a kind of work experience; it is crucial for the student in the future."	E_S0

"This experience can enhance the quality of people."	B_S0
"For example, the student can learn lots of positive things while they volunteer, and they can have an execllent change."	I_S0
"Above all, this way can save labor costs, because today labor costs are very expensive, through this method we can save lots of money."	E_S0

"Nowadays,many people argue that working fast is the most important while others believe that no mistakes should take the priority."	B_T0
"In my opinion,I disagree with the statement that working quickly and risking making mistakes is more important than working slowly and making sure everything is correct because I think everything is correct is the most important."	E_T0
"Firstly,if you make a mistake in a work,it means everything you did is meaningless because you have to work for it again and it actually will waste more time."	S_M0

"after finding a lower river, fries will spend 4 years in this fast flowing river in order to strengtheb their body, after they grow to 12-15 centermaters long, they will have another name called smolts."	I_S0
"After which, they will go right into the open sea to start their 5 years growth."	I_S0
"After they become mature with a length of 70-76 centermeters, the name salmon will be endowed to them."	I_S0
"Since which, a new life cycle starts."	I_S0

"Some people claim that working alone can help improve concerntration and do not disturbed by others."	E_I0
"As far as I am concerned, however, I believe that working together have more effictively and can reap more achievement."	S_T0
"To begin with, group study will get more things down in a short period of time owing to explicit divide th work."	S_M1
"In a team, each people have different part of work, so all of them have a sense of responsibility to work hard in order to acquire a wonderful results."	B_S0
"Moreover, different people will have different opinions which can provide some essential and useful suggestion to this group, and then the group leader will guild the team member to find a beat direction to slove the group assignment."	I_S0
"Take myself as example, copared with those teacher who often make his students study alone, our English teacher usually assign us must work together and we have a excellent consequece about the assignments quality."	I_S0
"Therefore, I believe that work together are much more effictively than work alone."	E_S0

"This improvement can acceletare the process of scientific research and provide tourists with fasinating attractions."	I_S0
"Scientists from several research areas, such as geology, biology and so on, usually need to seacrh for uncommom objects."	I_S0
"However, bad weather outside, poor transportation techniques, usually prevent them from going to remote natural environments."	I_S0
"Thus, they have been unable to carry on their research process."	I_S0
"As far as I remember, when human beings firstly began to discover the South Pole, pioneers counld not get rid of poor weather conditions and utilize advanced technology so that many of them died in the journey."	I_S0
"Nowadays, scientific researchers can reach these places in a safe and fast way."	I_S0
"Therefore, they can carry out large variaty of research programmes, without worrying about their security."	I_S0
"As for tourists, the possibility to travel to these remote areas greatly enlarges their choices of destinations, which enables them to better appreciate the bueaty of nature."	I_S0
"Primary concern about this improvement is whether they will face unprecedented danger or they may cause pollution to the natural environment."	I_S0
"Although these worries can not be diminished absolutely, there are ways to prevent them form happening."	I_S0
"Firstly, going to remote areas may bring about danger to life, such as falling into a volcano."	I_S0

"The lecture in the listening points out that  toady liner is not enough."	B_S0
"Some companies only can use liner for new landfills and disposal ponds."	I_S0
"Others do not have the material and do not be required to use it for old landfills."	I_S0
"It could cause damage that the coal ash compoents wiil leak into ground water and finally  pollute drinking water."	I_S0
"People should restrict the regulation to protect the environment."	E_S0
"The secondary theory in the reading indicates that the amount  of coal ash bgenerate by some particular plants can be recycled."	S_M0
"People can be concerned about recycled products  and use coal ash environmentally."	B_S0
"The lecture,nevertheless agrues that in the past there are a material that can recycled use."	I_S0

"It is  obvious that the energy resoures conservation is burning and we could help by reusing household garbages, while the result is not satisfying."	B_T1
"I believe that more wastes could be recycled with rules and regulation established the authority."	E_T1
"The reason why the amount of wastes putting in recycling is not enough is due to the lack of awareness of recycling garbages."	B_S0
"The public, who do not understand how serious the resource shortage is and only take care about their own business, do not understand the meaning and purpose of reusing the wastes."	I_S0
"They are not motivated to reuse water used for washing food to swep the floor and collect the wasted  batteries or other metal mateirals to the consititude where these mateirals can have  a second use."	I_S0
"As they could not see the effects and benefits related to their daily life, it may be impossible for them to make a contribution to these prosess."	I_S0
"However, with a stirct requirement, they have to obey the rule, otherwise they will be punished."	I_S0
"Because stringent rules like penalty has a sufficient deterrence on getting individuals to fulfill their duty."	I_S0
"In the face of the risk of pay fees for not recycling the wastes, residents are likey to pay more attention to the household wastes which can be use for a second time."	I_S0
"For instance, once the rule is implemented  requiring that people, who only use new plastic bag instead of the used one, will be punished with 10 dollar, people might remember to reuse the bag when shopping."	I_S0
"These can help the whole society to recycle the domestic waste, increasing the amount of recycled garbages to achieve the expected volumes."	I_S0

"Even to those naughty ones, thay may waste some bills at first, as time goes by and the limitation for the quantity of money, they will realize that the only way to get what they want at most they must have a logical plan on their purchasing."	I_S0
"And that will help children develop the ability on spending money logically."	E_S0
"In addition, we all have experience for saving money of breakfast or studying tools just for getting our fancy stuff."	S_M1
"And just recalling back what will you do toward the stuff which you buy it on your saving money?"	B_S0

"It has been widely discussed that the population explosion will bring a large quantities of serious social and environmental problems to humanity."	S_I0

"And my Chinese teacher, she was asked to choose physics as the major, but she had an argue with her father."	I_S0
"After a long-time argument, her parents finally consent her choice."	E_S0
"Second, I know that there are some people think that nowadays more and more teenagers can make their own choice like choosing their major on their own, choosing their fere by themselves, but I think their parents play an important role in making their own choices."	S_M1

"Firstly, students need to focus on their own major rather than take history courses which has no relation with their own major."	S_M1
"students will be stressful if they are required to take history courses, because it takes a lot of time that should be free before."	S_S2

"However, from the reality, the overall advantages outweigh the disadvantages."	E_T1
"The reasons are as follows."	S_S2
"Increasing life span is essentially a kind of welfare for citizens."	S_M1
"When citizens are young and healthy, they use their energy to create their own productivity for the society, and they have the right to receive returns after retirement."	B_S1

"They may naturally relate study with exams and grades instead of knowlege, skills and virtures that are more necessary, thus becoming students who may have good grades but lacks abilities."	I_S0
"Additionally, the behavior is likely to destroy the fun of study."	I_S0
"As what has been found, when the encouragement from the outside is too much, the inner interest can be replaced."	I_S0

"I believe people are willing to help others like what they were before."	E_S0
"Second, I think helping others is a kind of significant quality in every culture."	S_M1

"The adult in the familiy will teach the children always be enthusiastc to others because there will be a day that we will need help from others like what we do to others before."	E_S0
"Last but not least, I may think people are more willing to help others in the old days."	S_M1
"On many media station on the internet like Youtube, there are many social experiment, and most of these experiment shows that people are busier than before because the beat of modern society are too fast."	B_S0
"Most of people just passed away with their head down when thay see someone needs help."	I_S0
"We can't blame on them because help or not it's their right, and they need to protect themselves more than before because the terrorism are becoming more and more serious in thede days."	E_S0

"As a result,rhe improved behaviour homeowners could lead to a clean,waste-free environment for everyone."	E_S0

"Eventhough many elder people might insist that cooking is essential in life and people spend same time in that in the future."	E_I0
"I am convinced of that human will spend less time preparing foods in twenty years for the following reasons."	S_T1
"First and foremost, the people in future will be more busy and have no enough time to cook."	S_M2
"This is primarily because more new fields has come through with the improvment of technology and more and more complex tasks will exist to be solved with the development of society."	B_S0
"Consequently, people have to pay more attention to their main job which will lead to the decrease in the devotion to cooking."	I_S0
"On the contrary, if people still spend same time in cooking as today, they will have less time to handle even more and more complex works."	I_S0
"For such reason, this kind of people will be eliminated."	I_S0
"There is no better illustration of the idea than the experience of my and my elder male cousin."	I_S0

"Nevertheless, I am in Wuhan University now, I have much more tasks to finish and have no extra time to enhance myself or to have a relax."	I_S0
"Just twelve years gone, there were more tasks for people to do, not to mention twenty years after now."	E_S0
"Furthermore, some technologies wolud be invented to help people handle their life such as preparing foods."	B_C1
"This is largely due to the fact that more and more basic tasks will be handled by AI rather than human."	E_C1
"Owing to more complex work waithing for human, the simplest works like cooking will be done by robots and they may finish these better than human."	B_S0
"In contrast, if the human still spend more time in basic tasks, there is no need for the world to develop artifical intelligence."	I_S0
"For instance, a research finished by Wuhan University showen that many kinds of work would disappear in human's world."	I_S0
"And the cooking is the most dangerous one, because the techonlogy is enough to let robot solve this problems better than human nowadays."	E_S0

"That is a really advancement in China,which should be seen as the positive repreasentations."	I_S0

"For example, the washing machine has saved us out of the work for keeping our clothes clean."	I_S0
"You shall do any other things during the process when it works."	I_S0
"Can it not be the positive effect of the electronic devices?"	I_S0

"Firstly, As for the social problems, communication is one of the major issue for people who cannot use the foreign language well."	S_M1

"At other times, i just close my mouth and sit in the corner."	I_S0
"my teacher and classmate even think i am a very introvert person."	E_S0

"While the proposal seems to be feasible, other solutions should be fully considered as well."	S_T0
"On the one hand, I agree that more sports facilities do can improve public health."	S_M0
"This is because people have more free access to do exercise, compared to fitness centre which a great majority people may unwilling to pay for."	B_S0
"Exposed to these facilities, people have an inclination to do sports rather than just collaping the in front of the screen every evenings since they can be influence by those who are doing exercise."	I_S0
"A virous of facilities which cater for  all ages enables people can enjoy their favorite types of sports."	I_S0
"Accloringly, public dooing exercise regularly,  their immune systems improved and their bodies strengthened."	E_S0
"However, considering many people who are unwilling to do sports , in other words , they may ignore those facilities  and choosing not doing sports."	S_M0
"Consiquently , this measure is not the best and other methods also need to be adopted."	B_S1
"First of all , people tend to have a sedentary lifestyle as they  might have no awareness about the importance of health so government could emphasise more on raising public awarness,such as advertising and set some relevant courses and so on."	E_S1
"Futhermore ,the reason why many young generations do not sports is that they are under pressure of study and career, which mean they have no spare to concentration on healthy lifestyle ."	S_M0
"To tackle with the problem,schools should have more sports classes as well decrese students homework , while companies release employees' work load and decrease the situation of working over time encourage them to have a healthy lifestyle."	S_S2

"Commonly, the teacher would not always agree with our own views at class, they may cast doubt on our opinions."	S_T0

"Moreover, connecting with the person after everything has been done could show one's positive attitude."	S_M0
"Think if you just talk to the teacher directlyat class without reconsiderate what the best answer is or do nothing, the teacher might feel disappointed and won't appreciate you because of your discouraging attitude."	B_S1
"But on the other hand if you contack with the teacher after school, the teacher would praise you for your willing to study and that might come up with the best result ."	E_S1
"Finally, getting along with the teacher could help you learn more from the teacher and improve on your performance."	S_M0
"When talking with the teacher primately without being interrupted, you can even learn extra knowledge form the teacher to broaden your aspect and get better grades in the campus."	B_S0

"However, because it is more likely now that both parents work, there is little opportunity for children to stay in their own home up to that age."	S_T1
"Instead, they will probably go to a nursery school when they are much younger."	S_T0

"The reading provides three ways which are useful to save Torreya taxifoha that will become extinct."	B_I0
"However, the lecturer rebuts all the points and says that none of the points in the passage give satisfactory solutions."	E_I0
"Firstly, the reading suggests that reestablishing Torreya in the same location is a good method since a micorclimate in that place benefits Torreya to grow successfully."	S_M0
"However, the lecturer argues that the global warming has strongly affected the micorclimate in large regions of Florida recently."	B_S1
"Some areas became drier than before which could not meet the condition that Torreya needs to grow."	E_S1
"Secondly, the writer illustrates that since some scientists believed that Torreya can grow well in the forests which located in further north hence moving Torreya to that area is a wonderful choice."	S_M0
"Nevertheless, the professor demonstrates gives an example as other kind of trees named Black locus to support his own statement."	B_S0
"When people moved Black locus to other region, this kind of tree spread quickly in the new environment which caused many plants and trees became extinct."	I_S0

"Firstly."	I_S0
"the students have too much stresses from parents and teacher."	I_S0
"Parents always want us to have better life,so they think that we need work hard and try our best to get high mark."	I_S0

"Times are gone when people's choice for TV programmes were extremely limited."	S_T1
"Today I would critically disscuss both views and then come up with my own opinion."	B_S0
"Someone who support to have more TV channels are mainly due to the fact that they may feel easier to choose different TV programmes for people have different taste."	I_S0
"For instance,some young people enjoy watching entertianment while older are more interested in news channels."	I_S0
"Some children may watch educative programmes to broaden their horizons while certian adauls are liked to watch soup series to spending their time."	I_S0
"Nevertheless,some people claimed that too many TV channels only leads to a lot of poor quality TV programmes."	I_S0

"On the other hand,the professional quality programm productors is not capable of keeping up with the nember of TV programmes."	I_S0
"Even though,it is difficult to control the process of different talanted show which may included some inexpective sense."	I_S0
"As far as I concerned,although increasting TV channels have shortcomings,they are in a positions to give more enormous satisfaction to residents who needs as long as low-qualities TV channels by authorities concerned."	I_S0

"I  dusgree this opinion."	B_S0
"The facts have proved the trength of the individual also plays a great role in improving the environment."	I_S0
"Firstly,individuals will spend less time and miney in improving environment,compared with governments."	I_S0
"Without a long period of preparation and a massive investment ,the environment in a community can be improved muvh easilier by individuals."	I_S0
"As lonf as citizens get off work or go out of school with free time ,they can spend only a little time on simple cleaningwhich is effective  method to improve enviroment."	I_S0
"On the other hand ,personal effort and attemtion are also a good publicty for the reason that it can encounrage governments and big companies to try them best to change environment ."	I_S0
"Lisening to the voices of the citizens,government would make higher investment into envionmental protection ,while big companies would also be fored to solve environmental pollution problems ,such as  clean the river ,upgrade thewaste dosposal system."	I_S0
"Admittely,there are also a few measures that can only be achieved by the government  rather than the indisduals ."	I_S0
"These pollution problems could only be solved by fonds."	I_S0
"However,this is only a part of enrionmental improvement ."	I_S0
"More measures can be and only be acheived by ondadials and citizens also have responsibility to change our environment."	I_S0

"As far as I'm concerned, I' not for this kind of idea used by many parents."	B_T1
"There are a few reasons why I'm against it."	I_T1
"In my opinons, although receiving high grades can make parents satisfied and feel proud when talking it with other people, offering their children money may not be the proper way."	I_T1
"It can indeed encourage students to work harder in their studies, but it can mislead children to study for their parents but not themselves."	I_T1
"I think studying should be a motivated prosess and it's not linked with money."	I_T1
"Besides, offering too much money to children who are young and cannot spend it wisely might cause wastes or even worse effects."	E_T1
"I remember when I was a child in elementary school, some of my classmates' parent used this kind of strategy to encourage their children."	S_M2
"And for our school is one of the best among our district, the studying fees used to be high and most of my schoolmates came from wealthy families."	B_S0
"My deskmate was one of the example, for she was about a middle student in our class, her parents might offer she a lot of money if she once rank top 10 in our class."	I_S0
"She sometimes could won the prize but after she won it she would be too proud of herself and spent less time to study from then on."	I_S0
"What's worse?"	I_S0
"She used most of the money to buy novels that were written on the websites which did no good wo our studies and became addicted in them."	I_S0
"There's no doubt tha she became even worse than she used to be before she won the prize."	E_S0
"She also made our teacher angry about her"	O
 
"People are bound to face many job opportunities in their life."	S_I0
"In order to survive, they have to make a choice."	B_T0
"Thus, many people argue that majority of people prefer to work in one company all their whole lifetime of employment, and this is a better option for employees."	E_T0
"However, another group of people would prefer to work for as many as they could work to get diverse kind of experience."	S_T1
"I would choose the latter view."	S_S2
"In my opinion,if people choose the latter, these people have access to different systems available in the market."	S_M1
"This can increase the market value of the individual, let them have higher wages to improve their quality of life."	B_S0
"At the same time, I think that we need to give us the opportunity to meet great challenges."	I_S0
"People think that in the new environment, there must be great and new opportunities to expand your vision."	E_S0
"However, another point of view has its advantages."	S_M1
"there is a group of people who dedicate their careers to only one company."	B_S0

"In this essay, I will analyze the sorts of relationships influenced by the technology and"	O
"In terms of the interactions between people, technology produces a sum of changes."	S_M0
"First of all, it results in the change in people communication methods."	B_S0
"The high-tech telecommunications, such as pads and phones, are in the place of those traditional communication devices."	I_S0
"What’s more, the advert of new technology also changes whom people can chat with."	I_S0
"They’re not restricted in acquaintances, people can also talk with strangers."	E_S0
"On the one hand, it is undeniable that this phenomenon brings about a list of merits."	S_M0
"It empowers people to contact with friends and families much easier."	B_S0
"This is primarily because people have more alternatives, which means can keep in touch with their acquaintances at any time."	I_S0
"They can also be on video call with each other."	I_S0
"In addition, it plays an important role in making new friends."	I_S0
"More traditionally, people can only meet new friends in reality, which was very limited by region."	I_S0
"Nowadays, however, they can even acquaint with foreigners."	E_S0
"On the other hand, every coin has two sides, it also contributes negatively to people’s life."	S_M0
"The booming of internet and communication tools rends people to be more isolated."	B_S0
"It makes people prefer to interact with net friends rather than relatives in actual life, as a consequence, they are more likely to indulge in the virtual world and ignore the real life."	I_S0
"And this will lead to a dearth of communication skills in their daily life."	E_S0
"To sum up , the technology raises a lot of changes in communication methods and objects, and it also results in both benefits and drawbacks."	B_C1
"However, due to the fast pace of peoples life, the advantages overweight the demerits."	E_C1
 
"When faced with the statement that people always feel less bored if they solve the different kinds of tasks rather than always do the same thing, ideas vary form person to person."	B_T1
"Quite a few prefer to agree with it , while others still keep a doubt viewpoint about this statement."	I_T1
"I side with the former points, and my argument for this point are listed as followed."	E_T1
"First of all, it can promote your feeling of freshness."	S_M1
"Trace back to your daily life, if you always do the same thing over and over again, I bet you will feel lack of satisfaction."	B_S0
"That not to say you should do lots of hamful tasks which is none of difference between each other and you just like a machine to do this action regularly."	I_S0
"For instance, when you are a student, would you are willing to learn same coure all the day?"	I_S0
"Therefore, doing some different task can take some new feeling to you."	E_S0
"Besides, doing different things can improve your efficiency."	S_M1
"Having lots of discoveries all prove that if people keep doing the same thing, although they have strongest willpower but their efficiency of dealing with problem will decrease."	B_S1
"We can imagin, under this circumstance, to begain with, you may feel not bad, however, after dozen of hours later, I guess your mind may full of variety things which must have negative impact on your working efficiency."	E_S1
"Of course, choosing do the same things all the day also have some ralative resonable to some extent, like if the due day of the task will come and so on."	B_C1
"However, if all these factors are considered, we may find that the logical of my agrument may carry more weight than the others."	E_C1
"From what has been dicussed, we may finally drew the conclusion that according to different perspective, doing all kinds of variety tasks always have more advantages than only to one thing over and over again."	S_S2
 
"Recently,the number of teenagers are leaving schools because of hating study."	S_T1
"Many factors lead to this phenomenon."	B_S0
"First,this society gives students too many pressures which make them stay away from enertainments or outdoor activities."	I_S0
"But in fact,students need more time to relax their mood."	I_S0
"Lots of pressures always lead things develope to opposite direction."	I_S0
"So,they usually have negative thoughts on studying."	I_S0
"Second,our education only focous on study skills or practices instead of study interest."	I_S0
"Thus,many children are not interested in study,and they do not know significance of study for themselves."	I_S0
"So they choice other things they like rather than sutdy in school."	I_S0
"Finally,this society has too many temptations."	I_S0
"That lead students' attention transfer to other things which are not relevant to study."	I_S0
"Their thoughts and emotions are attractived by other things,so they do not have more time to study."	I_S0
"How to change this situation?"	I_S0
"How to make teenagers have positive thoughts on studying?"	I_S0

"Then,schools need to reduce children's pressures."	E_S0
 
"I have something to say about whether the university should be convenient for students from rural areas to enter the University."	B_T0
"First of all, universities should consider whether rural students can get a good university education."	I_T0
"But this should not be a reason for universities to grant privileges to rural students."	I_T0

"However, people in the past have a lot of difficult time to go through."	I_S0
"For example, they may had a time worrying about their food or crops."	I_S0
"So young peope in the past have no alternatives but to follow their parents to go through the difficult time."	I_S0
"They didn't have the condition that give them rights to make decisions about their own lives."	E_S0
"Last but not the least, young people now are more personalized than young people in the past."	S_M0

"However, young people now are freer, adults are more respect to their thoughts."	I_S0
"In this way, young people nowadays have cultivated their own personalities to think personally."	I_S0

"Instead, they reflect the public popularity of sport in general and the level of public support that successful stars can generate."	I_S0
"So the notion of “fairness” is not the issue."	E_S0
"While those who feel that sports stars’ salaries are justified might argue that the number of professionals with real talent are very few, and the money is a recognition of the skills and dedication a person needs to be successful."	S_M1
"Competition is constant and a player is tested every time they perform in their relatively short career."	B_S0
"The pressure from the media is intense and there is little privacy out of the spotlight."	I_S0

"I am in favor of the former point of view the advantages of better consequences of improved medical care outweigh the disadvantages."	S_T0
"The reasons are presented below."	S_M2
"To develop sports and improve people's health is what everyone yearns for, and a reasonable diet is the key."	B_S0
"To improve medical care, people can have a certain understanding of their health anytime and anywhere."	I_S0

"In my view,although it has some positive effects,there are also some disadvantages of being self-employed."	E_T0
"It is no doubt that many causes would lead to this situation."	S_M1
"Firstly,to some extent,people who are working for a company would be limited in many aspects."	B_S0
"For example,people need to go to work on time and cannot leave their places ramdonly in their working time."	I_S0
"Secondly,pressures from leaders of an organisation are massive."	I_S0
"For example,employers would offen make comparison of employees and the horrible atmosphere of competition in a company would let employees feel tough and even hopeless."	I_S0
"Thirdly,compared with working for a company,being self-employed have less limitations and the free working atmosphere makes people choose to be self-employed."	E_S0
"By the way,there are some disadvantages exist."	S_M1
"Firstly,being self-employed means that people should open their own company or building their own studios."	B_S0
"In addition,many people do not have enough money to complete that."	I_S0
"Secondly,it has large risk."	I_S0
"For example,people who are self-employed should not only do their work,but also should concern about the operation of their own companies,many of them are not experienced enough and it would easily contribute to bankruptcy."	I_S0
"Thirdly,the competition between people who are self-employed is fierce because most companies which are established by people who are seld-employed are small and they would be easily eliminated by big companies at the beginning."	E_S0

"Having more programs means people have more choices."	I_S0
"We can access more information from much more places."	I_S0
"For most satellite TV stations annonce their local news only,more channels suggest that you can get information from more places."	I_S0
"Meanwhile,more programs mean that you can get big issues every few hours."	I_S0
"Always updating your news and information is vital to this global worid."	I_S0
"More programs provide more entertainment for us."	I_S0
"We can watch different kinds of programs,such as talk show,real people show,cartoon and recommended film,at the same time."	I_S0
"When we do not want to watch the program of a channel at this time,we can quickly switch to another channel and do not need to spend so much time on finding a program I like or have to watch a program I dislike."	I_S0
"So it can be a more pleasing experience."	I_S0
"While some people support it,many people hold a negative attitude towards it,considering that these programs could be of poor quality."	I_S0
"It is a common sense that products made in a shorter time may be rougher."	I_S0

"Nowadays, since the country is develping in a really fast speed, how to make full use of the land is becoming a popular topic among citizens."	B_I0
"Some people think that the government should build new housing to replace old buildings so that the city can catch up with the quick speed of development."	E_I0
"However, I suggest that preservation of old and historic buildings is much more important because it can remind up people a sense of proudness and bring more opportunities for the city deveopment."	S_T1
"Firstly, historic buildings can let citizens know the backgroud story of their city, which will make them be more familiar with the place they live in so that they will gain a sense of belonging and be proud of their own home."	S_M0
"For example, Wuhan government is really value of preserving old buildings."	B_S0
"There are many historic buildings that are well protected since the world war two where many schools arrange their students to visit and learn the history."	I_S0
"After a specific studying, this young generation becomes loving their country and city deeper and deeper."	E_S0
"In addition, the government can also benefit from the historic building by using them attract more tourists and comsumers."	S_M0
"For example, in Wuhan, the government successfully combine the historic buildings and shopingmall to produce a popular tourism center that not only tourists but also local citizens are willing to go there."	B_S1
"The government on the one hand creates a lot of financial opportunities, on the other hand well advertises the city to the world."	E_S1
"Some people may think that the city need more morden buildings to fit the development and those old buildings are useless and dangerous."	S_M0

"For one thing,it's the individuals that carry out governments' policys concerning the environment."	B_S0
"For example,in order to cut down the usage of fossil fuels,the government needs individuals to be willing to purchase electricity produced by environmentally-friendly resources like wind energy."	I_S0
"Otherwise, the govornment and big corporations' effort to exploit new resources would likely go down the drain with no individual accepting them."	I_S0
"For another,individuals,at times,can come up with innovative ideas that have not been thought of by govornment officials to protect the environment."	I_S0
"It is reported that an ordinnary American girl devised this creative plan to turn waste oil into cheap fuels heating houses in the winter,thus recycling the energy."	I_S0
"Had her individual work not been appreciated,the poor locals would have suffered both heavy pollution caused by coal and cold winter as many of the locals could not afford coal."	I_S0
"However,the two points above are not to say that we do not need govornments and big companies to preserve our earth."	I_S0

"People have different views about whether unpaid community service should be a compulsory part of high school programmes."	S_T1
"In my opinion, I largely agree unpaid community service should be a compulsory part of high school programmes."	S_T0
"As far as I'm concerned ,doing some unpaid community service is good for the students to make friends when they study in the high school."	S_M1
"Some unpaid community service may require the different class to take part in, so students can make friends with someone new."	B_S1
"What's more, these unpaid community service such as working for a charity give a large amount of opportunities to the students to communicate with each other and this is a excellent way for the students to expand their social networks."	E_S1
"Another key factor that I agree with unpaid community service is that it can improve the sense of community responsibility of the high school students."	S_M1
"There is no doubt that it it necessary for school to improve the students academic skills and other characters ,particularly their sense of community responsibility."	B_S0
"By taking part in this unpaid community service,students can approach the real society."	I_S0
"And the volunteer jobs in the community allow them to interact with various needy groups, offering relevant assistance within their strength."	I_S0
"Therefore, these students will further strengthen their ability to help more people."	E_S0
"Even though participating in proper volunteer jobs is reasonable, forcing students to do it deprives students of their own options."	S_S2
"To conclude, the unpaid community service should be promoted in high school."	B_C1
"However, schools are suggested to consider students’ will so that schools can guarantee the validity of these volunteer activities."	E_C1

"But now ,with the continuous development of science   and technology,with money reward children's progress this now is becoming more and more common."	S_T0
"Some parents think is of course to children some role in promoting have power,the starting point is good,parents will pocket money as education for children or transfer a cultural significance of the important means,or as a reward,or as a kind of an expression of love,or as a result of return."	S_M1
"Money reward law really can enhance the enthusiasm of child labor,more important is to let the children know that make money not easy,encourage them to earn returns through labor,this understandable."	B_S0
"But, the simple money reward method only receive short-term effects,easy to make the child becomes the utility,obsessed."	I_S0
"In addition,some children still doesn't know how to save money ,and possible disorderly the money,Therefore,in the long run,simple to meet and incentive the child with money,for the development of children is unfavorable."	E_S0
"In fact,money reward law is just a kind of auxiliary of the education method,the children were adults must ,appreciation and the praise the psychological needs,meet this need ,can be a hug,a genuine praise, a small gift,the same can achieve good effect."	S_M1
"So I think children access to money ,sooner or later ,and avoid earlier than a child's money consciousness,In order to avoid the child to spending money or too greed money."	B_S1

"Also,Private Vehicle accounts for about one of fifth."	I_S0
"Then,seldom British people sue Public Transport Vehicle to out who account for only 13%,however,higher than those who were used to go out by Lorries and Other Commercial Vehicle."	I_S0
"In 1985,a host of people use their own car to go out and the proportion of people by Recreational Vehicle was sharply decreased from 56% to 4%."	I_S0
"In 2005,about three of fourths go outside by their own transport which is higher than that in 1965 and 1985."	I_S0

"Nowadays, students who enter the university are mostly struggled by choosing major subjects since they have to not only consider about the subjects they are interested in, but also take the future job growth into consideration."	B_T0
"Although some university students prefer to choose subjects related to math and science that enable them to have significant job growth even though they have no interest in these subjects, I do not believe that students who do not interested in those subjects should study them for future career."	E_T0
"First of all, if students force themselves to study science and math even though they are not interested in, their motivation to study will be greatly reduced."	S_M0
"As far as we know, that is to say,'interest in the best teacher'."	B_S0
"Most of the people would lack motivation to study and figure out tough academic issues unless they have strong interests toward certain subject."	I_S0
"If students are interesed in other subjects rather than science, math or engineering, they would have little motivation to learn, they will just study them for finging jobs and get money in the future."	I_S0
"Also, it is unavoidable for students to face many challenges while learning, and they have to remember tough formulas and scientific theoies, which require high motivation to strike to studying instead of giving up."	I_S0
"It is very likely for them to lose motivation to learn whenever they face challenges."	I_S0
"Gradually, their academic performance will also be negatively affected."	E_S0
"Secondly, choosing scientic subjects as majors even though students are not interested in would weaken their self-confidence."	S_M0
"In general, students' interests are generated from achievement, if some students always get excellent academic performance in certain subject, they would have sense of achievement and stronger interests."	B_S0
"In this case, some students who do not like those subjects may lack ability to study them."	I_S0
"So if they force themselves to study these subjects, they would have troubles in understanding concepts and remembering formulas."	I_S0
"In this way, their study efficiency would be largely reduced, which will lead them to get awful academic performance and be frustrated."	I_S0
"Financially, they would lose self-confidence."	E_S0
"Even though regarding some subjects that have job growth as majors enables university students to feel easily to find jobs and have a better future, this cannot make sure that they will have motivation and willpower to keep learning when they face challenges since interest is very important."	S_M0
"All in all, I think it is not a good idea to choose subjects that are not fit students' interests even though those subjects are closely related to significant future job growth."	S_C2
 
"In this day and age,people are living in a fast-speed life and they may use things for only a short while and then throw them away,which are called a "throw-away" lifestyle."	S_I0
"Reflecting on why this lifestyle appeared,we can realize that we waste much more than before because we can make more money."	S_M1
"As a result,we don't cherish the things we used than previous time for considering that we can buy a lot of staffs easily so we are more likely to love the new and loathe the old."	B_S0
"The second reason for the "throw-away" society is that we are living in a rushed life that makes ourselves feel anxious and hurried all the time."	I_S0
"In this matter of fact,we need to update the things frequently to adapt this fast developing environment."	E_S0

"Punishment is a way which  makes children remember what they should do."	B_S0
"If there is no punishment when children violate theachers' instruction,they will not behave good in grades."	I_S0
"Children will do many things like this if there is no punishment."	E_S0
"In the other hands."	S_M1
"There will be a negative influence if we punish children overweight."	B_S0
"They will try to avoid punishment rather than change their behaviors."	I_S0
"There several metheds which will be benefit to help chlidren to identity the difference between right and wrong at an age."	I_S0
"When they make some mistakes, we can ask them to find a useful way which can restore their mistakes."	E_S0

"Family education is a particularly important aspect."	S_I0
"I think paying more attention to family education when a child is young will have a great impact on his later develoment."	S_T1

"It is a part of parenting and it is something that will benefit you as you grow up."	I_S0
"Now a lot of people don't understand what's going on in the mind of a parent who's been very strict with their children form a very young age but the idea of parenthood is always for the good of the child."	I_S0
"There is no parent in the world who doesn't like their children."	I_S0
"So the influence of family on children is very critical."	E_S0
"As it happens,one of the reports that I came across not long ago about the effects of family education is a series of reports about juvenile delinquency in today's society."	S_M2

"Nowadays,a great number of students adopt a negative attitude
towards studaying,which is a great concern for their parents and society."	S_T1
"It is significant to figure out how this situation comes into being,and what can be done to address this issus."	B_S0
"the obvious cause associating with this problem is the heavy burden imposed on students."	I_S0
"this is because a higher level of diploma can earn one a descent job,it is very common to see parents force their children to get a good grade with no spare effort,leaving students very exhausted every day."	I_S0
"numerous students involving inmore and more entertaining activities is another reason."	I_S0
"Watching yelevision ,playing video games and browsing Internet show much more attractions to students."	I_S0
"these receations takes students too much spare time and this will leave students not enough time to focus on their study,which will definately lead to poor academic performance."	I_S0
"it can not ignored that the confidence in study largely determine the attitude towards study tasks."	I_S0
"Fortunately,there are some approaches to help students convert their attitudes to study."	I_S0
"firstly,it is helpful for teathers and parents to illustrate why study is important and essential."	I_S0
"Rather than forcing their children to bury themselves in homework,imparting them the knowledge they owned will provide them with a better life and more importantly,a more wide horizon to the world."	I_S0

"It is the common fact that more and more students are leaving schools with negative thoughts on studying."	S_T1
"In my oppionion, I think it is include the following three reasons to cause the phenomenon."	B_S0
"First of all, the students are given much study stress from their family and school."	I_S0
"Teachers often left much homework and give many exams to students, so they have to work hard."	I_S0
"On the weekend, their parents send them in the tutorials of all subjects, as a result, their relax time is istead of the studying battle."	I_S0
"Their parents also compared between other childrenn and their own children."	I_S0

"As you know, negative thoughts and motions are the most influential to people."	I_S0
"last but not least, there are less application in reality for the knowledge stdying in the school."	I_S0
"So it can cause the thought that students make, which is useless for future."	I_S0
"According the three causes above, i think that the students should be given more relax time, for the teachers and parents, they should more unstand the students."	I_S0
"For the students, i think students should be careful to choose their freinds."	I_S0

"I don't think it's a good idea that "some parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade thay get in school."	B_I0
"Nowadays,many children study just for the prize that from their parents,even most of children don't want to study at all."	I_I0
"Giving the money to children for their high grades make the children utilitarian and lack of the independent."	E_I0
"Firstly,giving money for good grades will make the children think that studying just for money and it is not their own thing."	S_M1
"I had a friend when I studied in meddle school."	B_S0
"this friend's parents would gave the money to him when he got good grades."	I_S0
"During this time, his grades are very high and he studied most of time."	I_S0
"But one day,his parents didn't give money to him,and he argued with his families and his grades started to be lower,he never be the interested in study."	I_S0
"Studying is a neccessary thing for children, whatever they can get the money or not."	E_S0
"Secondly,giving money will make the children think it is easy to get the money and waste money."	S_M1
"My friend Mike is a good student, he always get high grades,and his families give him money as the prize."	B_S0
"In this way, he often spend money on many things,and he don't know how to save the money."	I_S0

"As the improvement of disposable income in society, people are having more ability and willingness to donate their money for someone who is needed."	B_T1
"Some families choose to give money to charitable organizations while others choose to give money directly to the needy."	E_T1
"For me, I prefer the first one."	S_T0
"As we known, the charitable organizations are experienced with dealing with this problem, especially on investigate whether some people need help or not."	S_M1
"For individuals, we have less knowing about who we should give money."	B_S0
"We don't have time to check out the background of someone because we have our own job to do."	I_S0
"Also, we can't just pick someone on the streets who looks poor, especially someone who pretend they are poor and use this to gain profits."	I_S0
"For instance, lots of news has been reported that lots of beggers earn more than ten thousand per month, even more than someone who work by themselves through effort."	I_S0

"Imagine that the begger you just think he has a low living standard but actually with two cars and a house with garden."	I_S0
"I believe that majority of people can't accept that."	I_S0
"We are worring that our kindness are been used."	I_S0

"They can investigate the background of the people who are need to help by field visit or checking their files through government."	I_S0
"Its not only benefit for the people who need help, but also make us feel justice and comfortable."	E_S0
"What's more, giving money to charitable organizations are more efficient."	S_M1
"For example, you have only 1000 available fund for charity and you just donate it directly to a hope school."	B_S0
"1000 is hardly for them to improve their financial situation."	I_S0
"But, the charitable organizations can integrate the resources."	I_S0
"They can receive 1000 from 100 people and they will have 100000."	I_S0
"This will help the hope school a lot."	E_S0
"Last but not least, some people will say that the charitable organizations may corrupt and take money to gain their own profit instead of use it on charity."	B_C0

"Such personnel are conducive to the mass recycling of waste products by relevant people."	I_S0
"In my opinion, just changing the authority of these personnel can help relevant personnel to collect waste materials quickly."	I_S0
"As long as the scope of their collection is expanded to make them collect more frequently and have more personnel, it will be very good."	I_S0

"Nowadays, a number of people decide to work for themselves instead of someone else in a company."	S_T1
"The following essay will discuss the reasons for this trend and any problems people may face if they are their own boss."	O
"The main reason to begin with is due to the various economic and developing technological factors."	S_M1
"For instance, although ever-increasing profits, company benefits and pay grades have remained largely unchanged for the past few decades."	B_S0
"Similarly, treatment of workers in many fields has declined as markets have globalized."	I_S0
"A particularly example of this trend is the programming industry, wherein workers are pushed to work 100 hours per week for months at a time."	I_S0
"Many people have found that working at home is simply more convenient and allows them to be more productive thanks to the internet."	I_S0
"Rather than having to travel to have meetings, self-employed workers can have video conferences with their clients and keep in constant communication from the comfort of their home."	E_S0
"The convenience of working from home comes at a price."	S_M1
"though."	B_S1
"Without the networking that takes place at an office, professionals who wish to advance their careers, or rely on connections to perform their duties must find new ways to meet new people and clients."	E_S1
"to conclude, the phenomenon of greater numbers of people becoming self-employed is likely due to economic incentives and the advanced internet."	S_C2
"However, those who wish to be their own bosses must be willing to accept the limitations that come with being a company of one person, including fewer resources and difficulty in securing clients."	S_S2
 
"Today more and more persons begin to be self-employed and refuse to work for a company."	S_T0
"I  think it is a normal phenomenon."	S_T1
"Self-employed system has more room for development due to without anyone controlling your ideas."	S_M1
"In comparison to working for a company, which has determined targets and tasks every day, self-employed system has more potential chances."	B_S1
"For instance, people can create their  own brand in a specialized field and lead their team to introduce it to the market,putting aside more money than working for a company since your boss will take a extremely large proportion of not only your achievement but also your profit."	E_S1
"Self-employed system, however, with another engaged benefit, is freedom."	S_M1

"With the advertisements appearing in all aspects of our lives, there is a view that people are losing their individuality because they see the same advertisements and buy the same goods."	S_I0
"In my opinion, there is no doubt that advertisements will influence people's decision making in daily consumption."	S_M1
"As advertisements appear in every corner in our life，such as TV, Internet and supermarket, people are likely to be so motivated to buy that they lose their judgment."	B_S0
"In addition, advertising generally sells new products, and the pursuit of new products and new trends is what everyone will do."	I_S0
"That's the reason why people like to go after the new products."	E_S0
"However, as people pay more attention to showing their personal character."	S_M1
"Many businesses also offer personal services，which people can tell the businesses what they like before they buy the goods and let them design according to their preferences."	B_S1
"People can make different changes on the standard goods according to their preference，it could enlarge the difference between the products."	E_S1

"From my point of view,although this situation would bring some negative influence,the positive development outweighs the disadvantages."	S_T0
"To some extent,it is true that the developed technology has affected relationships between people in many ways."	S_M1
"Firstly,people use phone to contact with their friends while in the past,people used to meet others face to face."	B_S0
"For example,there are some useful applications in our phones which enable people to chat and even have a video call with friends conveniently,such as WeChat,and people no longer need to spend time to meet others."	I_S0
"Secondly,there are also some websites which could provide a place to let people study online while people usually should go to school to study before and people can choose vary teachers as their own teachers."	E_S0
"As the developed technology,there are some positive and few negative effects."	S_M1
"On the one hand,some people would be alienated from friends or family and they seldom meet others because of the convenient social software."	B_S0

"As the different family may have different ways to educate children, the question whether parents should let childre make mistakes so that they could learn from their own mistakes is a highly debated one."	S_I0
"Some people contend that letting children make mistakes is not a good way because the children should not face with too many difficulties in that young age, otherwise they are easy to be upset."	S_T0
"However, as far as I am concerned, it is significant for children to meet problemd directly and independently."	B_T1
"In this way, they can be more persistent in the future and they will remember the experience forever."	E_T1
"Above all, children will learn to be diligent and persistent when the parents let children make their own mistakes."	S_M0
"As an old saying goes, nothing in the world is impossible if you set your mind to do it."	B_S1
"During the process when children make mistakes and draw experience from it, they will gradually understand the meaning of the saying above."	E_S1
"Moreover, it is sure that children will remember it forever if they learn from their own mistakes."	S_M0
"For example, my parents just let me make mistakes when I was in a young age."	B_S0
"I was addictive to the video games at that time, but my parents never said anything about it."	I_S0
"However, after an important examination, I found that my grades were so bad that I dare not tell these to my parents!"	I_S0
"Finally, I understood that the video games were just the obstacle in the way to success and I tried my best to remove myself from the games."	I_S0
"It was not easy but at last I succeed in doing it and I will never forget the miserable process."	I_S0
"Thanks to my parents, their special way of education helped me a lot."	I_S0
"They let me make mistakes and let me learn from it on myself and I will remember it forever that I should not be addictive to anything."	E_S0
"Admittedly, children may be upset if they make mistakes and their parents do not help them."	S_M0
"However, when children realize that they should face the problem on thier own, they tend to be effective and persistent."	B_S0
"It will leave them deeper impression after they solve the problem on themselves and learn from the mistakes."	I_S0
"As a result, the disadvantages of being upset are outweighed by the benefits of their learning from the mistakes."	E_S0
"To sum up, it is better for parents to let the children make mistakes."	B_C1
"Although this way of educating their children seems to be sort of strange, it is effective and it will pave the way for children's brilliant future."	E_C1
 
"Recenty, there are two points of views about foreign language learning."	B_I0
"One part of them believe "The earlier The better", the students should start from primary school."	E_I0
"The other point of view shows their opposite ideas, they identify that it is not late to gain the knowledge of foreign language since secondary school."	S_T1
"According to some academicians, one of the major benefits of introducing young people in an early age is that it helps childern gain a higher level of proficiency."	S_M1
"As a result, they could be more confident to verbal their ideas using the language they learnt."	B_S0
"Confidence of using the second language is one of the essencial matters for their oral speaking."	I_S0
"Another benefit of learning the additional language in an early age is that it could be such an advantage for their cognitive skills."	I_S0
"Saying from the serious studies, the multiliguals are smarter than the monoliguals."	E_S0
"When it comes to the potencial disadvantages of learning from primary school, students could be confused about the differences between the foreign dialect and their native tougue."	S_M1
"Therefore, they might be slower to aquire the fluency of theire mother tougue."	B_S0
"For instance , it is normally to notice that children born in the bilingual family have diffculites in conversing the two different language."	I_S0
"But in my point of view, it would be easy to conque that because of the learning from their parents."	I_S0
"Another problem of adding the new language to the primary curriculum is that it put an extra burden on  the yound people."	I_S0
"Nowadays, there are quite lots of subjects to learn and a new language can make the sllybus even heavier."	E_S0
"In conclusion, educating children to be a biligual peole would promotes them better language skills and higher IQ."	B_C1
"And teachers and parents should be concious that the new language would not be another burden for the kids."	E_C1
 
"With the development of the society, people's living habits are gradually changing."	S_I0
"The most obvious point is that most young people are no longer relying on their parents when making decisions."	B_T0
"They are making decisions and are more likely to rely on themselves."	E_T0
"Today's young people are better educated than in the past, which gives them a broader vision and deeper insight into the world."	S_M0
"As a result, they tend to make decisions based on their own ideas and judgments."	S_S2
"With the boom in the economy and the Internet, today's young people are more likely to enter the global community and place a high value on the freedom to express themselves, which is adored by young people in many countries and inspires many young people who are less respected."	S_M0
"For example, a report investigating the independence of students found that only a small percentage of students were determined by their parents or teachers."	B_S0
"But now most students are independent."	I_S0
"They listen to their parents, but in the end the choice is up to them."	E_S0
"Another important reason is that the experiences of some adults have little impact on our generation, because conditions in the information age change so quickly."	S_M0
"In the past, young people were less likely to leave their hometown, but now we usually move from one place to another."	B_S0
"So parents' ideas may no longer fit our situation."	I_S0
"Therefore, we prefer to make decisions based on our own experience."	E_S0
"In sum, for the reasons I mentioned above, I totally agree that in contemporary society, we young adults are better able to make choice on our own."	S_C2
 
"I agree this viewpoint."	B_T1

"Then a heated discussion is raised aboubt whther economic progress ia the most important goal."	S_T1
"From my perspective, other progresses are also important."	S_T0
"Firstly, the progress on other fields garantee the safety of the residents."	S_M1
"To be more detailed, the progress made by the country in military and the level of diplomacy would prevent the happening of a war and gives the residents a insurance that they would not be treated with inequility, owing to the fact that those progresses are the lucid demonstration of the strength of a country."	B_S0
"In contrast, the progress of economy is not so much of a improve in economic state as a sign that attracts higher tariff and quota."	I_S0
"Other countries would use measures to limit the country with a significant progress of economy, making the residents even more suffer from the increase of the cost of traveling abroad and the bias from foreginers."	I_S0
"Other progresse seemed yto be outweigh than economic"	E_S0

"Some of them consider that increasing the sports centres is the best way to improve public health,while the opponents say that it has only little fact on their health,and other measures would contribute to public health."	B_S0
"Personally,it could have both negative and possitive consequences in equal measure."	I_S0
"To begin with,it is true that buliding more sports facilities has certain benefits."	I_S0
"Because of this measure,people do not have to wait for limited facilities,which saves much time and encourages more people to do exercise."	I_S0
"What is more,it greatly improve their physical quality,since they need to stretch their whole body which is beneficial to lung capacity,strength and flexibility."	I_S0
"Besides,it also has positive effect influences on mental health."	I_S0
"Since they spend much time on doing exercises instead of staring at the cell phone all day,which is harmful for their eyesight."	I_S0
"Admittedly,increasing the number of sports facilities has little effect on specific group."	I_S0
"People,especially the businessman,have no spare time for relaxation,which means that the sports facilities do not attract them."	I_S0
"In addition,some low income groups do not want to spend much on the fees of doing exercise."	I_S0
"By contrast,they would rather spend time at home,like yogam,which is much cost-effective."	I_S0
"Last but not least,forming a balanced is also a good measure to be healthy,reducing the risks of obesity and even heart disease."	I_S0
"To sum up,the rising number of sports center is not always the best way to improve public health,beacause some group of people have less time to utilize the facilities,whom would desires other methods to exercise."	E_S0
 
"It is widely acknowledged that technology is developing,which bring people a lot of benefits."	B_I0

"That makes we under a being watched atmosphere."	I_S0
"It is so disquieting."	E_S0
"The second reason is the camera will replace police sometimes."	S_M0
"When a accident happened,the police will hand out at first time instead of security cameras."	B_S1
"Besides,some personal cameras in the hotel will record everyone's privacy and criminals make a lot of money by selling the video."	E_S1
"Despite of these,I believe that the use of the camera in security is a positive measure."	S_M0
"This action through government is thinkable."	B_S0
"It could monitors every cars as it passes the traffic lights,which to prevent further traffic accidents."	I_S0
"And,the cameras may become the important evidence to keep evidence of the criminal's crimes."	I_S0
"For example."	I_S0
"After a criminal commits a crime, a lot of security cameras can be done to record the criminal's appearance and the direction of his escape."	I_S0

"however, I think parents definitely should let the children make and learn from their own mistakes."	S_T0
"and I will illustrate that by stating the following reason."	S_S2
"First of all, kids will not born with the concept what is right what is wrong, and the environment that they spend their time through childhood is the factor that defines who they are, like their habits, their personalities, and their skills."	S_M0

"But what interesting is that the kids 4years old kid actually start behaving like a dog, and he survived because the dog provides the shelter for the kid."	I_S0
"As a consequence, he behaves more like a dog."	I_S0
"Lucky, the kid was funded by the polices, how adopted by foster parents."	I_S0
"And as this story shows the kid learn from their surroundings."	E_S0
"And second, youngster make mistakes, and as human, we all make mistakes no matter who we are."	S_M0
"It's ridiculous not to allow the kids to make mistakes."	B_S0
"To illustrate that, a very famous congressman, he donates money to a lot of hospitals, and start a program that eventually helped a lot of homeless people."	I_S0
"No one would know he was behind bars when he was younger."	I_S0
"Like most of the other problem teenagers, he drinks alcohol, and abuse drugs, and even distribute it."	I_S0
"but those are not important, the most important is that he learned his lesson, and he turns out to find."	I_S0
"most of the people, even so-called success people makes mistake, there is no point don't let kids make mistakes."	E_S0
"But sometimes, make mistake is not a good thing, it may destroy your future if the congressman didn't learn from his mistake, how to know what he will be today."	S_M0
"there is a reason teacher, parents and even the justice system exists, they give hope to other people, to guide they learn from their mistakes, and that is the most important thing."	S_S2
"To wrap up, parent absolutely should allow kids to make and learn from their mistakes, we all are human, we make mistakes, and the most important thing is we learn from them."	B_C1
"That process makes us a better person."	E_C1
 
"The reading passage mainly mentioned about the possible suggestion about the unknown writer of a famous poem called 'Winter Sorrow', and the article suggested some of the possible peolpe who may write this poem."	O
"The First paragraph cited a past viewpoint to a person who called Jean de Havre, an early 14th century  knight-poet ."	S_M0
"The reason why they suggest about this person is because this guy had the experience about the jounal across Normandy which have been writened and described in the poetry."	B_S0
"Moreover, the chracteristic of the poem have some significant 'J' writed, and combined with the habit of Jean de Havre,who always like to take his names abbreviation , which is 'J', as the signature, it seems to be resonable for the people announced him as the possible'elector'."	I_S0
"Howevre, in the listening, the professor even though not directly against this suggestion, he proposed that there could be someone who may have some speical weird hobby, and insert 'J' into his poetry, so the result can br that accurate."	E_S0
"Second suggestion mentioned in the passgae are the view that the Hugh of Brest is this actual writer of the poem, as the content and detail of the "winter sorrow" is quite similar to the poem writen by the Hugh of Brest, all about the Normandy somehow in pieces."	S_M0
"In contrats, the professor proposed that virtually no matter how the similarity in the sources used in the poetry are the same, the style , the tense and language used in the poetry are different ."	B_S1
"Take the example proposed in the lecture, first according to the Hugh of Brest's wrotting, he was recognized as a lover of the past tense who always used it during the writing as the poem in the books are not."	E_S1
"The Third suggestion mentioned in the reading are the point that the anthology was taken and bonded from different pieces taken from the different poet by the unknown editors."	S_M0

"When children keep their eyes on those good sides and it is gonna be really beneficial for them to form a healthy characteristic and behave well in reality."	B_S0
"There could be a lot of things that they do not understand at the moment."	I_S0
"But adult will help them to have a better comprehension rather than getting tricked."	I_S0
"As a matter of fact, many of my friends have grown up under this kind of circumstances and I can feel that they have learned a lot from the all the information they can get."	I_S0
"Their behavior is modified by the things shown on the television."	I_S0
"In the meantime, their parents give them enough guidance to make sure they behave and mimic in the right way."	E_S0
"On the other hand, despite the fact that there could be a lot of unexpected information and  pictures that are not good for the children's development,  people around them would instantly point out the negative effects."	S_M1
"In this way, children barely have the chance to be affected by those inappropriate information and they will learn their lesson and try to stay away from those."	B_S0
"Nowdays internet is filled with things that can bring negative effects on children."	I_S0
"But most of them would try to ignore and keep their focus on the good side."	I_S0
"As a result, they can always behave better when they learn something from the moveis and television."	E_S0
"With these two main reasons above, I strongly hold the opinion that social media such as movies and television can have more positive effects than negative effects on the way young people behave."	S_C2
 
"It is universally acknowledged that good tourism industry can bring a considerable fanancial income to cities and facilitate the city's prosperity, so decisions on how to improve the city to attarct tourists should be carefully choose by goverment."	B_T1

"My viewpoint is supposed by reasons below."	E_T1
"Renewing those old buildings and street to highlight their distinct and unique style can be a important attraction to tourists."	S_M2
"Although those old buidings and streets have contained part of the city is character which shows its culture,"	O
 
"Currently some parents encourage their child to compete with contempraries because they believe it is a great way to make chidren become more useful."	S_T1
"But some others argue cooperate is a more suitable method."	B_S0
"Personally i agree the first view and i will interpret the rasons."	I_S0
"It is true that many adults was tought that competition was a right way to solve some difficult problems."	I_S0
"But some people may only want to achieve objects through others' efforts rather than their own efforts."	I_S0
"For example,there are three children in a group, and one of that has bad grades, and the others grades are good."	I_S0
"Every time the group achieved the goal through the good children' efforts."	I_S0
"While the bad grade child only need to pay a little efforts or does not even do anything."	I_S0
"Comsequently the good children may become more br=etter because they study hard for achieve goal."	I_S0
"And the other one may keep the level because he did not study hard."	I_S0
"However,adult encourage children comete with contempararies which can imprive their personal ability."	I_S0
"For instence,a child need to achieve a goal ,at the same time another one need to achieve the same goal too."	I_S0
"They will pay more efforts rather than others'assistance for win other one."	I_S0
"The process will make the gain more knowledge and experences,at the same time children' independent thing ability is improved."	I_S0
"Also solving problems independently can put children into the process of solving problems and not be affected by other people."	I_S0
"In my opinion,the more you give away,the more you gain back."	I_S0
"Competition is a great way to stimulate children to become more efforts and they will grow more quickly."	E_S0
 
"There is a hot issue about the choice  of money consuming on transportation."	S_I0
"In many cities, high-speed rail is welcomed by many people because it has shorten time durng travelling,and they believe that  the government should spend  much money into such railway lines,while many others think  that the money should go to existing public transport."	S_T1
"Supporters of building high-speed rail argue that new railway lines can help save commuting time."	S_M1
"As house prices rise and cities expand, more and more office workers live far away from the company."	B_S0
"This greatly facilitates people's travel and commute."	I_S0
"If there were not such high-speed rail, it is impossible for  them to commute in and out of the city every day."	I_S0
"Therefore,A considerable investment in the construction of high-speed railway lines is needed."	E_S0
"However, there are many people  against the above opinion,and they think the funds should go to existing public transport."	S_M1
"One major reason is  that  the current development of public transportation is not good, for example, the convenience of the subway is not perfect and the bus is often crowded."	B_S0
"If the government can invest money to improve the current traffic situation, then people's life satisfaction will also be greatly improved."	I_S0
"Another major reason is that the government should take the interests of most people as the priority."	I_S0
"After all, the majority of office workers living in urban areas still account for the majority."	E_S0
"All in all, I suppose  that although there are benefits to some people living outside of the city if high-speed trains are invested, the number of rural population is still relatively low and the improvement of current public transportation needs to be solved more."	S_C2
 
"We can see from the graph,there are four different modes of transport in UK between 1974 and 2002."	S_T1
"And the quantities of goods transported are shown in the graph."	B_S0
"The main mode for transport between 1974 and 2002 is by road, and then by water, thirdly by rail, and finally by pipeline in general."	I_S0
"The goods transported  by road and by pipeline is increasing from 1974 to 2002."	I_S0
"Especially in 1994, we can see obvious changes."	I_S0
"The goods transported by water and by rail is almost steady during this period of time with a little disturbation."	I_S0
"The goods transport mode can reflect the main transportation and     
ecomoic development in UK."	I_S0
"The mode by road is always the main mode."	I_S0
"It is very safe and convinient."	I_S0
"The need of goods is increasing obviously from 1990 to 2000."	I_S0
"We can know the living condition of people is improved or the reconstruction is developed quickly."	I_S0
"In the end, maybe the development of other transport mode is needed to be improved to release the main mode."	I_S0
"And it will do good to ecmomic development."	E_S0
 
"The chart shows us energy consumption from 1980 to 2012 and projected consumption in 2030."	B_I0
"Gasoline and oil were the main sources of fuel during this period, using 35 quadrillion (35q) units in 1980 and rising to 42 quadrillion in 2012."	I_I0
"Despite some initial fluctuations, there has been steady growth since 1995."	E_I0
"The trend is expected to continue, reaching 47q by 2030."	S_T1
"During this period, the energy consumption of natural gas and coal is similar."	S_M1
"From 20q and 15q in 1980, natural gas began to decline, coal gradually rose, from 1985 to 1990, the two fuels are equal."	B_S0
"Consumption has fluctuated since 1990, but both now offer 24q."	I_S0
"Coal is expected to grow steadily to 31q by 2030 and natural gas to 25q after 2014."	E_S0
"In 1980, only 4q of energy came from nuclear, hydro and solar/wind."	S_M1
"Nuclear power grew by 3 quarters and solar/wind power by 2 quarters."	B_S0
"After modest increases, hydropower has fallen back to 1980 levels."	I_S0
"That level is expected to remain unchanged until 2030, with other indicators rising slightly after 2025."	E_S0
"Overall, the us will continue to rely on fossil fuels, while sustainable energy and nuclear power remain relatively unimportant."	S_C2

"I think most people hold the same view with me."	S_T1
"Admitteddly, no matter how hardworking a person  is, he just  be regarded as strangers."	S_M1
"We do not have the obligation to help him to  accomplish his target."	B_S0
"Lots of people may agree with this statement."	I_S0
"Actually , both we are normal person , even though sometimes we have the ability to help strangers, we are afraid of making mistakes which will lead to do harm to the struggling strangers."	I_S0
"What's more, strangers usually would like to realize their dreams by themselves."	I_S0
"However,  the world is complicated, which do not allow us to consider whether to help a person with spirit of 
 trying their best and  taking risks or not."	I_S0
"Therefore, I think prople are more willing to help the struggling strangers as soon as possilble though we only can help a lot."	E_S0
"Moreover, the reason  people today are more willing to help struggling strangers is due to their instinct ."	S_M1
"Consciences or ethical decisions make a great influence on people's mind."	B_S0
"That's because normal people cannot refuse the people who really need sopprots."	I_S0
"For example, when I was a child, I was always willing to help elder people to go through the crossroad ."	I_S0
"Even though sometimes  I think it is time-consuming for me to help them."	I_S0
"Nevertheless, the moment I look at them, I have a sense of feeling that I want to tide them over."	I_S0

"The chart shows the percentage of Australian men and women doing physical activity in different ages."	S_I0
"It is clear that females had higher percentage than males after the age of 24 and male had the highest percentage at the age of 15 to 24."	B_M0
"As we can see, mainly males who aged 15 to 24 do more physical activityies that account for 52.8%."	E_M0
"But, from 35 to 44, proportion of males declined significantly (39.5%)."	B_S0
"However, for males aged 45 to 54,till males aged 65 and over, the percentage of this activism went up to 46.7%."	I_S0
"With regard to females' proportion, the most females were 45 to 54 which accounts for 53.3%."	E_S0
"Moreover, famales were less active than males aged 15 to 24."	S_M0
"It is worth to mention that the number of males and females who are 65 years old and over was nearly the same with 46.7% and 47.1% respectively."	S_S2
"Overall, we can see that the majority of women do more physical activity than men."	S_C2
 
"I think the reason cases of the phenomenen is students don't like this school or there is some teachers they don't like."	S_T1
"Every student like to play games and don't like study."	B_S0
"So teachers need to find the right way to teach student."	I_S0
"But some of the teacher don't do like this."	I_S0
"They teach student by their own way ."	I_S0
"There will always have student argue with them."	I_S0
"So it cause student don't like teacher any more, and they do not have teh thought to study."	I_S0
"As the time goes on, student start to think study is not useful."	I_S0
"The other reason is their family."	I_S0
"Parents never do good sign for their children, some of the parents told to their child after you finish high school you can go to work."	I_S0
"So from their childhood parents use a wrong way to teach them."	I_S0
"It infloence them don't have thought to student and led them against study."	I_S0
"There is a fact, two family have two different kind of parents."	I_S0
"One of the parents have high education, but the other never study."	I_S0
"So the high education family told their child to study hard."	I_S0
"and the other parents told their child to be a worker when he was 18 years old."	I_S0
"Finally the first child become a scientist, the 2ed one escape school everyday and become a low level worker."	I_S0
"I think the way to improve this situation is use the right way to teach children when they was young."	I_S0
"This way may not be very well, but it must let children like this way."	I_S0
"Let student feel happy when they are studying."	I_S0
"Teachers need to do like this, parents too."	E_S0
 
"I agree with the statement that life in today is easier and more comfortable than it was when your grandparents were children."	B_T0
"The reason are in the below."	E_T0
"First, in the past, when they want to connect with each other, people would go to another one's house or make an appointment to meet in a certain place, then they could talk to each other or discuss something."	S_M1
"But in nowdays daily life, we have the cell phones and many social activity applications, like Wechat, QQ, Facebook, Twitter and many more else applications, and we could also have the "face to face" discussion by Wechat, QQ or any other social applications."	S_S2
"Second, in the past, in 19 centry 60th, the people who like my grandparents are lack in the transportations tool."	S_M1
"My grandma says that, in that periord, they couldn't see many bikes and nearly never see the cars."	B_S0
"As her saying, she thinks if they could take the mailman's bicycle from the school to their home, they could feel they are really very happy."	I_S0
"But in nowdays, the shared bikes are in everywhere in our city even the froeign countries' cities."	I_S0
"And there is even also some "shared new energy electric vehicle" in our city."	E_S0
"Third, in the past, if they want to buy some things, they could only go to the stores or shops."	B_C0
"And if they want to buy some foreign things, the man who says these things, it will be called the "Arabian Night" by other people."	I_C0
"But in nowdays, wh could buy some things by the network shops, and you can also buy the f"	E_C0
 
"There a famous saying in ancient China "Two heaads are better than one", it means that teamwork is important than lonly work."	S_I0
"In such a competitive society, people are all paying attention in their children's education, so they may foucus on the childrens working during the class, some parents may know taht their kids is a leader of a study group, other parents may know taht their childden like to study alone, so they may feel uncertain: wroking together and learning alone, which one of them is more effectively."	B_T1
"However, in my opinion,I agree with the first statement because I think working together is a more effective way to learn a projects."	E_T1
"Firstly, working togetheer can help students find their weaknesses."	S_M2
"As everyone know, if a children can't get a good grade, they may have some weaknesses that could not been sovled quickly, and usually they can not find their weaknesses on their own ability."	B_S1
"However, if a boy discribing his problems and sharing his own solution to other students, others may think the solution scrupulously, and if the solution have some mistakes, the boy could know his weakness and make sure he won't make the same mistake in the next test, so working together have a more effect than studying alone."	E_S1
"Secondly, studying in a group can solve many difficult problems that are much harder than the normal problems."	B_C1
"When learning a project, we will usually face many difficult problems, if we are not very smart, and we can't sovle the problems alone, we can asking some friend and creating a smaal group, so you can concentrate all the wisdom into your problem, this way is not only a much efficiency way, but also a useful way that could help you sovle many problems that are very difficult,
Otherwides, working alone also have a few questions."	E_C1
"For example, when you doing your  work at a time of a day, this time  you know that a show that you are very interested is going to play, however your work has last not very much, if you are alone, youmay can;tcontrol yourseflm howevr, if you are in a"	O
 
"In my point of view, the opinion of the essay is more than reasonnable."	O
"If a worker does similar tasks all day long, it will certainly make him or her feel bored."	B_I0
"It's even more unbearable to repeate the sme work day by day."	I_I0
"By contrast, if a worker have various types of tasks to do during the workady, he or she will be not likely to lose interest."	I_I0
"I have a deep understanding of it, since I once worked in a small company."	E_I0
"My experiences are as follows."	S_T0
"Two years ago, I worked as a clerk in an office, which is not very large but quite clowded."	S_M1
"What I did during this period was just write down the information about the product of our company."	B_S0
"When my company sold some products, I needed to note how many it has sold, how much it has got and how much it has earned."	I_S0
"In the begining, I didn't feel bored and felt just good."	I_S0
"But  after two months, I can't wthstand it anymore."	I_S0
"The work made me just like a machine with no spirit, so did my workmates."	I_S0
"Finally, I quitted the job and began hunting for a more inspiring more."	E_S0
"Nearly three months later, I really found what I dreamed of."	S_M1
"I worked as a tutor in a high school, which required various skills."	B_S0
"Sometimes, I talked with some students about their study and helped them find out the solution of their problems."	I_S0
"And there were also times when I was  playing with some students,which was of great significance to me."	I_S0
"I was always trying to find a way to get back to my schoolhood."	I_S0
"One of my dreams was to stay young and innocent."	I_S0
"Staying with students really provided me with such an invaluable opportunity."	I_S0
"Because I could do different kinds of work from talking with srudents to helping teachers prepare the exams everyday, I always felt satisfied."	E_S0
"My exprience tells me that one could do different kinds of work all day long without losing interest,and that one can't bear the simple work if he or she has to do it for a long time."	B_C1
"I believe others are similar to me."	E_C1
 
"I believe this development gives more benifits than drawbacks."	B_I0
"The security cameras helped a lot in a variaty of social problems."	I_I0
"Once the security cameras were used in shopping centre,and roads."	I_I0
"The rate of steeling decreased siginificantly."	I_I0
"Those cameras in shopping centres provided direct evidence and it gave the crimes a mental pressure that make him abundon the thinking of steeling."	I_I0
"The camera in the car also help the police to indicate how an accident happenes,so that it could be easier to make an appointment accordingly to the laws."	E_I0
"It did make the society more safe than before."	S_T1
"Furthermore,The cellphone tracking also help the government to discover the illegal trades in the city."	S_M1
"Every year,there are illegal trades involving drug,cigerette,even young children."	B_S0
"The trade was always involving secret phone call,or through social media,cellphone tracking helps the government to indicate the position of the trade and give missions to military force in order to solve it."	I_S0
"It prevents many people becoming addictive to the drug,and help to find many lost children back."	E_S0
"However,if the technology is used for bad purposes,it is detrimental because it really is hard to be founded."	S_M1
"There are many examples posted on newspapers that some hotels have secret cameras in their room,the customers are monitored without knowing about it,and the video is sold for illegal uses."	B_S0
"It had bad influence in the society which resulted in less and less people choose to go to a hotel."	I_S0
"Goverment had done a lot of job to ensure the hotel has no camera,it took a long time and has had a bad effect in the society."	I_S0
"Though,The influence is getting smaller and smaller because methods of checking whether there are cameras were founded."	E_S0
"As a conclusion,although the techonlogy about monitoring may be used for bad uses,it still gives the government strong ability to prevent illegal actions,and I believe it would make the society safer as it become better and better."	S_C2
 
"These three pie charts clearly describe the changes in the proportion of school expenditures between 1981 and 2001."	B_I0
"There are some features as follows."	E_I0
"First of all, teachers' salaries have remained the highest, never falling below 40 precent."	S_T1
"In contrast, the share of other workers' salaries has been declining year by year, from 28 percent to 22 percent."	B_S0
"In 2001, it was only 15 percent."	I_S0
"Secondly, insurance expenditures grew slowly, from 2 percent in 1981 to 8 percent in 2001."	I_S0
"At the same time, spending on furniture and equipment generally kept rising."	I_S0
"Although it dropped to 5 percent in 1991, it reached 23 percent in 2001."	I_S0
"What's more, the spending on resources fluctuated."	E_S0
"There are reasons behind the data changes."	S_M2
"I suspect that the decline in the share of other workers' wages is related to the general increase in teachers' wages."	B_S0
"Schools may have raised the proportion of teachers' salaries to better retain them."	I_S0
"The change of equipment and resources is also related."	I_S0
"The school may repair and purchase the materials in batches, so the two changes complement each other."	E_S0
 
"In modern society, sporting occasions are given more and more meanings other than encouraging people to be faster, higher, stronger."	B_T1
"I partly agee with the opinion that international athletic occasions are vital to let out patriotic emotion in a safe way and release tensions, yet it is not the sole option."	E_T1
"Events like World Cup gather exceled athletes from all over the world, some opponent teams may come from rival countries."	S_M1
"But the sportsman spirit kept their respectful attitudes towads other team, so many tensions between countries could disappear in the competting field."	B_S0
"On the other hand, sporting events allow citizens to cheer for their country."	I_S0
"The victory of an important game absolutely costs much less than a war, it also lights up the spirit of patroits."	E_S0
"However, not every country has the access to these popular events."	S_M1
"Luckily, other tame methods could be taken to reach the same goal."	B_S0
"In recent years, more and more multi-cultral communication is taking place, builing up strong ties between different countries."	I_S0
"People from China may admire the music from America, the dance from Spain, the opera from France ect.."	I_S0
"All these evidence show that there are many ways to build up friendship between countries."	I_S0
"Meanwhile, citizens feel proud when they find their treasured cultral heritage are also recognized and praised by people from other countries, which will absolutely boost their confidence as well as let out ther patriotic emotion peacefully."	E_S0
"Actually, whether or not the international tensions could be eased eventually depend on how much the political efforts a country made."	B_C1
"All these sporting events or other cultral communications will serve as the golden key to the relationship between countries only when both countries are willing to accept them."	E_C1
 
"The first map present the layout of a public park in 1920 and the second one gives information about the layout today."	S_I0
"In 1920,There was a south entrance and north entrance in the park,and there was a fountain in the middle of the park,the left of the fountain is a stage for musicians,and it was sandwiched between two rose gardens,  the rest of the seat beside the two rose garden,the right of the fountain is a pond for water plants,that is in the upper right corner of the park, there was a another rose garden between the north entrance and pond in the right of the southentrance,there was a glasshouse and seat."	B_M1
"One hundred years later,the fountain in the center of the park has been replaced by a large rose garden with seats all around it."	E_M1
"On the left of the rose garden is a Amphitheatre for concerts."	B_S0
"The original rose garden next to the north exit is replaced by a cafe."	I_S0
"In the place where the pond used to be, there is a children's play area,and behind the chilrden center,there is a water feature."	E_S0
"Overall,the garden in the picture has changed a lot in a century."	S_S2
 
"Nowadays, the childen's education is regarded more and more significant."	B_I0
"Some people think that competion is more important while the others suppose that co-operation plays a more important role."	E_I0
"As far as I am concerned, a sense of competition and co-operation are on the equal state."	B_T1
"It is true that childen should be encouraged to be more competitive."	E_T1
"There is a dramatic inceease of the population in a lot of countries."	B_S0
"Therefore, children will get a better oppotunity in education and job acquisition in the future if they are more outstanding than the others."	I_S0
"Moreover, a sence of competition is one of the best way in children's growth."	I_S0
"It is acknowledged that a child will perform better when they are under a pressure of their classmates."	I_S0
"One the other hand, co-operation is another ability which should be taught to children."	I_S0
"From my perspective, no one can live without other people."	I_S0
"Thus children willl be more likely to succeed if they realize how to co-operate."	I_S0
"Besides it, co-operation is an efficient way to finish a big task."	I_S0
"A School is a small society, if a child has learned"	E_S0
"Inclusion, both a sense of competition and an abilty of co-operation are vital to a child's growth."	S_M2
"Our parents and teachers should pay attention to these two ability's training."	S_S2
 
"It is ture that people are influenced by various factors throughout their lives."	S_I0
"Some say the innate talents and abilities play a major role in affecting people's personality and development, while I believe it is their own experiences that impact themselves."	S_T0
"Admittedly, Research, relating to identical twins, has highlighted how significant inherited characteristics can be for an individual's life."	S_M1
"But whether these characteristics are able to develop within the personality of an individual surely depend on whether the circumstances allow such a development."	B_S1
"it is the experiences we have in life are so unpredictable and so powerful, that they can boost other influences, and there are many research findings to confirm this."	E_S1
"However, I believe the later personal experience is the major influence on a person, it has powerful effects."	S_M1
"the experiences shape our personality and visions, and it is a consistent stimulation that always remind us to grow into the personality that the world wants us to be."	B_S0
"it has same influence on development as well."	I_S0
"we develop according to what we see and learn on a daily basis."	I_S0
"we cannot develop just because of our talents."	E_S0
"in conclusion, i belive nurture plays a more important role than nature considering its effect on personality and developemtn."	S_C2
 
"I think to give a school-age children money for high grade they get in school it is a great way to inspaire children to study harder."	B_T0
"But give money as an reward everytime is not a good way."	E_T0
"My opinions are based on followings."	S_T1
"Firstly,when children have some progress in study,parents can give them some pin money as a reward,that can make childern have more energy to study,but their are many other ways can inspire them ,not only to give money but also can take them on a  trip ,buy a new phone for them or take them for a great meal."	S_M1
"May be children are more think highly of praise from their parents."	S_S2
"Besides , if praents give money everytime when they make progress in studyand childern can get money easily when they need money,that may be will establish  a bad habit in their life ,may be they just use the money randomly ,actually they just don't know how to use the money."	S_M1
"So, in my opinion ,give money is just one way to encourage children to study hard ,but what they really need is  more concentrate from their parents"	O
 
"I support that it is more significant for the goverments to use fund to improve public transportation than to improve Internet access."	B_I0
"First of all, what matters in the human society is the real contacting of each other."	I_I0
"When we talk to our family members, we hope that we can tough them, we can hug, and we can laugh together, not just say some words online."	E_I0
"That can only be achieved in meeting someone in reality."	B_T0
"So we need the public transportation to get to somewhere."	E_T0
"I have to admit that it is convinnient to chat in the internet."	S_T1
"However, there is no warm."	S_S2
"In addition, there are severe problems waiting to be solved in the public transportation in our country."	S_M2
"Every festival, there is a traffic jam in the street, and buses are always extremely crowded."	B_S0
"For instance, in the last Spring Festival, I prepared all the things in good mood and wanted to take the bus to the train station."	I_S0
"Although it costed me a lot of time to purchase the ticket of the train because there were not enough seats for the passangers, what suprised me more is that all the buses are filled with people."	I_S0
"Therefore, I strongly insist that it can't be wait to improve the routes of the buses, fix the broken road, and update the speeding machine of the buses."	I_S0
"These measures all need the money."	E_S0
"Last but not least, individuals need to go out and have a look of natural environments in the current society, especially internet can not figure out everything for you."	B_C1
"There is no doubt that people can be lazy naturally."	E_C1
"They refuse to move to avoid the matters, and think it can save the money and time."	B_S0
"Actually, it's harmful to their health and mood."	I_S0
"They need go out to look around."	I_S0

"Will you spend all you life in the same organisation?"	B_I0
"It's a problem that people have been discussing for a long time but doesn't have a right answer."	E_I0
"Some people want to work for the same organisation during all their working life for some reasons such as they think it is difficlut to make friends with others, therefore they only want to do it once."	S_T1
"And some people may think that when they work for it for a long time, they will have more chance to be a leader or earn more money."	S_T0
"Others say that the longer they work for it, they will love they work more."	S_S2
"But some people don't think so."	S_M1
"They like change, so they will choose to work for different organisations."	B_S0
"When thry find that they don't like their works, their boss, or some other reasons such as age, marraige and so on, they will try to find anohter job."	I_S0

"Firstly,more channels provide enough choices to children,elders and adults."	I_S0
"For examples,childrens like seeing cartoons and elders like to have a look at news."	I_S0
"Operas will meet adult's needs."	I_S0
"Everybody has its own taste on TV shows."	I_S0
"Various channels  like music,sports,travelling stories surely make our life more enjoyful."	I_S0
"Moreover,more channels offer people more chances to learn something new."	I_S0
"For instance,when junior high school students watching TV and changing the channels,they will see some shows they haven't seen before by chance."	I_S0
"This opportunity will enlarge their horizons and make them have a better understaning of the world,society,people relations,nature scenery and so on."	I_S0
"To the contrary,if TV has poor quantities of channels,it is easy to make people feel tired and bored."	I_S0
"It will lead to an ending that less people will choose to watch TV instead of playing games on computers."	I_S0
"The family relations will be not as familiar as before,either."	I_S0
"As a consequence,more channels mean more choices,different tastes,and enough freedom."	I_S0
"It is more necessary to make our life better and it is more important than other negetives."	I_S0
"And if our government can strengthen the supervision,the drop of quality should not be worried."	E_S0
 
"Some people say the parents nowadays prticipate more in their children's education compared with parents in the past."	S_I0
"About the opinion, I can't agree more."	B_T0
"During the development of Chinses society, people gradually realized that technology is the key of competition and improvement not only for countries but also for individuals."	E_T0
"Then natually parents would take more energy to drive their children study hard, hoping that their children can one day become a successful person."	S_T1
"Parents bacame curious about their children's behaviour during school time, so they tend to ask teachers to report the reactions of students on Wechat."	S_S2
"Apart from school time, parents would try their best to train their children."	S_M1
"Auxiliary classes and interests classes are extremely popular in recent years."	B_S0
"Parents usually help their children choose some of the classes, and accompany with them in every schedule in weekends."	I_S0
"Some of the parents would learn the knowledge or those skills thmeselves, in order to teach their chirldren after classes."	E_S0
"Anyway, parents surly care their children's education more than before."	S_M1
"And I believe that this trend  would keep for a long time."	S_S2
 
"The problems of public health are becoming increasingly serious with the development of modern society."	S_T0
"Some people believe that the best solution is building more sports facilities,while others argue that this is not helpful and there must be better methods."	B_S0
"In my opinion,sports facilities and other measures are equally effective."	I_S0
"On one hand,sports facilities can play an important role in the improvement of public health."	I_S0
"Modern people are more stressful and busier because of the increasingly competitive working environment,so most of them may have no spare time for exercises, which is because they spend most time on  work and socializing with others,and this may cause cardiovascular diseases such as heart disease."	I_S0
"Therefore,building more sports facilities may be convenient for residents to do regular exercises like playing basketball on baskteball courts,or swimming in public swimming pools."	I_S0
"Most people do not do these activities just because they lack these facilities near their residences and workplaces."	I_S0
"On the other hand,many measures are also helpful for public health."	I_S0
"One of them is improving food safety."	I_S0
"Many kinds of food,especially vegetables,contain harmful materials such as pesticides and fertilisers which can cause a range of diseases,because manufacturers want to avoid loss and make more profit."	I_S0
"Therefore,the government should introduce laws to limit or forbid the usage of these materials in food production."	I_S0
"Another way is developing medical cares."	I_S0
"In many countries,cancer and leukemia can be cured by replacing some organs of patients because of advanced medical technologies,which means residents in those countries are healthier and can prolong their lives."	I_S0
"In conclusion, I believe sports facilities and other methods are equally helpful for public health."	E_S0
 
"There is a wide concern about the environment problem recent years."	B_I0
"Some experts insist the view that the priority reason is the losing specials of plants and animals."	I_I0
"Others hold the point that problem should be caused by any other problems."	E_I0
"Personally,I am in favor of the latter point."	S_T0
"Admittedly,there are myriads of reasons can prove  the mainly environment problem is losing plants and animals."	S_M0
"The most apparent one is the quality of soil become worse."	B_S0
"Mainly because it fail to get fertilizer from the creature."	I_S0
"As a result, farmer can hardly use the ground effectively to plant food and it also post threat to the human's life."	E_S0
"However,solving this condition may fail to fix the problem such as air pollution as well as water pollution,and will lead to a worse situation if public ignore the influence of them."	S_M0
"Hence, Government need to make action timely to reduce the problem like water pollution."	B_S0
"For example,they can establish the relavate law to enterprises and factories to regulate the waste chemistry materials,and limitation the hazardous water to be released into river."	I_S0
"Thus,it can forbid the bacteria be detrimental to both human being and other creature on the Earth."	E_S0
"There is another thing that post threat to environment is air pollution."	S_M0
"The oxide on Earth is reduce during these years."	B_S0
"This is priority because the development of industry and the waste carbon which is released by car."	I_S0
"In that case, Government should manage and limit the amount of private car and complete the public transportation in both rural and city."	I_S0
"The scientists can try to invent a new power to use on the transport as well as factories."	I_S0
"Hence,in can be conductive to creatures to live under the fresh air."	E_S0
"In conclusion, I insist that the main reason  to cause the environment problem is water and air condition."	B_C1
"Only we improve these condition can we finally bring positive contribution to protect our environment."	E_C1
 
"Nowadays,much more attention than ever before has been paid to traffic and pollution problems."	S_T1
"Some people consider that higher petrol price is the best way to solve it."	B_S0
"Personally,i do not agree with them."	I_S0
"Firstly,it can not reduce the petrol use totlly."	I_S0
"For example,some car user would still drive when they need to go somewhere else,because they can afford the ga price."	I_S0
"what is more,people do not heve better energy choices."	I_S0
"Although some clean energies such as wind power and solar power are developping recently,it is still not popularized in daily life."	I_S0
"So people preffer to use petrol."	I_S0
"There are some other solve traffic and pollution problems."	I_S0
"For one thing,government should encourage residents touse replaceable sources,giving them financial supports when they buy clean energy."	I_S0
"For another,people should use public transports as much as possible."	I_S0
"For instant,buses,subways and railways can help to reduce environment pollution."	I_S0
"And trafic jams can be soveled to some extent."	I_S0
"In conclusion,higher petrol price can not reduce the use of petrol entirely."	I_S0
"And petrol is still a generic choice nowadays."	I_S0
"In order to solve traffic and pollution problems,government can give supports and peaple can select public transport."	E_S0
 
"In contemporary society, the advertisement is becoming an inevitable trend for people to decide whether to buy this product."	S_T1
"Meanwhile, whether it encourages bulk purchases than the production of quality goods remains a controversial issue."	B_S0
"Personally, both of the two kinds of advertising exist and cater for different consumers'needs."	I_S0
"Many kinds of advertising nowadays clearly encourage large purchases, in particular through offering consumers such deals as 'get two, one for free', offering large containers at a lower cost, or substantial discounts for purchasing several of the same products at once."	I_S0
"Such items could include everyday household goods, washing powder for example, or items that are regularly consumed more than one at a time, such as cans of drinks."	I_S0
"In fact, many enterprises successfully specialise in supplying goods in bulk to consumers."	I_S0
"The idea is  that people will consume more quickly if they have many of the items at home rather than having to go out and buy the items individually every time they need it."	I_S0
"On the other hand, some products are naturally not available for bulk purchase."	I_S0
"This is especially true of items that are particularly expensive or items that a person is unlikely to change for new ones in a relatively short period of time, such as cars and houses."	I_S0
"Advertisements for such products are more likely to stress the quality than its price, since most people will not simply go for the cheapest one, but for one that meets their expectations in other ways."	I_S0
"In a nutshell, I believe that advertisers should take the market for their products into consideration when advertising and decide accordingly whether they should wish to focus on selling in bulk or on competing on the basis of the quality of their products."	E_S0
 
"The access routes to a hospital in 2007 and 2010 are shown in the upper and lower maps respectively."	S_I0
"It is clear that the ring road surrounding the hospital itself was largely unchanged between 2007 and 2010."	S_M0
"However, the transport infrastructure was considerably upgraded, most notably with the addition of two roundabouts, and the expansion of the car parking and bus facilities."	S_S2
"With regard to the ring road, the only change seen in 2010, compared to 2007, was the construction of a roundabout in the centre of the southern section, in place of the original T-junction with Hospital Road."	S_M0
"At the other end of the same road, a further roundabout was built at the location of the crossroads with City Road."	S_S2
"In 2007, the hospital was served by six bus stops on Hospital Road, with three on each side."	S_M0
"By 2010, these stops had disappeared and had been replaced by a bus station to the west of Hospital Road, with access to both roundabouts mentioned above."	S_S2
"In 2007, there was only one car park, which stretched the full length of the east side of Hospital Road, with a single access point in the south-east of the ring road."	B_C1
"By 2010, this had become a car park for staff only and a further car park for public use only had been constructed, to the right of the eastern section of the ring road."	E_C1
 
"Nowadays more and more people pay attention to children's education in early age."	S_I0
"Some hold the opinion that punishment is necessary but others disagree."	B_T0
"From where my stand, I think punishment is important to educate kids, but it is not necessary."	E_T0
"In my opinion, kids always are innocent for errors."	S_M0
"If  everytime they make mistakes  we punish them, it will do harm do their heart and live them a bad memory in their childhood."	B_S1
"What's more, parents' anger is harmful for child's characteristic when he grows up."	E_S1
"The most important reason I disagree about punishment is parents can not hold a proper way."	S_M0
"Usually they choose body punishment."	B_S0
"And once they beat their children, there will be the twice and so on."	I_S0
"It is probably to develop to family violence."	E_S0
"Instead punishment, I believe that there are more useful and mild actions to teach children."	S_M0
"For example, we can give oral warn to avoid the second mistake."	B_S0
"And we can take others measure to tell kids the difference between right and wrong."	I_S0
"The most important thing is that parents should take theirself as model."	I_S0
"Children love to imitate them, then they can learn to behave well."	E_S0
"In general, I hold the belief that if parents take their childrens' future into consideration, they should try to avoid body punishment instead of oral education."	B_C1
"In all aspects it is better for childrens' behavior."	E_C1
 
"Nowdays, there is a kind of phenomenon that children are receiving money from their parents."	S_I0
"I often hear from the disagreement to this fantastic idea, for they think children are too young to own money."	B_T0
"Indeed, they should not possess much money, but they can benefit, if they gain little money for high grade."	E_T0
"Thus, I prefer to agree with the good idea that parents can offer their school-age children money for high mark."	S_T1
"First of all, children will be encouraged if they receive rewards like money."	S_M1
"During teenage, children are at the time when they are willing to study for the interest."	B_S0
"Imaging that if a child always gets the best grade in his class, but receives no rewards or the ones that do not fit him, what will he feel, and what is the motivation for him to continue to study hard?"	I_S0
"Parents are always considering that they understand their kids enough, but the fact is that parents merely know what the kids really need, because the choices of themselves are something they really want."	I_S0
"Therefore, it is better to give their money to buy what they really want instead of giving nothing or making the choices by parents themselves."	E_S0
"Moreover, giving the money to the kids can help children develop the ability of financial control."	S_M1
"One day, children will become adults, so they will face the problems that how to earn money and how to save money."	B_S0
"If parents give the money to children as the prize, they will regrad these money as something they earn."	I_S0
"As long as parents teach them some financial skills, they will cultivate a good view of money."	I_S0
"Since only after experiencing the difficulties of earning money, children will understand how important to save money, and this virtue will help them become successful."	E_S0
"To sum up, although giving money to the children as rewards will bring some disadvantages, there are more benefits than we normally expect."	B_C1
"It is compelling that if parents and children carry out this behavior in a right way, children will derive tons of advantages in their future life."	E_C1
 
"TV channels' problem"	S_S2
"Nowadays, people can see more and more channels on TV."	S_T0
"Simple as it is, what the phenomenon conveys to us is thought-provoking."	S_T1
"It reminds us that we should pay attention to the TV channels' problem."	S_S0
"Opinions varys when it comes to the TV channels' problem."	S_T1
"Some argue that having more TV channels is good because they will have more choices."	B_S0
"WIth the development of the TVchannels, we can get more information from the news and other programs."	I_S0
"People can choose to watch whatever they like and they are satisfied with the supply probably."	I_S0
"However, those who strongly oppose are not among the minority."	I_S0
"They hold that too many TV channels only leads to lots of poor quality TV programs."	I_S0
"We can see that some channels' programs provide little resources for us and they just try to attract the public with less valued news or stories."	I_S0
"Even it do harm to the teenagers."	I_S0
"Given the factors I have just outlined, it can be concluded that the question depends on personal choice."	I_S0
"From my perpective, we need to provide more TV channels which are high quality for people."	I_S0
"The number and quality should be stressed at the same time."	I_S0
"People want to the programs that will really benefit for their lives rather than some poor news."	I_S0
"In some rural area, the TV is the only ways for them to the outside world."	I_S0
"And it is also essential for people to know the world what happens from more TV channels."	I_S0
"So we cannot drop each of them and we need to emphasize both of them."	I_S0
"More and more TV channels enrich our life and the high quality TV programs need to be showed for the public."	E_S0
 
"With the living standard in our normal lives improve a lot, people ger more and more chance to travel outside during their leisure time."	S_I0
"I found that many prople who close to me prefer to travel in our own countries and they give me some reasons to support their own idea."	S_T0
"As you know that our country have a long history so that you could learn lots of culture sediment."	S_M1
"In my opinion, People should get access to study their domestic culture and travel is a good method to develop it."	B_S0
"When you reach to a new place, according the delicious food and famous eyesights, you may extend your knowledge width even you will enjoy it at the same time."	I_S0
"Also throughout the local guide explaining and what you see by yourself, the express you receive may impressive and memorable."	I_S0
"It is easier to render more knowledge than learn foreign culture because you have already understand a little."	E_S0
"In addition, As a domestic citizen, We have the obligation to know our culture clearly."	S_M1
"When your foreign friends come your country and ask for the local culture, it may become a embrasses moment when you can't answer their questions."	B_S0
"That is really shame."	I_S0
"As a result, After you travel lots of  places at your own country, you must have a widh knowledge and you could explain to others without any doubts."	E_S0
"Some people argues that traveling aborad is more intriguing, and what you see may beyond your expect."	B_C0
"However, I reckon that when lots of people travel to one place, Local dweller living condition must improve a lot because tourist will bring many walfare and economic help."	I_C0
"When the consumption at one place enhance a lot, local dweller will get more rich."	I_C0
"Suppose that if you have a trip at a domestic place, it means that your contribution may boost the local economy develop."	E_C0
 
"At present era, there is a phenomenon that an increasing number of car ownership cause the problem of traffic congestion over the past thirty years in the world."	S_I0
"Personally, I assume that the development of human being’s affordability and population are two main reasons for the situation, which will trigger off negative developments."	S_T0
"On the one hand, individuals own the ability to purchase the commodity."	S_M1
"On the grounds that the emergence of more and more related industries, the pressure of competition in the same market is so great that the price has to be lowered to attract buyers, leading to the increasing affordability of buyers, which causes traffic jams."	B_S0
"On the other hand, the world population constantly increase every moment."	I_S0
"On account of mass reproduction of population, it expands population base, leading to testing their driver's license and buy cars for the convenience of travel."	I_S0
"And consequently, it results in traffic jams."	E_S0
"However, there are two measures for the government to solve this type of problem."	S_M1
"First of all, the government can increase the number of lines to improve traffic jams because of the increase of lines, more vehicles can drive more smoothly on the road, which can alleviate the traffic problems."	B_S0
"Secondly, government's propaganda of increasing environmental protection awareness."	I_S0
"The government's strong publicity on environmental protection can make more people have environmental awareness and make citizens reduce the use of private cars so as to effectively alleviate traffic problems."	E_S0
"In conclusion, I am convinced that traffic problems will be effectively improved if the government takes these measures"	S_C2
 
"The bar graph below indicated the amount of carbon emissions in six countries (USA, Germany, United Kingdom, China, Canada and India) during three different years."	S_I0
"It is obvious that USA always released the most carbon dioxide (1220000 thousand metric tonnes in 1975, 1300000 thousand metric tonnes in 1990 and 1600000 thousand metric tonnes in 2005)."	S_S2
 
"Nowadays, technology has changed the way people communicate, with good effects, but also with bad effects."	S_T0
"For example, before the communication is to meet, now the communication is mobile phone chat."	S_M0
"In short, it was slow, it's fast."	B_S1
"That doesn't mean anything, it just means that technology has changed people's lives."	E_S1
"But we can still talk about the pros and cons."	S_M0
"Now life is fast, friendship seems more fragile than before."	B_S0
"Because, you'll reach out to new partners anytime, anywhere."	I_S0
"Although these do not make the friendship between friends disappear, but impact."	I_S0
"For example, people now break up a lot more than they did before, or even countless."	I_S0
"At the same time, the pace of life will soon let you forget a person who is not familiar with but know, even forget  his 
 appearance."	E_S0
"But we know it has its disadvantages, but its benefits are enormous."	S_M0
"For example, you can let separate partners meet online anytime and anywhere."	B_S0
"It also makes distance love better."	I_S0
"If applied, it will not only not miss friendship and love, but also make these stronger."	I_S0
"At the same time, it can also let the deep family can talk to heaven at any time."	I_S0
"What's more, today's technology makes it easier for doctors to communicate with patients, reduces mortality and makes more families happy."	E_S0
"In general, the development of science and technology now has advantages and disadvantages for people's communication."	B_C0
"But it does more harm than good, as we all see."	I_C0
"What we need to do is to try to change ourselves and make ourselves fit with the development of technology, so that technology has no drawbacks in itself."	E_C0
 
"The graphs illustrate changes in a school's expenses in England in 1981, 1991 and 2001."	S_T1
"According to the three charts, it is clear that, on the whole, there were substantial differences in school spending in all three years."	B_S0
"Specifically, the proportion of teachers' salaries started at 40% in 1981."	I_S0
"Then, the figure rose slightly in 1991, peaking at a half."	I_S0
"In the end, it fell back to 45% in 2001."	I_S0
"While a noticeable trend was the consistent growth in the percentage of insurance from only 2% in 1981 to just 8% in 2001."	I_S0
"When it comes to the resources such as books, it  ascended from 15% in 1981 to 20% in 1991, but it dropped to only 9% in 2001."	I_S0
"By contrast, the percentage of furniture and equipment moderately decreased from 15% in 1981 to only 5% in 1991, but with the proportion reaching 23% in 2001."	I_S0
"Overall, it can be clearly seen from the charts that teachers' salaries constituted the largest part of total school spending, while the cost of other workers' salaries and resources such as books was descended."	I_S0
"However, there were upward trends in furniture and equipment and insurance."	E_S0
 
"Never have achieved a consensus on the way to improve  public health."	S_I0
"Some people believe that increasing the number of sports facilities is the best way."	S_T0
"Other hold divers views that  other measures are required."	B_T1
"From my persbective, both views are kind of wright."	E_T1
"Even tough, medical research is difficult, it still is a good way to improve public health."	S_M1
"And what can every individuals support government is funding by paying medical taxes."	B_S1
"Not only will this help the government ease the pressure on research funding, but it will also involve everyone in an issue that matters to them."	E_S1
"However, the governments definitely need to play an significant role in this project."	S_M1
"Firstly, the government has more resources."	B_S0
"That means they have more access to cutting-edge technology."	I_S0
"For example, it is more convenient for the government than individuals and private companies to communicate with international medical research institutions."	I_S0
"What's more, governments have ability to direct the whole research direction."	I_S0
"This allows every fund to be spent in the right place."	I_S0
"The final result is that our ordinary citizens will be benefited faster and more effective."	E_S0
"To sum up, though the governments have the main responsibility, everyone should take part in this activity."	B_C1
"Only by this way can we achieve the initial goal which is aimed at improving public health care and treatment."	E_C1
 
"I suppose that we should attach much greater importance to the quality of TV programs rather than the quantity."	S_T0
"And since too many channels definitely lead to poor quality, it's clear enough which one of them deserves more attention."	B_S0
"I'm going to analyse both sides of views and try to introduce my own experience below."	I_S0
"Some people think having more TV channels is good because they will have more choices."	I_S0
"That's easy to understand; think about in an ice-cream store, when the post shows that there are different flavors such as chocolate, coffee, watermelon or even cucumber, you feel like more willing to spend the money."	I_S0
"And that also explains the phenomenon that nowadays the number of TV channels are growing faster and faster, for the producers - like everyone else - tend to make more money."	I_S0
"However, they'd better take social responsibility into consideration, which I'll talk about in the next section."	I_S0
"Some people think too many TV channels only lead to a lot of poor quality TV programs."	I_S0
"That's a little exaggerate but true."	I_S0
"The reasons are as follow."	I_S0
"First and foremost, we'll digging out why there exist more and more TV channels."	I_S0
"As I said, someone counts on those to feed themselves."	I_S0
"Then, we turn to making commands on such kind of behavior."	I_S0
"No one can be blamed for his desirement of money, while everyone should be responsible for the society he's living in."	I_S0
"Last but not least, we find out a solution to the problem."	I_S0
"We try to reach the balance between quality and quantity, and always pay more public attention to the quality of those TV channels, for that actually has influence on a series of things including children's daily learning and social rais"	E_S0
 
"As the competition  between various goverment was more serious now, in order to develope their country power, some prople think it is the most significant to make improvement in economy, while others hold views on other kinds advance is as important as the economy progress."	S_T1
"For my own opion, I support the second view, which shows it is equal to enhance both other types and economy."	B_S0
"My view can be suported as the following."	I_S0
"It is true that economy is necessary for one country as it is the foundation of all things."	I_S0
"Firstly, the country which is well-situated financially can have abilities to gaurantee its citizens life."	I_S0
"After increasing its economy, It can improve and perfect its welfare system to ensure workers can have a decent salary and satisfacting benefits."	I_S0
"In additon, a country with good ecomic condition can help the country to resis threat from overseas."	I_S0
"Once there was a disaster there, the country can have enough found to solve problems."	I_S0
"However, if a country want to become more powerful, it can not only make economic progress."	I_S0
"Only all aspects improving can help it becomes strong."	I_S0
"For example, it should improve its eduacational system to impark knowledge to young generation because they will take the responsibility to build the country in the future."	I_S0
"Apart from that, technology is also essencail for a government."	I_S0
"Developing its technolofy can help it become more advanced."	I_S0
"Once there was an earthquake or other disasters,  despite of found, a high quality of technolofy can also make a great influence when survive people or rebuild constructions."	I_S0
"In conclution, for a country, economy progress and others are equal for its developing."	E_S0
 
"Nowadays,with the development of society ,the governments has do many police for needs of people."	B_T1
"In my opinion,I think other types of progress are equally important for a country."	E_T1
"Admittedly,when the country only development economic,the government is difficult to management the environment."	B_S0
"For example,development industy are cause greenhouse gas emissions ,which is harmful to people's health."	I_S0
"and industy can pollution the water,it pose a threat to people's diet."	I_S0
"Despite the above arguments,I think it is important to development equally types."	I_S0
"For example ,development transport ,it can facilitate people to travel, it is very convenient for people to travel the developoment of environmental protection can improve people's health."	E_S0
 
"I am very agree that the influence outside the family is more imprtant for the development of children."	B_T0
"My reasons are as follows."	E_T0
"First and foremost,the family can not restrain the child's whole life."	S_M2
"Soonet and later, child will go out and wander,which have a greater impact on them."	B_S0
"We can clearly feel that child who leave their parents to live in boarding school are more self-discipline."	I_S0
"Secondly,child will meet all kinds of people who they can not meet in their own home and that enable them to learn how to communicate with stranger,which has a big impact on children."	I_S0
"Finally,without the parents'favor outside,child can feel the cruelty of society more directly,which will help them to adapt to society earlier."	E_S0
"So I consider that the influence outside the family is more imprtant for the development of children."	S_C2
 
"The content of knowledge that university provides is concerned by lots of people."	S_I0
"In my opinion, the knowledge should be both useful for employment and taught the knowledge itself."	B_T1
"First, one of the function of university is for students prepare their future."	E_T1
"People can learn some skills and knowleges so that they can have an easier life in job market."	B_S0
"They can have more oppotunity than those who does not hold employment skills."	I_S0
"Additionally, it can save students' time."	I_S0
"When people graduate from university, they do not need to spend extra time to learn these knowledge and skills."	I_S0
"However, the corresponding jobs of one subject varies so it is hard for professors to give students specific skills which may be used in graduates' job."	I_S0
"For example, students who study physics as their major have lots of different prospect job like scientist, physics teacher and material development."	I_S0

"The readinglists out three problems to a successful carrying out."	S_T1
"However,the listening offers three solutions to these questions."	B_S0
"First, the reading raises the question that it takes too long to send peopleto Mars, approximately two years and no spacecraft could takethat many loads of food."	I_S0
"Instead, thelistening says this is not a real problem since the astronautscould use hydroponics to grow crop plants in water and foodwill not be an obstacle."	I_S0
"Also, they could grow plants with recyclewaste water and reuse it as clean water vapor, which could bedrunk."	I_S0
"Plus, since all plants do photosynthesis, the astronautscould breathe fresh air released by them."	I_S0

"And I will explant that in the following passage."	E_T1
"First, hiring new teachers can boost up the teaching qualities."	S_M0
"In some schools like mine don't have enough teachers, so one teacher may need to teach multiple class and even two or more different subject."	B_S0
"The teacher needs to teach a large number of pupils, so they are fewer families with their own student which will not be able to provide more cutermon help to the individuals."	I_S0
"And even more, the teacher needs to prepare for the class that is in different subjects."	I_S0
"Putting the staff in that kind of heavy workload can bring down the teaching qualities."	I_S0
"For my own experiences, my math teacher is teaching three different class, and he is always busy in his office, a lot of people ask him questions."	I_S0
"Because he has a lot of homework needs to go through, how ether didn't have times for it, or we got our results really late."	I_S0
"So hiring new teachers can really solve that"	E_S0
"Second, I think it's beneficial for the student to have more teachers."	S_M0
"We all know different people have different personalities, and teachers have different teaching styles as well."	B_S0
"The student can expose and adopt a new teaching style if they have different teachers."	I_S0
"Luke and I are best friends since elementary, and he has a new biology teacher."	I_S0
"The old teacher that he has when 7th grade only likes to scribe an animal or let him look at the picture in the textbook, and he gets very boring sometimes."	I_S0
"But the new teacher introduces the PPT into the class, and now he thinks the biology is very interesting because he can understand the concept easier since it's more vividly."	I_S0
"And as a consequence, his has been getting really good grades at biology."	I_S0
"unlike me, I find a hard time at my university because I don't like my teachers teaching styles."	E_S0
"The last, unlike the past, the technology are advancing at the high pace, we develop more and more teaching equipment so the student can learn better."	S_M0
"The new teaching tools and all kind of facilities are important as well, it's true it can make the student more engaged at the study but I still think it is not as important as a good teacher."	B_S0
"In the past, we still have exceptional students, and a good teacher can turn a boring history lecture into fun classes without the nowadays technologies."	I_S0
"Before our school brings the technologies into the class, our music teacher play the piano to class to let us sing, and that is so fun because we see a real person play a real instrument, and we love it."	I_S0
"But after school pitchers computer, is no need for the teacher play the song when you can just hit the play button on the computer screen."	I_S0
"Therefore we are no longer find music class fun anymore."	E_S0
"To wrap up hiring new teacher can help students a lot, the teachers can pay more attention to individuals, and the students can adopt new teaching styles."	B_C0

"As the first question was not a problem."	S_T1
"Besides, if the local can use those water in the boxes to grow their own vegetables, they would be much likely to take care of those trees, because it's also benifite to themself and help them to held their family to alive."	B_M1
"At last, collect water was not as difficult as they imagine, loads of water had been ignore at past."	E_M1
"If we make a good use of these water, which could been made in a lot of boxes to save those desertification."	S_S2

"recently, there is a statement that the internet provides so much information that creates problems."	B_I0
"as far as i am concerned, the internet provides us a lot of valuable information."	E_I0
"the reasons are as follows."	S_T0
"firstly, for the children who is growing-up, the internet can provides their a lot of information, which provides them a good way to study better and broad their horizons."	S_M1
"the children will meet a lot of question when they study, and it is not enough for them to just have classes at school, the internet can helps them a lot when the meet the difficult works, and though the internet, the will know a lot of things that they don not know before, for example, my litter sister mary, one day she had a difficult problem when she studying, she asked me for help but i had no idea either, then she went though the intenet and found a lot of information about it, the solved the problem in a short time."	S_S2
"secondly, for the adults who is working, the internet is a good place to relax themselves."	S_M1
"with the development of our society, more and more people are under a lot of working pressure, they need some place to relax themselves, while the internet is a good way to relax."	B_S0
"people can watch funny movies or reading books through the internet, what's more, they can releases their working pressure by talking with some people they don't know."	I_S0
"take myself for example, a friend of mine, lucky, we meet each other on the internet, and we always talk about our life or working pressure or some interest things we have through the internet, talking with her make me feel very comfortable and forget the working pressure."	E_S0
"last but not least, for the old peole, the internet can help them make a lot of friends and make their life more convenient."	S_C2

"In additition,they think if i need go to overseas travel,they should have a best foreign language,such as English which it is a international language."	I_S0
"They can communicate with them by themselves."	I_S0
"On the other hand,other people believe that learning a language is only for travel or work."	I_S0
"Firstly,many young people learn a language for go to aboard sdudying."	I_S0
"Similarly,they need to pass the exam to study aboard,they will hard to study foreign language."	I_S0
"Sencondly,they can learn a foreign language by interest."	I_S0
"For exanple,maybe they enjoy foreign star,such as Korea star."	I_S0
"Many young people enjoy Korea music star,so they will learn Korean language."	I_S0
"Beacuse they like,so they will hard to learn a foreign language."	I_S0
"In conclusion,I think learning a foreign language have many reason."	I_S0
"It is not only two reason."	I_S0
"It maybe for study reasons or personal reason."	I_S0
"But it could also be work and travel by learn a foreign language."	I_S0

"After this, the water is transported through the hot rocks to the production well,where the hot water is pumped up to the condenser in the following stage."	I_S0
"Thereafter, the water is condensed to be steam which is used to power the turbin."	I_S0
"Afterward, the generateor is powered by turbine and produces electricity."	E_S0
"Overall, the cold water is used to produce electricity originally by the geothermal energy."	S_S2
 
"Nowadays,some museums get the fee of tickets from vistors when others are free."	B_T1
"It's a common situation,but personally I don't  think its advantages outweigh the disadvantages."	E_T1
"Let me show you some reasons and personal experience."	S_T0
"Firstly,charging for admission lead to the reduction of visitors,and it has a big effect on the public influence,most people will have a bad inpression on the museum."	S_T1
"Next,it's not equal to other museums."	B_S0
"And it loses the social justice."	I_S0
"Well ,there are some advantsges  in the thing,for instance,it will make vistors be more serious when they are visiting the museum,and  it  can increase the income of museum to protect the museum treasures."	I_S0
"But it's not the reason to charge for admission."	I_S0
"Because konwledge is out of price."	E_S0
"In my memory ,in the past time,I visited the local museum with my parents."	S_M2
"That was a epoch filled with poverty,so the museum was free and it had many brilliant artifacts."	B_S0
"I had a nice trip ."	I_S0
"However,the museum changes the pilicy."	I_S0
"It charges for the admission if you are a adult."	I_S0
"And the number of visitors is decreasing."	I_S0
"And it is filled with the feeling of economy."	I_S0
"The museum loses its faith."	E_S0
"so I hope that the museum can stop charging for admission."	B_C0
"it does more harm thing than good."	I_C0
"Indeed，charging for admission will increase the income and it can decrease the national pressure."	I_C0
"But we should keep the warm heart in this a bit indifferent world and keep the words in mind:The value of the artifacts is out of price."	E_C0

"In 1950, the school was a single building located along the main road and to the right of a series of houses."	I_I0
"There was a large playground which was located right behind the school building to the right of some farmland."	E_I0
"Thirty years later in 1980, the houses were replaced by a car park, as well as a new science block, for the school while the old school building was changed into its main building."	S_M1
"The farmland was also replaced by a new sports field, but the playground remained unchanged."	S_S2
"In the last year, 2010, the car park was extended, as a result of which the land previously allocated to the sports field was added to it."	S_M1
"However, about a third of the old playground was turned into a new, yet much smaller, sports field."	S_S2
 
"London has the oldest underground railway systems among the six cities, it was opened in the year 1863, and it is already 140 years old."	B_I0
"Paris is the second oldest, in which it was opened in the year 1900."	I_I0
"This was then followed by the opening of the railway systems in Tokyo, Washington DC and Kyoto."	I_I0
"Los Angeles has the newest underground railway systems, and was only opened in the year 2001."	I_I0
"In terms of the size of the railway systems, London, for certain, has the largest underground railway systems."	I_I0
"It has 194 kilometres of route in total, which is nearly twice as large as the system in Paris."	I_I0
"Kyoto, in contrast, has the smallest system."	E_I0
"It only has 11 kilometres of route, which is more than 30 times less than that of London."	S_T0
"Interestingly, Tokyo, which only has 155 kilometres of route, serves the greatest number of passengers per year, at 1927 millions passengers."	S_M2
"The system in Paris has the second greatest number of passengers, at 1191 millions passengers per year."	B_S1
"The smalest underground railway system, Kyoto, serves the smallest number of passengers per year as predicted."	E_S1
"In conclusion , the undeiground railway systems in different cities vary a lot in the size of the system, the number of passengers served per year and in the age of the system."	S_C2

"The amount of industrial water consumption and domestic water usage were almost similar in 1990."	I_S0
"Both of these water consumptions steadily remained sample until in 1950."	I_S0
"After that, industrial sector consumed water more rapidly to over than 1000 Km3 in 2000."	I_S0

"Parents give valuable present or justr money to their kids that have high mark in school."	E_I0
"In my perspective ,it's reaaly not a good idea."	S_T0
"To start with, giving money to their kids eho have a high mark in subject will encourage them to do better and let kids know that having a gooa grades lead to a sweet and happy life."	S_M0
"Nevertheness,even thogh kids do a good job ,if parents give them mony and they probably by toys and in this way they may lose interest in studying."	S_S2
"consequently,if kids are offered money just because they have a high mark,tey will think mony is too easy to acquire and it's natural to gain money if they behave well."	S_M0
"In this way kids will have a harmful perspective in their young age,and as a result it may let them do everything just for mony."	B_S1
"Probably,in this way kids will lose interest in studying and become less active if they are not given money."	E_S1
"Besides,kids may use this money to do bad things."	S_M0
"For example ,my cousin Lee,he used to be a good students but since he receive money fro his parents, he become overconfident and use this money to buy ciggarete and become a

"Negative thoughts
  Nowadays many students are hates to go to school to study,they thinks the life in the school are very boring and fretfully,all days we should study study and study,we are not have our own time to do ourselves things."	S_T1
"And nowadays' primary or Middle school are have tests every day ,not every students are digestive and absorption the all knowledge from today,so they will not get beautiful grades ,so they will face the criticism from their parents."	B_S0
"Maybe there will have other reasons,such as the argue between friends , the teacher criticism them or they will have too many homework to do."	I_S0
"How to improve the situation,I suggest, firstly the school can increase the tests,the students are have too much stress now,don't make them crazy."	I_S0
"Secondly,the parents should't criticism the students all the time,they had better to bring out facts and reasons,remember to be soft and gentle."	I_S0
"Finally,the parents can advises to increase the homework,I remember when I am a middle school student I always stay up late to finish my homework,result in I always feel tired in the class."	I_S0
"When I am a middle school student,I have to get up at 6：20，and at 6:50 I have to arrive at school,because we have to run in the morning."	I_S0
"and wo have 4 classes in the morning,rest 1 hour in the midnight and have 3 classes in the afternoon and then we have to have a test after dinner,normally we go back to home at 8:00,and we have to do our homework untill 12:00."	I_S0
"The whole day are very busy,also we have to worry about the grade of the test,everyday we are living in the busy,tired and afraid."	I_S0

"Some people think that language barrier adds the difficulty of living and working."	E_I0
"There are also some people hold the opposite opinion that it does not need much time to adapt to."	S_T0
"From my perspective, although people can obstacle language barriers through hard work, there is no deny that unfamiliar languages and lifesyele may influence people in many aspects."	S_T1
"Firstly, bad interpersonal relationship is one of the negative impacts."	S_M0
"Those who have just been abroad may find it difficult to socialise and forge a relationship with local people."	B_S0
"The difference between language probably results in the difference of thinking model."	I_S0
"And owing to culture diversity, people may view the things in different perspective."	I_S0
"As a consequence, those people who go abroad and the local people can not understand each other and build good relationships, which brings those people a lack of belonging."	E_S0
"Expect for the interpersonal relationships, the inconvenience in daily life is also a big problem."	S_M0
"Because those people have to use a new language that is not their mother tongue language, they can not use it frequently and skillfully as they use their mother tongue in daily life."	B_S0
"As a result, it becomed a big barrier to influence the normal life."	I_S0
"If people meet an emergency, they can not tackle the problem in time owing to the unfamiliar language."	E_S0
"It is also true that unfamiliarity of local language may not be a severe problem."	S_M0
"As long as those people abroad can work hard to study it, they can acquire the second language finally."	B_S1
"However, the progress of being adapted to a new language environment takes time and is not easy."	E_S1
"In a word, although the language barrier is able to step over, the negative effects of socializing and living can not be neglected."	S_C2
 
"The table chart shows the change of total number of visitors to Ashdown Museum during the years before and after it was renovated."	S_I0
"The two pie graphs illustrate the stratification of the visitors about the museum during these years from the results of surveys."	S_T1
"According to the table, there was a dramatic rise in the number of the visitors who entered Ashdown Museum from the year before restoraion (74000) to the year after it was refurbished (92000)."	B_S0
"From the two pie grahps, despite there was 5% of the responders answering nothing both in these two surveys, visitor satisfaction increased a lot due to the refurbishment."	I_S0
"The biggest growth of people who felt very satisfied could be noticed from 15% to 35%."	I_S0
"The repliers who felt satified grew from 30% to 40%, ranking first in the second survey."	I_S0
"By contrast, there were obvious recline in the responders who felt dissatisfied and very dissatisfied, accounting for 40% and 10% to 50% and 5% after the renovation respectively."	I_S0

"The average distance of driving cars,taking long distance buses and trains,as well assome other modes has risen."	B_S1
"On the opposite,the distance of walking, cycling and taking local buses has reduced."	E_S1
"With the largest base,the distance of driving cars has grown rapidly to 4806,which is nearly  three quarters of the total."	S_M1
"With more people choosing to drive,the distance of walking and riding has fallen."	B_S1
"Long distance vechiles are more likely to be used than short distance vichiles maybe because people have to travel farther than before."	E_S1
"Totally speaking,with time going by,the economic situation and the lifestyle have changed,causing people more likely to choose cars,trains and so on."	S_C2
 
"Competition and cooperation have always been two poles in education."	S_T1
"Some people think that a sense of competition should be encouraged in children while others belive  cooperate is more important for them."	B_S0
"In my opinion, we should support more cooperation than competition in children."	I_S0
"Indeed, competition can help children grow up in some aspects."	I_S0
"Competitive children are more long to perform better to win others."	I_S0
"It can provide passion and motivation to study in their growth."	I_S0
"Their potential can also be better developed in competition."	I_S0
"Secondly, children can know themselves better by comparing themselves with others."	I_S0
"Through competing with peers they can find their shortages so that their ability will be improved."	I_S0
"Finally, the competition in society is also very fierce, so it is good for children to adapt to the competitive environment as early as possible."	I_S0
"However promoting a cooperative atmosphere among children is more important."	I_S0
"It is necessary for children to develop their communication and cooperation skills beacause these these abilities play important roles in future study and work."	I_S0
"What's more, overemphasize more competition than cooperation will make children pay more attention to how to defeat others rather than improve themselves."	I_S0
"It will also put too much pressure on children, what are harmful for children's future development."	I_S0
"Last but not least, working with friends to achieve success contribute to children's physical and mental health."	I_S0
"Positive feedback on friendly behavior can help children form a friendly, helpful and socially beneficial character."	I_S0
"In conclusion, competition and cooperation are both important links in Education."	I_S0
"But in my view, cooperation is more important than competition."	E_S0
 
"Both reading and listening are aguring over the need of removing dead trees called salvage logging."	B_I0
"The reading discusses three reasons for why salvage logging is necessary."	E_I0
"However, the listening disagrees with these reasons and asserts longer damages."	S_T1
"First, the reading claims that dead trees, which interrput the recovery of forests should be removed to make room for fresh growth."	S_M0
"Nevertheless, the natural progression of trees is with soil."	B_S0
"And dead trees could provide fertile soil for soils."	I_S0
"Without dead trees, soils would be less nurtrient and it would hurt the growth of overall woods."	E_S0
"Second, the reading believes that dead trees which become habitats for harmful insects would damage the healthy, live trees in example of spruce."	S_M0
"Instead, according to the listening, dead trees are situable not only for those insects, but also for birds and other contributors to the normal forest."	B_S1
"If dead trees are removed, those creatures would lack habitats and the ecosystem of forest would be hurt."	E_S1
"Third, the reading raises several economic benefits such as recoverable values of ill trees and employment."	S_M0
"In this case, the listening supposes two rejections."	B_S0
"For the former, only few ill trees are allowed to reuse because some usages of lumber require high-quality wood."	I_S0
"In addition, removing those trees needs expensive transportation such as helicopter."	I_S0
"Plus, sick trees are hard to maintain which increases the storage cost."	I_S0
"For the latter, employing local residents is temperary, and it needs training thus causing training fees."	I_S0
"When salvage logging ends, those works would lose jobs and their original jobs may be replaced, thus leading to increasing unemployment."	E_S0
 
"More Similar, More Harmonious"	S_S2
"With the development of the globalization, countries are becoming more and more similar and people can buy all kinds of goods from all over the world."	S_T1
"In my opinion, this change is a positive development."	S_T0
"First, it demonstrates people from all over the world can buy chaacteristic goods from different regions."	S_M1
"Although these goods are the same, they are the  products that have competitive advanteges in the world."	B_S1
"People can spent the same money on more perfect products."	E_S1
"Furthermore, this is conducive to ethnic communication and cultural transmission."	S_M1
"Buying the same goods proves that people have a tendency to become the same."	B_S0
"It helps people in different places and cultural regions understand each other."	I_S0
"There are positive effect on contributing global peace."	E_S0

"According to the passage ethanol aren't a reasonable replacement for gasoline, but the professor disagrees with that, he uses some evident disprove the idea of the passage."	S_I0
"First of all, the author suggests that the increase of ethanol wouldn't solve the global warming, it is because the ehanol release the carbon dioxide which is a kind of greenhouse gas to the air and it trap the heat."	S_M0
"However,the professor claims that although the using of ethanol release carbon dioxide, this fuel is made of plants that can asorb the carbon dioxide during the process of growing up."	B_S1
"It ends up to the ethanol remove the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere."	E_S1
"Moreover, although the author mentions the production of ethanol would reduce the plants that be used for feeding the animals in the farm, since the ethanol is made of these plants, the professor denies."	S_M0
"He says that people can use the part of plants that the animal didn't eat to produce the ethanol, so not only the animals can hold thair food source but also people are able to produce and use ethanol."	S_S2
"Finally, the author suggests that the ethonal are more expensive than the gasoline."	S_M0
"It is true that the price of ethonal and gasoline for consumer just similar to each other, but it is because the government gives some help to the ethonal producer."	B_S0
"Whereas, the professor argues that in the future the price of ethanol will go down."	I_S0
"If more people use it, the producer will increase the production of ethanol in order to meet the need of consumers, then the ethanol will much cheaper than it is now."	I_S0
"The data shows that, if the need of ethanol in the future is three times of it is now, the price will go down 40%."	E_S0
 
"From the diagram above we can clearly realize that the percentage of various types of transports using the key bridge changed along each stage of time in UK."	S_T1
"Obiviously,the using of private vehicle rise shaply from the 22% in 1965 to 56% in 1985 and arrived at 74% in 2005,which proved to be as three times as that in forty years before."	B_S0
"Besides,we can also find that the proportion of using recreational vehicles decreased swiftly from 56% in 1965 down to 4% in 1985,while it slightly increased to 9% in 2005."	I_S0
"What's more,public transpots vehicles kept similay percentage from 1965 to 1985,netheless it went down to 5% in 2005."	I_S0
"Last but not least,the using of lorries and other commercial vehicles went up steadily from 9% in 1965 to 26% in 1985."	E_S0
 
"From my point of view,it's a good idea that parents could offer their school-aged children money for each high grade they get in school."	B_I0
"The reasons are as follows."	E_I0
"Firstly,offered the money for their high grade,the students will be stimulated to study harder and continually pursue higher grades,which is both of vital benefit for their academic performance and self-improvment."	S_T1
"Take me for instant,if I have the capacity to "earn" extra money by myself especially gain it on account of my strength on study,I will be encouraged to be concentrated more on the school classes and try to be a all-round student,which undoubtedly will assist me a lot on my daily study and shape me to be a dedicated as well as self-arrangement student."	B_S0
"What's more,by setting such kind of goal that I am supposed to seize all possible opportunities to promote myself,to enrich my study experience,to foster my abilities on academic study as well as become a master in my life,I will gain the willpower to overcome all the adversities during my study peocess,to better my capacities,and thus fulfill my personel value,which is be of essential significance for me."	I_S0
"Last but not the least,by arranging the money I got from my outstanding school work,it can also provide me a chance to master the money."	I_S0
"What's more,it is a kind of chance for me to learn to manage my financial resouces and motivate me to find and invest my financial resources,since I have become a college student,and it's time to face the potential difficulities during the time I turly come to the society as a specific individual."	I_S0
"Meanwhile,one thing I want to emphasis is that no pay, no gain, I gain the money because I have paid much attention on my study and shouldered the obligation as a qulified student,thus it's equal for me to gain some payments."	E_S0
"To sum up,as far as i am concerned,it is a practical practice for parents to offer their school-aged children money for each high grade they get in school,given all the profound and rewarding reasons all above."	S_S2
 
"Education is always a hot and important topic because everyone's growth is accompanied with education."	S_I0
"When it comes to how to educate children, some people will say parents should edify their children for everything and put the way for children."	S_T1
"However, from my perspective I think parents should let children learn from their own mistakes."	S_T0
"In this way, children can have a long time impression and they will know they have some defects so that keeping a honest attitude."	S_T1
"First of all, learning from their own mistakes can make a deep impression in children's lives so that they will avoid making the same mistakes forever."	S_M1
"If children improve themselves in this way, the experience of correcting the mistakes will have a profound effect."	B_S0
"For example, when I was a kid, I used to lick my fingers if I have nothing to do."	I_S0
"Then I was ill when I take an important examination."	I_S0
"I was diagnosed with chronic enteritis."	I_S0
"There were so many bacteria in my stomach because of my bad habit."	I_S0
"From then on, I never licked my fingers."	I_S0
"I think it is an important role for my healthy body."	I_S0
"I learn from my own mistake so that I can remember it in my whole life."	E_S0
"Besides, the children can keep a honest attitude if they know they are not prefect."	S_M1
"Everyone can make mistake, even the saint."	B_S0
"Like one of my roommates is very honest, He always note the mistake problems in a notebook and check himself everyday."	I_S0
"He is a very good student and friend with everyone."	E_S0
"Addimittedly, teaching their children directly form their examples can work, too."	B_C1
"I think learn from themselves can be more efficient."	E_C1
 
"Torreya will soon become extinct and some people start to find solution to save the plant."	B_T1
"The professor in the listening disagree with the idea of people in the reading."	E_T1
"Firstly, according to the reading, some people want to reestablish Torreya in the same location."	S_M0
"However, the professor says that this is unlikely to happen."	B_S0
"Because of the climate chages, Torreya are less likely to live in the same place, especially due to the global warming."	I_S0
"Thus, the environment is dry and is not best place for Torreya to live in."	I_S0
"So reestablishing in the original place seems to be unlikely to happen."	E_S0
"Secondly, some people think that they can move Torreya to a differet place."	S_M0
"The professor says that if we move them to a new place, they will spread very quick and influence other trees in the place."	B_S1
"When the tree widely spread, other endangered trees will be disappear."	E_S1
"Thirdly, some people suggest that they can preserve them in research centesr."	S_M0
"The professor argues that the tree in the research center can not survive when they have natural diseases."	B_S0
"Beside, it is impossible to hold a large number of trees in a research center."	I_S0
"Consequently, keeping them in a research center is unrealistic."	E_S0

"The energy of young people in the modern society is limited due to the high pressure of competition from their career place and school."	B_I0
"Besides the pressure from coursework and jobs, the group of young people also has high possibility to get depression, which indicates the emotional illness."	I_I0
"In addition, the increase of growth rate of the aging peopl divers more pressure onto the group of young people, which causes the constraints of their time availability."	E_I0
"Therefore, I agree the statemtns that young people do not have sufficient time to make contribution to their communities."	S_T0
"The first point that I want to emphasize is that the large amount of coursework in school occupies the time of young students."	S_M1
"In the country of both China and the United States, the students from age group 10 to 17 are mandatory to spend at lease 7 hours during the weekdays on their academic studies."	B_S0
"The subject of coursework includes mathematics, English, chemistry, arts and music."	I_S0
"In order to get accepted by young students expected and dream universities, they are required to get excellent or at least level of good on grades from these classes."	I_S0
"Young students will necessary to spend time to do well on each quizzes, homework, assignments and tests."	I_S0
"Besides achieving the outstanding GPA from these subject courses, high school students need to take college placement test SAT and extend extracurricular activities in their college application, like sports and music, which will also take their time."	I_S0
"Therefore, young students are unable to spend most of their time to engage in community."	E_S0
"Not only young students can use to demonstrate my argument, but also those young adults who already worked in the job market will show my statement is convincing."	S_M1
"Young employees in the career place are facing high competition from peer pressure."	B_S0
"Their performance in the job market directly decides their salaries and future career development."	I_S0
"From the perspective of young adults, supporting themselves to live in daily life independently in the society is crucal transition period for them because they would need sufficient financial conditions for supporting their own family in the future."	I_S0
"Furthermore, young adults will also need to be ready for supporting their parents after they retired."	I_S0
"High competition and pressure in the job market of the society are far larger than in the middle and high schools."	I_S0
"There is still possibility of depression happened on those young adults since they will have emotional illness from overloading works."	I_S0
"Thus, from my opinion, young adults in the society are less likely to own sufficient time on making contribution to the community service."	E_S0
"High pressure from coursework towards young students and competition from career place towards young adults will cause the constraints of time on helping to the community."	B_C1
"In conclusion, it is true that young people will not have enough time to spend on the community service since people's energy are limited."	E_C1

"With great success for the city,goverment will surly spend money on some parts of traspotion."	E_I0
"From my point of view, government should spend money both on railways and roads."	S_T1
"In the past of few years, railways has become the most important devolping transportation in my country."	S_M1
"Many railways have been built."	B_S0
"As a point of view, railways has some advantages of  carrying faster, carrying more people, more cheaper and more lighter."	I_S0
"What's more, there is a word said' If a contry has the most railways, it will be a most devolping one in the world'."	I_S0

"A growing number of people believe that those who in the senior management positions should have higher reward."	S_T1

"On the one hand,not everyone can be a senior management."	I_S0
"If you have not enough efforts,you would not be a competent person."	I_S0

"In the same company, the salary for different level has different salary is easy to understand,  and it's what a company should have, because it can let the worker has a ambixious to work harder to get into the high level."	B_T1
"I agree with this topic, and I think it's a good thing."	E_T1

"AS the picture shows,there are 4 main modes of transport in the UK between 1974 and 2002 for goods transportation."	S_T1
"The most widly used transportation is road which was about 70 million tonnes in 1974 and grew up to 100 million tonnes in 2002."	B_S0
"And next one is the transportation of water,it transpot about 40 million tonnes per year between 1974 to 1978 and increased sharply between 1978 and 1982 to almost 60 million tonnes per year, and then slowly decreased until 1998, at last, in 2002 the transportation of water brought nearly 65 million tonnes goods."	I_S0
"The most stable mode of transport is rail , in 1974 it carried 40 million tonnes, and then decreased a little to1995 , and grew to 40 in 2002."	I_S0
"And the last one pipeline ,is also the least used one."	I_S0

"Different people has  thousands og ways to relax during the free time."	S_T1
"And students are more likely to go to a trip or do some part time job when they are graduate."	B_S0
"In my opinion,I think the advantages are more than disadvantages."	I_S0
"There are a number of benifits."	I_S0
"The first one is to travel or to work can help them to meet more different people that they ever know when they are in school."	I_S0
"For example,when they are doing some part time job,they need to communicate with different ages or charactristics people."	I_S0
"They should use suitable ways to satisied everyone,and also need more patient when the costomer was asking something."	I_S0
"Then,the young people can learn a lot of kuowledge during the trip."	I_S0
"For instance,talking to the native people,can easily understand more autochthonic culture and stories."	I_S0
"Those things can broaden their horizon and learn more useful skills."	I_S0
"In addition,students can become independent,that means they will do not rely on anyone."	I_S0
"Meanwhile when sometiomes they are in trouble,they will use their own mind to solve the problem rather than ask for others help."	I_S0
"On the other hand, some parents consider that travel is waste time,they prefer their child to go to the training course rather than hang out ."	I_S0
"Because they think study can help them know more knowledge,and after they enter the university they will quickly adapt  to the life of university."	I_S0
"Also nowadays,many students are more likely to stay at home and enjoy the computer games."	I_S0
"As far as I am concerned,travel and work are more suitable for persent students,because they are stay in school for a long time and protect by parents and teachers,some stundents even lose some life skills."	I_S0
"So they need some practices to help them in the future or to protect themselves."	I_S0
"All in all,the university contains people from different parts of nation,they should communicate with every students."	I_S0

"The writer and the professor have a debate on whether the humpback whales use stars to navigate."	B_I0
"The writer provides three pieces of evidence to prove it but the professor argues that none of those three evidences are very convincing."	E_I0
"Firstly, the writer points out that  humpback whales seem to be intelligent enough to use stars to navigate by."	S_M0
"Whales' brains have a high degree of complexity'a common determiner of intelligence."	B_S1
"But the professor thinks there doesn’t seem to be any real connection between intelligence and an animal's ability to use stars for navigation."	E_S1
"Secondly, the writer claims that  humpback whales migrate in straight lines."	S_M0
"However, the professor says that there may be a different explanation for the humpback whale’s ability to navigate in straight lines."	S_S2
"Third, the writer says that  humpback whales exhibit an unusual behavior: they are sometimes observed floating straight up for minutes at a time, their heads above the water as though they were looking upward."	S_M0
"In a contrast, the professor thinks spyhopping probably has nothing to do with looking at stars."	S_S2
 
"Nowadays, giving children money when they get in school is popular in parents,espeically the people who are very young."	S_T1
"In my opinion, that is not suitable for them to take too much money to school."	S_T0
"On the one hand, the parents don't how their children use these money excatly."	S_M1
"As a young school student, they are easily to influnenced by the wonderful world, so they can't contrl themselves as same as adults."	B_S0
"If parents give them too much money they may use to do the things such as buying computer games using and so on."	I_S0
"As a result, they may ignore their study and bocome a bad boy."	I_S0
"On the other hand, giving too much money is not a good way to their's development."	I_S0
"They may don't konw the hard to earn money because they think that parents wii give them moeny and they needn't to make living in themselves."	E_S0
"Some parents may argue that when their children meet some sudden things, the money can help them."	S_M1
"There is no doubt that people can't living without money."	B_S0
"But if the children study in school safety, how they will meet the moment to use the money?"	I_S0
"They wiil get the help from the teacher if they meet the difficulties trutly."	E_S0
"So the parents could only give them a little money in order to ensure they can buy snacks when they after school."	B_C0

"As for means of water, its godds remained almost unchanged between 1974 and 1978,1982 and 1994."	I_S0
"But it increases from 1978 to 1982."	I_S0
"Apart from these two means,the means of rail and pipeline seem to be less popular."	I_S0
"That is to say, the goods transported by rail fluctruated between 1974 and 2002 at a low level."	I_S0
"At the same time, the goods in means of pipeline increased softly from 1974 to 2002."	E_S0
 
"In my opinion, the idea that parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade is not good."	S_T0
"On the one hand, the purpose for children to study in school is to get new knowlege and improve himselves, not to get money."	S_T1
"When the child is young, he won't understand completely why he needs to go to school."	S_S0
"As a child, he may just want to play and have fun."	S_I0
"While study sometimes can be very boring."	B_S0
"In this case, he will think he must go to school because his parents will become angry if he don't."	I_S0
"And then, if at the moment you propose to offer money for high grade, he  will change his reason."	I_S0
"But later, the child will last studying for money for a long time until one day he finds the real meaning of study."	E_S0
"On the other hand, children should realize they study for themselves not for their parents."	S_M2
"When the child grows up, he will leave home and live by himself."	B_S0
"He will convert what he learned before to production to the socity and get the
 corresponding  pay, such as friends, respect, honor and money."	I_S0
"We can't live a life with our parents."	I_S0
"We need to take care of our parents when they old."	I_S0
"So children should know the person who benefits from his study is himself."	E_S0
"In a word, the behavior that"	S_S2
 
"Noadays, study have a lot of way, such as study with group and study alone."	S_I0
"many student like study alone, because they don't like communite with others, but some student like study with group because they can study more efficirnly and also can make some friends."	B_T1
"so  l agree students work  in group much more effectively than when they are work alone."	E_T1
"First,  for the project is always have a lot of problem, if one work alone they can not have way to solve the problem because no one can help her."	S_M2
"If who work with group it will be study more efficirnly, when some have a problem thy can help each other and also they can share the experienment."	B_S0
"For example,before l was very like training with alone, l think training alone can make great progress."	I_S0

"Controversially, there are increasing concerns about the topic that whether government should invest into public facilities instead of art."	S_T1
"It is widely thought that the government shoud fund into the construction of infrastructures to cater to the basic needs of citizens."	B_S0
"However, from my perspective, the government should give an emphasis on the artistc which is also an indispensable part of the society."	I_S0
"To be honest, the construction of infrastructures should be given the first priority by the government, playing a vital role in satifying the elementary requirements of life and ensuring the sustainable development of the society."	I_S0
"For instance, in China, a majority of people rely on the public transportation to work, such as bus, metro and ferry."	I_S0
"Moreover, the compulsory education is free of charge provided to the students, which not only eases the financial burdens of each family, but also guarantees the equal chances being educated."	I_S0
"However, that is not to say the spending on the aristic projects is useless."	I_S0
"To be specfic, the investment on the art contributes to the fulfillment of spiritual life, in pursit of the long-term social development."	I_S0
"In details, the government should subsidy artistic activities in the community, developing the sense of beauty and promoting the communication among the neighborhood."	I_S0
"Further, if the young generation have an easy access to art, they may develop an intellectual mind about beauty and love."	I_S0
"Moreover, the spending on artists is intensively demanded."	I_S0
"As there are an surging amount of traditions and cultural items disappearing nowadays, the subsidies on the protection of them are obviously significant."	I_S0
"Taking the Forbidden City as an example, the investment on the restoration of cultural relic can attract latest technology and human talents, accelerating the  recuing process of traditions and historic heritage."	I_S0
"Overall, though the most enssential task of government is to meet the basic living requirements, the art should be attached the equal importance to boost the mental life and protection of cultures."	I_S0
"It is the government that is responsible for the sensible allocation of social resources."	E_S0
 
"Rewarding school-age children with money is not a good decision."	B_T1
"so I don't think it is a good idea."	I_T1
"Using money to encourage children will let them develop bad values."	I_T1
"When you first reward them by using money,you may not think it is going to affect the kids."	I_T1
"But the first time a child receives money for this,they take it for granted."	E_T1
"They will think that if they do it right,they will be rewarded with award or even money."	B_S0
"Such values are very repugnant nowadays."	I_S0
"If I Have a child with such a valve,I will be upset and regret for my educating."	I_S0

"In this period,television was very common in every families."	S_T1
"In the past,television was rare and the choise on the TV channels was limited."	B_S0
"But now, there are more and more kinds of TV channels."	I_S0
"Many people think that's perfect, but others think it is bad to quality of TV programs."	I_S0
"In my opinion, having more TV channels is a good thing,it gives people many different choice."	I_S0
"Everyone has different interest,they can choose the favourate programs in many choices."	I_S0
"And people can watch many kinds of programs."	I_S0
"Maybe they can find a program that wonderful."	I_S0
"Such as cartoon,music programs,documentary or news."	I_S0
"Then, more TV channels make people have freedom to choose their programs."	I_S0
"Many people don't know what should they watch,so they can choose from more channels."	I_S0
"If there is only few programs in the television,I think more people will choose to play their cellphones or computers."	I_S0
"Those have more choices to people."	I_S0
"Instead,more programs make people find the best one."	I_S0
"In conclusion,more channels make people watch different kinds of programs and make people have more freedom to choose programs."	I_S0

"This graph is about the qualitities of goods transported in the UK between 1974 and 2002."	B_S0
"First，I would talk about the most highest quantities of goods transport in UK."	I_S0
"During 1974 to 2002,road is the highest one ."	I_S0
"Next, water transport and rail transport are in the middle."	I_S0
"For example ,use ship to transport is a very convenient option ,the drawback is that it takes too long."	I_S0
"Compared with the first three, there is much less pipeline transportation."	E_S0
 
"The chart is showing the percentage of England and Wales people who own a house or rent a house from 1918 to 2011."	S_T1
"From 1918 to 1961, there have significant gap between households owning and renting."	B_S0
"The percentage of the households who rented accommodation reach up to 75 percent."	I_S0
"But in the same year, the percentage of households in owend accommodation were just 21 or 22 percent."	I_S0
"So there is a really huge gap between these two group."	I_S0
"But as time goes on , the gap is becoming smaller and smaller."	I_S0
"The percentage of rented group still keep the high rate,  the owned group' percentage is rise up."	I_S0

"The popularity of music from all of the world become general show a increase trend, so how well does music combine the different individuals of ages and cultres become a hot topic."	I_I0
"For my pespective, I totally disagree this statement."	E_I0
"There are some reasons will explain my view."	S_T0
"On the one hand, it is undeniable that more and more music from other countries become popular, but these music has different type and different audiences, and these audiences are divided into different ages."	S_M1
"For example, a type of music called Jazz, there are more old and traditional people would like to listen it, and the west regions has more audiences than east regions, such as England and Germany, there are many people like Jazz, but in Indonesia, there are few people listen to jazz."	B_S1
"As a result, it is obvious that music is restricted by region."	E_S1
"On the other hand, although it is ture that music promotes the  communication of different age of individuals, but it is very limited, proof by facts, even so teenagers are more open to music from other cultures, they also have distinct style differences, like some people like popmusic, they may have little exposure to other kinds of music."	S_M1
"Music does not bring different people together, conversely, the music divide them into more parts than even before."	S_S2
"Overall, music has been accelerating with the development of science and technology, and brings many changes for all of the world."	B_C1
"Complax as the issue is, because music has limitations, and for my perspective, music could not become a good way of bringing people of different cultures and ages together."	E_C1
"Music brings benefits in other ways."	S_S2
 
"With the prevalence of internet,more and more people can choose work or study at home."	B_T1
"Personally,the benefits
outweigh the drawbacks."	E_T1
"It is argued that working or studying at home will have  negative effects on face-to-face communication skills,for the reason that people working or studying at home does not need to interact face to face, instead they communicate by internet."	S_M2
"However i think it is short-sighted."	B_S1
"Although communication through internet decrease the time of face-to-face communication of studying or working,we can complement the time by other activities,ranging from planting trees to football sports,which will also improve our face-to-face communication skill."	E_S1

"SOME PARENTS OFFER THEIR CHILDREN MONEY FOR EACH HIGH GRADE THEY GET IN SCHOOL, I THINK THIS IS A GOOD IDEA."	B_S0
"BECAUSE ALL THE PEOPLE HAVE TO WORK FOR SOMETHING, AND IF YOU JUST TELL YOUR CHILDREN THAT ALL THE SCHOOL WORK THEY DID ARE FOR THEIR FUTRUE, IT'S TOO FAR FOR THEM."	I_S0
"THEIR PARENTS NEED GIVE SOME REWARDS FOR THEIR WORK, THEN THEY CAN HAVE A PORPOSE."	I_S0
"FOR EXAMPLE, ALL THE ADULTS ARE WORKING FOR SOMETHING TOO, LIKE MONEY."	I_S0
"IF A COMPANY WANT TO RECRUIT THE EMPLOEE BUT WITHOUT GIVING THEM MONEY, I ASSUME NO ONE WOULD COME AND WORK FOR THAT COMPANY."	I_S0
"EVEN IF THERE HAS SOME PEOPLE CAME, THEY WOULD NOT WORK HARD FOR NOTHING."	I_S0
"IT'S SAME AS CHILDREN."	I_S0
"IF PARENTS SHOW THEIR REWARD, AND THEIR CHILDREN REALLY WANT IT, THEY WILL WORK HARD TO GET IT, BUT DO NOT GIVE THEM VERY HIGH STANDARD."	I_S0
"HERE IS A BAD EXAMPLE."	I_S0
"A CHILD GET F IN HISTORY EVERY SINGLE TIME, AND HIS/HER PARENTS SAID"IF YOU GET A  IN HISTORY, I WILL GIVE YOU FIVE DOLLARS" THEN THE CHILD WILL THINK HE/SHE CAN NEVER ACHIEVE IT, SO WHY SHOULD HE/SHE WASTE HIS/HER TIME ON THE BORING STUDY."	I_S0
"IF SOME ONE ASK YOU TO FLY, AND TELL YOU IF YOU CAN FLY WITHOUT ANY HELP, THEN YOU CAN GET A MILLION DOLLARS, WILL YOU TRY IT, OR TAKE IT AS A JOKE?"	I_S0
"SO THE CHILDREN NEED SOME REWARD FOR THEIR HARD WORK, AND A ACHIEVABLE LINE."	I_S0
"MY OPINION IS SOME PARENTS OFFER THEIR SCHOOL-AGE CHILDREN MONEY FOR EACH HIGH GRADE THEY GET IN SCHOOL IS A GOOD AND SMART IDEA, IT CAN MAKE STUDY ITSELF BE MORE FUN TO THEIR CHILDREN, IT CAN MAKE THE CHILDREN SHOW MORE INTERESTED IN STUDY, AND WORK HARDER IN THEIR WILL, THE PROCESS OF STUDY WILL CONTAIN LESS FORCE BY OTHERS, LIKE THEIR PARENTS."

"Firstly, they have so many subjects need to learn and they need study all days."	I_S0
"And secondly, the test more and more difficult, they need study more things after class."	I_S0
"They need spend their free time to study."	I_S0
"So they do not have enough time to be relaxed and even do not have time to sleep."	I_S0
"Lastly, their parents and teacher hope them to be best, they will give students too much stress on study."	I_S0
"It makes student do not like studying."	I_S0
"For this phenomenon, I have three suggest for students and their parents."	I_S0
"First, we can have the list to tell us what time we need to do things and we need to have the enough time to be relaxed."	I_S0
"In your time, you can do somthing you like."	I_S0
"It is helpful for your studying."	I_S0
"Second, we need to study efficiently."	I_S0
"It can make us have more time to do somthing we like."	I_S0
"We need know how to study."	I_S0
"Yet we spend so much time to study."	I_S0
"Last, parents need talk with their children about something funny or relaxing."	I_S0
"Do not give students too much stree."	I_S0
"When they live in home, they want some congratulations for they finish the their goal."	I_S0
"We can know that students have negative thoughts on studying because of many things like some stress  for social."	I_S0
"If we want students do not have negative thoughts, we need care about them more."	E_S0
 
"In light of the rapid development of the city,the pollution of the environment and the heavy traffic have been cared about more and more by the pubic,for which the country needs to develop its public transportation."	S_I0

"The appearance of the bike sharing scheme does bring convinience to Wuhan people'S life."	S_M1
"When the destination is not so far,it's easier to ride the shareing bike rather than take buses or subway or just walk on foot."	B_S0
"What's more,it's a good service for users to experience at a low prince."	I_S0
"People don't need to buy a blke by thenselves."	I_S0
"Riding for one time just costs about one yuan."	E_S0
"However, there are also many problems need to be solved now."	S_M1
"First,we can see that the firms of sharing bike like Mobike and ofo can't make profits now even three years after their establishment."	B_S0
"Depending on other firms to give money for their development is absolutely an undependable way,and if this industry can work conitnuous waits to be seen."	I_S0
"Second,the impolite behaviours are always seen when riading the sharing bike,such as breaking the bikes,using them as their own ones and change the 2D code to get money illegally."	I_S0
"Third,the government hasn't constructed enough riding and parkig places for bike,and because of the boom of the number of bikes,it's hard to control this just by several volunteers."	E_S0

"He told me making mistake was good and it was the symbol of progresee."	I_S0
"Undle my father's help."	I_S0
"I finally succeed in playing bicycle."	E_S0

"Through the bar chart below, we can know that the rate of female's solitude is slightly higher than that of male's, which is less than 5%."	S_I0
"In the age range of 16-49, the uniqueness rate of men is higher than that of women."	S_M1
"And with the growth of age, the difference between the two data is also growing."	B_S0
"Especially in the 35-49 age group, the rate of men living alone will be as high as 70%."	I_S0
"The increase in the number of men living alone has declined rapidly in the 50-65 age group."	I_S0
"In this period, the rate of male solitude is the same as that of female uniqueness, both of which are 50%."	I_S0
"After this age stage, we can find that the rate of female solitude has increased rapidly, reaching 70% by the age of 85."	I_S0
"In the big age span of 65-85 years old, the growth rate of female's solitude rate is much higher than that of male's solitude rate of 16-49 years old."	E_S0

"It is quite universally these days that some students have a break from studying after graduating from high school."	S_T1
"The trend is not restricted to students who travel, but is also envident among students who choose to work and become economically independent for a period of time."	B_S0
"The reasons for this trend may invovle the recognition that a young adult who passes directly from school to university is rather restricted in terms of general knowledge and experience of the world."	I_S0
"By contrast, those who have spent some time earning a living or travelling to other places, have a broader view of life and better personal resources to draw on."	I_S0
"They tend to be more independent, which is a very important factor in academic study and research, as well as giving them an advantage in terms of coping with the challenges of student life."	I_S0
"However, there are certainly dangers in taking time off at that important age."	I_S0
"Young adults may end up never returning to their studies or finding it difficult to readapt to an academic environment."	I_S0
"They may think that it is better to continue in a particular job, or to do something completely different from a university course."	I_S0
"But overall, I think this is less likely today, when academic qualifications are essential for getting a reasonable career."	I_S0
"My view is that young people should be encouraged to broaden their horizons."	I_S0
"That is the best way for them to get a clear perspective of what they are hoping to do with their lives and why."	I_S0
"Students with such a perspective are usually the most effective and motivated ones and taking a year off may be the way to gain this."	E_S0
 
"Shown in the diagram is the life cycle of the silworm and the stages in the production of silk cloth."	B_I0

"Firstly,an egg of silkworm will break after 10 days to becomes from a silkworm larva."	I_I0
"It rely on the mulberry leaf to live."	E_I0
"After 4 to 6 weeks,it will becomes from a silk thread and after 3 to 8 days,the cocoon will have been forming."	S_T1
"The production of silk cloth is about 5 processe."	S_M2
"Primarily,we need to select the cocoon,and then boil it in the boiling water."	B_S0
"On top of that,the cocoon will be unwinded from thread,an original one after unwind is approximately 300 to 900 meters."	I_S0
"Fourthly,twisting the thread,at the same time have a dye of it."	I_S0

"I only sit down and watch TV and play computer games all day long."	B_S0
"I don't think increasing the number of gyms will make much difference to me at all."	I_S0
"More gyms only can offer those already fond of exercises more choices."	I_S0
"Those who don't like exercises will still stay at home like me."	I_S0
"Like many people who love watching sports but never do sports and they would not pay attention to the sports events."	I_S0
"They will not be interested whatever you say to them anyway."	E_S0
"So we need other ways to improve public health."	S_M1
"Of course building more hospitals and train more doctors will help a lot."	B_S0
"But that is not the best way to improve public health at all, only to save those who have disease or other health problems."	I_S0
"In my view,most health problems are related to unhealthy eating habit and unbalanced diet."	I_S0
"So maybe the government should pay more attention to make more healthy food producing laws and control food producers to produce more healthy food for people to eat, such as restricting them to put in too much additive, salt, oil or other harmful ingredient in their processed foods."	I_S0
"Maybe this way can reduce the number of people who getting ill from eating processed food or other harmful foods."	E_S0

"In recent decades, most individuals pay increasing attention to relax."	S_I0
"Groups of people reckon that doing physical exercise is better to relax than watching a movie or reading a book."	B_T0
"However, personally speaking, i firmly believe that watching or reading is better to relax considering about several reasons."	E_T0
"For one thing, watching a movie or reading a book to relax is more convinient."	S_M0
"With the advent of modern society, more people face with stress in working, studying and life."	B_S0
"Therefore, people need to relax to sweeping out stress rapidly, which is easier and more convinient by watching a movie or reading a book."	I_S0
"Imaging that a person has quarral with his leader, then there's bad emotion inside him."	I_S0
"When he went back home by subway or bus, the person could watch a movie or reading a book in his telephone to forget this frustation rapidly."	I_S0
"However, if the person went to the gyms to doing some physical exersice for relaxing."	I_S0
"It's not easier to forget stress because there's a long time to his quarral."	I_S0
"Also, watching a movie or reading a book to relax could happen in break time."	I_S0
"In this case, it's timely to sovle the stress."	E_S0
"Another cardinal perspective is that watching a movie or reading a book is cheaper."	S_M0
"It's a common phenomenon that many people often go to theater or bookbar to relax which is cheaper for the majority of people."	B_S0
"Take an overview of Chinese situation in this case, there's more and more bookbars in big cities."	I_S0
"Because many people have various stress in their daily life, which need a place to solve leading to bookbars existing."	I_S0
"Furthuremore, in bookbars to read a book is cheaper and most people could accept the expense compared to expensive costs in gyms' physical exercise."	I_S0
"So for more people, it's better to relax by reading."	E_S0
"Admittedly, some people prefer to exercise in gyms to relax."	S_M0
"However, this is fewer compared to watching a movie or reading a book."	B_S1
"For instance, many gyms close because fewer people come to."	E_S1

"The reading passage talks about a device called turtle excluder device, also known as TED."	B_I0
"This device can install on the shrimp boat and help with sea turtle which is threatened by miscatching by the shrimper to excape."	E_I0
"The writers criticized that it is not a good idea to install the TED while the speaker reckons that TED is much a effective device to help with the sea turtle species in danger."	S_T1
"First, the author proposes that it is rare for sea turtle to be catched by shrimp boat."	S_M0
"However, the lecture pointed out that there are thousands of shrimp boat wandering on the sea, and if one boat will catch one sea turtle one month, thousands of sea turtle will die each year."	B_S1
"Plus, those sea turtles are species in danger, thousands of deaths of them could likely make the distinction of the species."	E_S1
"Second, the passage says shrimpers can shorten the time of neting in order to help sea turtle to escape from the net."	S_M0
"The speaker rebuts that this idea is just in theory."	B_S0
"Because there are thousands of shrimp boats driving on range area of sea."	I_S0
"It would be difficult for government to supervise all the shrimpers if they dispersedly located on the vast sea, thus the rule is harder to enforce to the shrimpers than the TED device."	E_S0
"Third, the author demonstrates that TED is too small for some sea turtles which can grow to a large size to escape."	S_M0
"The speaker retorts this notion and proposes that is is not a difficult thing to make the TED properr for the bigger sea turtle when it is needed in some specific area, Therefore, the writer's last word is also proved unconvincing."	S_S2
 
"The diagrams illustrate the cement-making process and the information about the concrete production."	S_I0
"At the beginning of cement production,there are two elements in the first step,they are the limestone and clay,they would be mixed and pushed into the crusher."	S_M1
"Then,they would be crushed to powder and sent into the mixer."	B_S0
"After that,the products would be sent into rotating heater through the pipeline and heated by fire from the heat."	I_S0
"Though heating,the products would be sent on the conveyor belt and ground by the grinder and become cement."	I_S0
"In the end,the cement would be packed into bags."	E_S0
"About the concrete production,there are four elements should be mixed and they should be distributed in different percentages."	S_M1
"They are cement,water,sand and gravel(small stones)."	B_S0
"In addition,the percentages of them are 15%,10%,25% and 50% respectively."	I_S0
"Besides,they would be mixed into a concrete mixer and then,by mixing evenly,concrete are formed."	E_S0
"Overall,cement production have about five processes and then concrete would be formed by mixing four elements in the concrete mixer."	S_C2

"Even though we do not know each other, we also like helping others who are in trouble."	B_T0
"My reasons are as follow."	E_T0
"The first point make is that we need more helps from other people in such a complex society."	S_M1
"With the development of transportation, there are more and more individual drivers."	B_S0
"It means more and more dangers for singel lady outdoors."	I_S0
"So they must be careful and always need help when they are in danger."	I_S0
"As a enthusiastic dweller, we should be willing to help them all the time."	I_S0
"Becouse we can not predict our condition."	I_S0
"And we don't know whenever we will meet danger."	E_S0
"In the second place, a larger number of people are in the same space at the same time."	S_M1

"More and more students are refusing to study and they are not interested in it."	S_T1
"People begin to be concern to this bad situation."	B_S0
"There are some reasons why they do this, and i have some advices for improving the problem."	I_S0
"To start with, in my opinion, the most important reason is they can not understand what is study."	I_S0
"They may do not know the significance of study,besides, they may do not good at study."	I_S0
"In this  situation, they will escape from studying more and more."	I_S0
"I have a middle school classmate who often leaved school at studying time."	I_S0
"One day i suggested he should go to school on time."	I_S0
"They told me that he can not understand the knowledges so he rather go out."	I_S0
"Secondly, as we all know, different people have different interests."	I_S0
"So, some children may really do not fit to study."	I_S0
"For example, Cristiano Ronaldo is a famous football player."	I_S0
"He had a poor grade in his middle school, but, he loved football very much."	I_S0
"Then, Ronaldo gave up study and began his football career."	I_S0
"Next, there are some advices for this students."	I_S0
"For the first kind of students, i believe that we should tell the benefit of studying to them, and tell them it will have many advantages for they future life."	I_S0
"On the other hand, we can encourage them to ask question to teachers."	I_S0
"We teach the way about studying, avoiding they lose interest again."	I_S0
"For the second kind of students we should tell them that they need to learn how to control their lifes."	I_S0
"If they have strong ambition, we should let they go."	I_S0
"From what has been discussed above, we may reach a conclude that we should have different ways for different, the most important is that we should make students know they can not too freedom."	E_S0
 
"Different types of progress are equally important"	S_S2
"Economic progress is a vital target for many governments,but there are still some people who think other types of progress are equally for a country."	B_T0
"I agree with the latter view."	E_T0
"On the one hand,economic development determines the status of  a country in the world."	S_M0
"So,governments are very concerned about it ."	B_S1
"And this will be beneficial to promote its economic growth within a short period."	E_S1
"On the other hand , a country also has other developments ,such as education,environment ,culture,technology and so on."	S_M0

"I think it's definitely not good to push all students do something whether the want or don't want to do, especially for students who are not interested in history class."	E_T0
"Taking history class is extremely boring for students who are not interested in history."	S_M0
"If you are someone really likes history stories, it's great."	B_S0
"But, for those who don't want to learn history or don't even care about history, if they still take their precious time learning something they don't like, that's a waste of time."	I_S0
"Universities are free places to enrich your life and knowledge, and it's also expensive."	I_S0
"It's smart for students choose what kind of courses they want to invest in."	E_S0
"While we talking about select courses, It's also not crucial for student in engineering department, for example, taking their time in some courses like history, to learn something they will never use when they start to work."	S_M0
"The main difference between universities and high schools is that universities separate students in major fields."	B_S0
"So students needs to learn courses more relevant to their professions, or just they likes."	I_S0
"It's not meaningful for students in different professions learn the same thing."	E_S0
"As statement claims that all university students should be involved in this approach."	S_M0
"It's everyone's freedom to choose which course to take, which examination to take and which professor they will meet."	B_S0
"A university should be an open ground for everybody to share what they want to learn and what they want to say."	I_S0

"The reason for why we should learn a foreign language has been widely disputed when we are mot content to only master our own mother tongue."	S_T1
"Someone  say,we learn foreign language just for travel or work and  I think this thinking is quite natural."	B_S0
"It is clear that if we hold lots of skills we can be more prominent in the crowd."	I_S0
"There are many company choose international operation,so the job seeker who can speak another language can be really important."	I_S0
"And also with the development of country we have much more opportunity to travel foreign countries."	I_S0
"If we can communicate with local people in their language,the travel will have more fun and more convenient."	I_S0
"On the other hands, learning a foreign language can bring out many others advantages."	I_S0
"Primaryly, learning a second language ismandatory in an academic syllabus which helps to undestand diverse cultural and traditional aspects ."	I_S0
"Moreover there are many students learning one or two language to improve improve their skills and expand their horizon."	I_S0
"Also know more different language gives people an advantages to read more books,because there are many meaningful books are not be translated,after reading them we can understand the lifestyle of different nationalities."	I_S0

"Now,people always live in a high-pressuered and fast-paced lifestyle."	S_T1
"So,it is undeniable that the fast food become very popular in urban area,which always make people suffering a lot of healthy diseases,such as obesity,heart diseases and a series of problems."	B_S0
"For the situation,some people think that governments can increase the tax revenue to limit this kind of food."	I_S0
"But Other one think that it is a ridiculous method."	I_S0
"I think that a higher tax is not a great way to solve the problem."	I_S0
"One possible reason to support my view is that fast food is indeed very convenient and save time."	I_S0
"Even if government obviously increase the tax revenue for fast food,people still choose this food."	I_S0
"Because of in the fast-paced lifestyle,thet do not have a lot of time to prepare with buying materials and cook."	I_S0
"Consequently,fast food has become the best choice."	I_S0
"So they will still afford the expensive price to purchase them and the policy can not make any influece for limiting fast food."	I_S0
"Other healthy food can not use this way to gain a important role again."	I_S0
"An alternative reason is that fast food play an important role in catering industry."	I_S0
"A lot of employee who worked for the fast food restuarant need to the job to earn a living."	I_S0
"If the government incearse tax revenue steeply,the sale of these restaurants will decilne obviously and a majority of employee from this restaurant will lose their job."	I_S0
"There is no doubt that it is very unpeaceful for these workers."	I_S0
"Despite the analysis above,some smooth higher tax revenue could help government to limit people choosing fast food."	I_S0
"Low price is the important reason why the people choose the kind of food."	I_S0
"When the price steeply climb,maybe some people will tend to choose the higher quality and healthier food in the same price."	I_S0
"To sum up,I think that we should choose more correct ways to solve the problem rather than easily to increase their prices."	I_S0
"It is suppested that government should pay more attention to how to improve nutrition and change the people's diet,And for person,people should consciously choose the healthy food to replace the junk food and care about the healthy diet."	E_S0
 
"In the past 30 years, due to the rapid growth of the number of cars, there are many problems of traffic congestion now, and the problem of traffic congestion has become more and more serious."	S_I0
"I think this is partly true."	S_M0
"First of all, with the development of social economy, more and more people have the economic strength to buy private cars."	B_S0
"And with the development of science and technology, the number of automobile production is increasing."	I_S0
"As a result, there are more and more traffic jams."	I_S0
"Secondly, the causes of traffic congestion are as follows: with the increase in the number of cars, the roads are not expanded to a certain extent, and some people do not follow the traffic rules, which will also lead to traffic accidents and traffic congestion."	E_S0
"For example, some roads only allow three cars to drive at the same time, but this road is the only way for some people to go to work and school."	S_M0
"So this will cause too many vehicles, and the road is relatively narrow and the formation of traffic congestion."	S_S2
"I think the government can take some measures to solve the problem of traffic jam."	S_M0
"First of all, the government can take economic measures to expand the road area of some congested sections, so as to alleviate the problem of traffic congestion."	B_S0
"The relatively congested section can be changed from three cars driving at the same time to four or five cars driving at the same time."	I_S0
"Secondly, the government should strengthen the management and strictly punish those who violate the traffic rules."	I_S0
"In this way, traffic accidents on the road can be reduced and traffic congestion can be alleviated."	E_S0
"To sum up, I think that through these methods, the government can alleviate certain traffic congestion problems."	S_C2
 
"Nowadays many people have the habit of throw away things used in a short time around the world and this phenomenon bring some problems."	S_I0
"From my perspective, there are two factors which result in the case."	S_T0
"To begin with, the powerful manufacture using assembly line have the ability to provide people with countless goods in high quality, which create the precondition for people to throw away stuffs without hesitate."	S_M1
"One good example is the overuse of the napkin."	B_S0
"Whenever one person step into a restaurant,  the waiter would serve the one sufficient napkin."	I_S0
"Someone may use 7 pieces and someone may use more at their mealtime, and the point is that few people would take the full use of each napkin."	I_S0
"Because everyone knows that everyday a large amount of napkin are produced and no one would think that a piece of napkin is precious."	E_S0
"The second factor is the lack of the environmental education."	S_M1
"What I mean is that the one live in a 'throw-away' style"	O
"is probably also the one lack of the education of t"	O
 
"The amount and quality of TV channels have been heatedly discussed nowadays."	S_T1
"Concerning this issue, people have different standpoint:while some maintain that the more channels TV has,the more joy it will bring,others hold the opposite viewpoint."	B_S0
"However, as for me this is a comparatively complicated issue, since both advantages and disadvantages both exist and the TV stations should  balance the two."	I_S0
"With the development of leisure industry,much more kinds of TV programs have gotten into peoples horizon."	I_S0
"More TV channals mean that in the same time ,there are more choices for audiences."	I_S0
"For example, in 19670s ,most TV channals are about news and policy."	I_S0
"Especially in China,there was only CCTV could be watched by Chinese people."	I_S0
"These days , a report from National Radio and Television Administration illustrates that in the past 30 years ,the number of TV audiences has surged by 425% all around the world while the number of channels has ascended by 367%."	I_S0
"What we can see from these data is that the more channels there are ,the more choices and audiences there wiil be."	I_S0
"But on the other hand ,many more shoddy channals also appeared."	I_S0
"In fact ,to fight other companies, some TV channels would like to copy creative  ideas or even use the same name."	I_S0
"In this case,people may find that although there are hundreds of channals, they cant find what they want."	I_S0
"What annoys me most is that I can see four or five channels inviting singers choosing students in the same time."	I_S0
"The quality of progamme is one worse than others."	I_S0
"As far as i am concerned, the variaty of TV channels can effectively attract audiences, but the quality and the feeling of freshness are fundamental."	I_S0
"All in all, what people want to get from TV programmes is relax,so there can be less chann"	E_S0
 
"Fast food provides people a convenient approach to satisfy their stomach in such a high pace society."	B_I0
"A higher tax is asked by some people to be imposed on fast food for the health problems it brings."	E_I0
"Although a high tax can bring a decline to the fast food industry, I don't think a too higher tax is an efficient method to solve the health problems it brings."	S_T1
"A higher tax imposed on fast food will do harm to consumers."	S_M0
"The fast food restaurants will have to increase the price in order to compensate the loss brought by a higher tax."	B_S0
"The consumers who rely on fast food, especially the office works in big cities, will have to pay a higher prize, forcing them to decrease daily intake or turn to some cheaper food low in quality."	I_S0
"They might spent less money or pay less attention on taking care of their health, sacrificing their health to keep their daily work running."	E_S0
"The industry of food will also suffer from a high tax."	S_M0
"In order to avoid the financial dilemma caused by the tax, the restaurants might turn to the material of lower quality so they can limit their cost."	B_S1
"As a result, the quality of fast food will decrease and lead to another crisis for people health."	E_S1
"A reasonable fast food tax policy can help in people's health in some other ways."	S_M0
"The government can use the tax from the fast food industry to encourage the health food industry."	B_S0
"Restaurants can receive subsidies and other supports from the government if they focus on health food and reduce production of unhealthy fast food."	I_S0
"Also, methods for healthy lives, like gyms and apps with courses for healthy diet and exercise, should be encouraged."	I_S0
"As soon as these industry thrive, they can bring benefit to people's health."	E_S0
"Fast food will certainly bring health problems, but in order to solve these problems, we should try to improve people's food quality and encourage them to lead a healthy life, instead of simply imposing a high tax on fast food."	S_C2
 
"The passage claims that the salvage logging is beneficial for recovering from forest fires or storms."	B_I0
"However, the professor in the lecture casts some doubts on that with three points."	E_I0
"First of all, the author claims that salvage logging could make lots of spaces for other plants to grow."	S_M0
"However, the lecture points out that cleaning up is not necessary."	B_S0
"The decomposition of dead trees can make soil more suitable for plants' growth."	I_S0
"The salvage logging can result in soil be less nutrient."	E_S0
"Secondly, the writer asserts that insect will damage live, healthy speruce trees, whereas the professor points out that it's true but not bad."	S_M0
"The dead trees are also used by birds and other insects."	B_S1
"Removing rotting wood will be more harmful to the forests."	E_S1

educational institution."	B_I0
"The kids just quit studing with the thought of  finding no prospect in their school."	I_I0
"Generally speaking,this kind of phenomenon can be caused by 3 reasons."	I_I0
"First,most of the students show little interest in what they learn in the textbook."	I_I0
"Sometimes they enjoy watching movies or drawing,but all they can do during the school studing time is to do some mathmatical exercises."	I_I0
"Meanwhile,they find that there is no connections between studing math,physics or any other courses and  their daily life."	I_I0

E_I0
"In addition, the school can set more interesting courses ang make an innovation in thier teachong ways."	S_S1

"Training themselves from working to help them to slove the problems alone, also can help them to communicate with other people as well as build the group and cooperation conception of their mind."	I_S0
"Wheras, this is not a way suits all the students, if a man has konwn what he want to do, it is better to start the study in university as soon as possible."	I_S0
"In addition, the students who do not have any goal and ideas of their future, maybe continue the study is a better way for them to grow up and build their thoughts and values, then, they can gap a year before the post-graduated studies maybe."	I_S0

"We can build the permanent station above the sky like balloons."	E_I0

"If the erderly people know more about the new world, the new technology, they can find numerous interesting things thus they can live a more happy life."	B_S0
"Reverly, most of our seniors are conventional and would not like to accept new thing."	I_S0
"Therefore they just sigh for the rapid changes rather than adpot those changes and become unhappy in the rest of their life."	I_S0
"I remember I have an uncle who do not like to accept new things recall its expericence all day around."	I_S0

"He know less about the world, like he do not how to use smart phone, do not understand the TV show and regard all this new things as boring things."	I_S0
"He just stay at his home and smokes all day around."	E_S0
"Second, it is beneficial for the elderly to learn new things because they can be more kind and friendly to us."	S_M1
"If a old person learn a lot of things about our young people, he or she may become popular among young people and be regard as a very kind and friendly person."	B_S0
"Reverly, We know that a lot of old people seem to reject to understand what the young man do."	I_S0
"And they are considered to be sophicaited and no one like them."	I_S0
"For example, I remeber a old teacher who love to learn new things about young man and he is so popular among students and students all think he is a good and kind teacher."	E_S0

"Nowadays a great amount students tend to take a year off before they go to the university."	S_T1
"some people believe the benefit it brings to them overtakes the drawbacks,which I really agree."	B_S0
"There are some reasons why it is more beneficial for students to do this."	I_S0
"Firstly,It is a percious chance to relax themselves."	I_S0
"The high school offers students an exam-orientation education so there are endless exams and courses for high school students,after they graduate from high school,no doubt that they need some leisure time to relax and do nothing."	I_S0
"Under this circumstance they can embrace their unversity life full of energy."	I_S0
"Secondly,gap year is also helpful for them to choose what they will major."	I_S0
"Students are more likely to be confused by a wide range of course and majors in university so it is easy for them to choose the wrong path."	I_S0
"So they can make full use of their gap year."	I_S0
"In that year,they can find a part time job or spend time with people from all works of life,so they can make it clear that what they will major in."	I_S0
"Thirdly,They can also gain a fresh experience of life,which can be an unforgettable momory in thier life."	I_S0
"For in that year,they don't need worry about how to earn a living as well as pressure from their academy."	I_S0
"Therefore they can do what they are willing to do."	I_S0
"What I also want to mention is that gap year can help them get the hang of some skills which can not be taught in school like the social skill and living skill."	I_S0
"Some disadvantage brought by gap year also can not be igored,like it will be hard for students to adapt to their campus life after they come back to university."	I_S0
"But it can be effectively solved in some simple ways."	I_S0
"So even if every coin has two sides,but it comes as no surprise that advantage gap year brings totally overweighs the disadvantage."	I_S0
"That is way more students are likely to do this when they finish their high school"	E_S0

"With the development of economy, parks with kinds of sports equipment can be seen anywhere in some cities, which supply a  good chance for citizens to do some exercise and relive stress, thus strengthening their bodies as a result."	B_S1
"So if we are access to more sports facilities, the public health will be better, but it is not the all to solve the problem."	E_S1
"The best way to improve public health is a complex question, which may need to combine the sports facilities and raise people's awareness of how to get a good health."	S_M1
"In some cases, there are enough place and tools for people to do exercise, but lacking of desire to do prevents them from keeping a healthy body."	B_S0
"So, society should also emphasize the importance of public health and we can hire some professional coaches to guide and remind people to exercise."	I_S0

"Although the city encourages people by providing bins, it is surprising that the number of garbage collected by residents has not increased."	E_S0
"On the other hand, I think in order to solve this problem, it may be necessary to regulate the recycling law."	S_M1
"It is forbidden to impose high fines on citizens who refuse to recycle, and check whether garbage disposal is implemented door by door."	B_S1
"Ultimately, the policy achieves this goal because no waste is sent to landfills and waste is either recovered or disposed of."	E_S1
"To sum up, although cities help recycling methods to be more collective, individuals still neglect to collect recyclable waste."	B_C1
"Therefore, in this case, laws must be made in order to effectively solve the waste problem, otherwise recycling will still not succeed."	E_C1
 
"The development of children depends on many factors,including parents,school education,peers and so on,personally, i agree that the influence of the family is not as good as other parties working together."	S_T0
"my reasons will be discussed blew."	S_T1
"it is true that the family has a profound influence on children,because parents and elementary school teachers in children lives set an example for them to learn and imitate, and are remembered in their childhood thinking,and determine the basic behavior and thinking about them."	S_M1
"For example,by observing and learning the daily activities of parents ,such as talking,cooking and cleaning the house ,washing hands before eating,children can master language,self care ability and hygiene habits,in addition,parents also play a key role in developong children's intelligence,for example,through daily teaching,communication,and thinking and judgment."	S_S2
"However,ifirmly believe that outdooor activities have made a greater contribution to the overall growth of children."	S_M1
"First of all,in terms of academic education,teachers at school have piority,over their parents,for example,compared with some parents whose education level is low or even uneducated,teachers have receiver professional education and training in formal universities and are experienced in teachers have move advantages and influence in comprehensively and accurately guiding ,explaining and dispalying the theories and formulas related to the lwas of nature and the universe,math and physics and human common sense, communicate,entertain and argue with other peers,this powerful can make children proficient in social activites in the real world."	S_S2
 
"From my point of view,the answer is absolutely "yes",my reasons are presented as belows:"	S_S2
"With the development of the society,we are now so closely connected,which indicates that to help struggling strangers is to help ourselves at some time."	B_I0
"For instance,when you come across someone who is screaming in water and is drowning,he is likely to be somebody around you,like your relative or your college."	E_I0
"Obviously is that it don't take you much effort to give him a hand,but it really helps a lot,especially he may be your fellow."	S_S2
"Also,the society we are in now is the best throughout the whole history."	S_M1
"People are better educated ,thus having better personality than ever."	B_S0
"It is not far to seek that the society requires people to lend a hand to a struggling stranger as much as he can."	I_S0
"Normal people,especially the young,are as responsible as the great ones."	I_S0
"When an accident happens and the driver along with the passengers calls for help,the witnesses are certainly willing to call the ambulance and the police to make an effort to help them."	I_S0
"Rarely will people just walk away,which is considered ugly."	E_S0
"Last but not least,people today are more capable to help those in need,which meas usually what the struggling strangers need is just something you don't have to put into so much effort."	S_M1
"Contrary to popular belief,all he needs may be just a warm hug."	B_S1
"It is the thought to help that really counts."	E_S1
"As has been remarked above,it is clear to see that people today are actually more willing to help the struggling strangers."	S_S2
 
"The chart shows the information about post-school qualifications in terms of the different levels of further education reached by men and women in Australia in 1999."	S_I0
"There were difference in the proportion of men and women nearly at all kinds of levels."	S_M0
"The biggest gender difference is at the lowest post-school level, where 90% of those who held a skilled vocational diploma were men, compared with only 10% of women."	B_S1
"By contrast, more women held undergraduate diplomas(70%) and reached Bachelor's degree level(55%)."	E_S1
"In terms of the higher levels of education, men with postgraduate diplomas are nearly 70% and clearly more than the female counterpart."	S_M0
"Similarly, men also constituted 60% of Master's graduates."	S_S2
"Thus we can see that more men than women hold qualifications at the lower and higher levels of education, while more women reach undergraduate diploma level than men."	S_M0
"The gender gap is smallest at the level 
 of Bachelor's degree, however."	S_S2
 
"The first point made in the lecture is doubt on the idea the use of ethanol fuel would not help to solve environmental problems caused by gasoline use: global warming."	B_I0
"the lecture state that every plants will have carbon dioxide, so, whatever use eyhanol fuel to gasoline or not, the carbon dioxide was still have."	E_I0
"The second point made in the lecture is doubt on use ethanol fuel will dramatically reduce the amount of plants available for food to animals."	S_M1
"The lecture state that have another plant is easily to plant and better than ethanol fuel to be food for animal."	B_S1
"People can increase plant the other plant food for animal, so reduce the ethanol fuel to be food for animal is accpetable."	E_S1
"The third point made in the lecture is doubt on ethanol fuel will never be able to compete with gasoline on price."	S_M1
"although today the United States government cost a lot of tax subsidies to reduce the price of ethanol fuel, but when ethanol fuel can ba an alternative to gasoline, the buy of ethanol fuel will be increase directily."	B_S0
"so people will grow more ethanol fuel, when the ethanol fuel is enough, the price will decrease."	I_S0
"Finally, the prices of ethanol and gasoline are to be same."	E_S0
 
"The two maps give information about how the island has changed before the construction facilities for tourist and after."	B_T1
"To begin with the first map, it shows an island whit some trees scattering throughout the island and a beach located in west of island."	I_T1
"The size of the island from west to east is about 200m."	I_T1
"Then move on to the second map, it has many changed changes after construction for tourists."	I_T1
"Firstly, we can see a reception in the middle of the island, and some accommodations located in west and east of the reception."	E_T1
"Restaurant is to the north of island; Then there is a pier lie the south central of island where many boats are available for marine activities."	B_S1
"Vehicle track runs from restaurant and reception and pier, footpath connects the east and west dorms severally and the western part links also the beach."	E_S1
"Overall, the two maps show that after the construction, the most change is that general facilities had become available and make the island become a tourist attraction."	S_C2
 
"The two charts show the energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of various appliances in Australian households."	S_I0
"In the first chart, we can see that the energy consumption of household heating accounts for the largest proportion, reaching 42% of the total energy consumption."	B_T1
"The second is the water heatin, which consumes 30% of the energy."	I_T1
"However, the energy use of other appliances, refrigerators, lighting and refrigeration declined sharply, accounting for only 28% of the total."	E_T1
"In the second chart, we find that although heating consumes the most energy, it actually emit relatively less greenhouse gases, only 15% of the emissions."	S_M2
"The largest source of emissions is water heating, accounting for 32%, while the smallest is refrigeration, accounting for only 3%."	B_S1
"The biggest contrast comes from refrigerators and lighting, both of which emit twice the amount of greenhouse gases (7% of the energy consumption of refrigerators is 14%, 4% of the energy consumption of lighting is 8%)."	E_S1
 
"The charts compare the annual school spending by a UK school in 1981,1991 and 2001."	B_I0
"Among these years there are invatiably composed of five kinds of costs and the teachers' salaries are always the largest part of school spending, with about 50%."	E_I0
"From1981 to 1991, the insurance, other workers' salaries and  resources all increased a little within 10 percent while furniture equipment droped down from 15% to 5%."	S_M1
"And the other workers' salaries were always the second largest part."	S_S2
"When moved to 2001, furniture and equipment overtook the other workers' salaries became the second largest part with 23%."	S_M1
"And other workers' salaries and resources both decreased for about 6% in the meanwhile the insurance and furniture and equipment showed a upward trend and the insurance stayed a steady increase."	B_S2
"Overall, it is clear in these charts that by 2001 the specific school spending mainly consists of five types of consumptions and how they differnently changed in the three years."	E_S2
 
"The table gives the numbers of visitors to Ashdown Museum and the charts show the result of serveys asking  visitors how satisfiedwith their visit,during the year before and the year and the year after it was refurbished."	S_I0
"The  number of  vistors to  Ashdown Museum  during  the  year before refurbishment,with 74000,is lower than the number  of  vistors to  Ashdown Museum during the year after refurbishment,with 92000."	S_M2
"During  the  year before refurbishment,vistors were
dissatisfied with their visit,which accounted for a large proportion."	B_S1
"On the contray,During  the  year after refurbishment,vistors were satisfied with their visit,which accounted for a large proportion."	E_S1
"In conclusion,after refurbished,Ashdown  Museum becomes  better and  is  able  to  attract more  vistors."	S_C2
"In  addition,Visitor's degree of satisfaction has also risen,."	S_S2
 
"As the population become considerable, competition between humans become more cruel."	S_T0
"Some think such competition that workers in the high positions have higher salaries is too cruel to facilitate people in the lower class, but I belive only if the competition exsit, people can pregress."	B_S0
"Primarily, people who pay different efforts should not receive the equal return."	I_S0
"As we know, those who have the senior management positions must make contributions for their company and organisation."	I_S0
"Some of them are unable to sleep in order to finish the work perfectly, and higher salaries may be the power for them to do such things."	I_S0
"However, if everyone in the same company has the same salaries, no one will use up their energy and mind to sacrifice for their company."	I_S0
"Since no matter how much work they have done, they will receive the same rewards as people who do nothing or little thing."	I_S0
"It is unfair for those who work hard."	I_S0
"Furthermore, pressure is the most effective impetus for today's people."	I_S0
"Nowadays, many people are unaware of the crisis of increasing poplution, they will face a problem that more people means more gifted individuals."	I_S0
"If they do not have enough impetus to push them progress, they will be left behind others."	I_S0
"People who have higher salaries in the higher management positions in the same company is a appropriate kind of pressure."	I_S0
"Such pressure is not too stressful to give up and not too relaxing to degrade."	I_S0
"All the workers will have a goal to persuade high salaries and establish a improving company."	I_S0
"Overall, life is like the boat in the flowing water, if we do not go forward, we will be washed away and fall off the cliff."	I_S0
"Thus, it is truely a good thing for company to enable the salaries higher for people who are in the senior management positions than other workers."	E_S0
 
"I think it is not a good idea,it is too early for them to have such a number of money."	B_T0
"This would lead to the wasty in the future."	E_T0
"School-age children do not have the abiliity to get good use of their own money."	S_M0
"They may use them for criming and they just do not know."	B_S0
"I think unless they know the true use of money,parents do not need to give them the money out of their need."	I_S0
"Doing such behavior,children will not understand the difficulty of earing money,and they will not take good use of them."	I_S0
"They are just too young."	E_S0
"And they will not understand that do not show your money to others."	S_M0
"They may just put it in hands."	B_S0
"And every passer-by could see it."	I_S0
"In the addition,some crimer may want to hurt your child for their money,and they just give the criminal the money and still cannot feel there is something wrong."	I_S0
"They are easy-cheated,so maybe they have a high number of money but still do not know how to use them."	I_S0
"You give he these money,for hoping he could live better,but he may use the money on others."	E_S0
"Besides,they do not know each prices of each thing,they may buy a 100dollar apple and still feel happy,they may buy a 100dollar bread and feel exciting."	S_M0
"They may be cheated but they do not know."	B_S0
"But can you punish them?"	I_S0
"No,this is your fault."	I_S0
"You just give them the money,but you do not teach them how to use."	I_S0
"This is a big fault on your home-education."	I_S0
"You should not give them the money."	I_S0
"You should take them to use it."	I_S0
"In this way,You can improve the love between you and your child,but also can teach them by yourself."	E_S0
"It is not a good idea to offer your school-age child for each high grade."	S_C2
 
"Buildings are the most significant component in current society, and it can be divided into two main parts--new modern buildings and old historic buildings."	B_I0
"Old and historic buildings usually have gorgeous and amazing landscapes, and they will also attract more travellers to come to visit."	I_I0
"This will partly promote city tourism’s development, enhance city’s publicity thus to improve city economy and people’s living conditions."	E_I0
"However, I agree that it is more important for the government to build new housing mainly for two reasons: they can save public space and facilitate the city economy."	S_T0
"First of all, constructing new and modern buildings will save public space effectively for more people to live in."	S_M1
"Modern buildings are usually extremely high so that they contain enough people on each floor."	B_S0
"They will also give people as many work opportunities as possible."	I_S0
"Works such as electrician,planners, engineer and architects are in great demand while building these housings."	I_S0
"Works that after constructing buildings are also suitable for most people to choose."	I_S0
"Teachers, interns and white collar can all work in the new modern buildings."	I_S0
"Thus, this can help most people to find a job or get multiple work choices."	E_S0
"In addition, the economy will be facilitated if the government builds more new housing."	S_M1
"Since most people get a job, no one needs to worry about their daily life and living conditions."	B_S1
"Thus, they will spend much more time and money to consume products in order to facilitate the city economy."	E_S1
"Compared with new modern buildings, old and historic buildings take up more space and public resources because most historic buildings will use special materials to build and decorate only for people visiting."	B_C0
"That is a way of wasting resources."	I_C0
"To summarize, the government should pay more attention on constructing practical new buildings instead of only ornamental and wasteful historic buildings."	E_C0
 
"Some people claim that not enough of the waste from homes is recycled."	B_I0
"They want to make new laws to improve the situation."	E_I0
"But I don't think that the goverment needed to make it a legal requirement."	S_T0
"Firstly,I think we can use the system of the reward and punishment to require people  to follow this rule."	S_M1
"Those who fail to comply with this rule to be punish ,such as go to the prison or pay a fine."	B_S0
"This is a good way to prevent this peoblem from appearing."	I_S0
"So this can make people comply with the rule."	I_S0
"Also can let household garbage get enough recycled."	E_S0
"Secondly,we can get whole city talking about the benefits of recycling."	S_M1
"Whether in school or in the office,I think we can invite professionals to talk about the advantages of recycling."	B_S0
"Because it is impossible for everyone to know ,so this can let them know the impotance of this."	I_S0
"And we can make some brochures and hand them out to the citizens,so we can learn more about recycling."	I_S0
"In schools teachers can impact more knowledge in this field,also can do some small questionnatres about garbage colletion."	I_S0
"So we can let everybody know the impact of not recycling properly in our lives."	E_S0
"All in all,I think is the best method for us to use in our daily lives."	B_C0
"So I don not think it is in the law."	I_C0
"Those are my thoughts on the subject."	I_C0
"Maybe  many think there are many benefits to having it in the law,but it is not the only waY."	I_C0
"That is all I want to say it."	E_C0
 
"Nowadays, many competences are regarded as indispensable abilities for those successful people."	B_I0
"Without doubt, leadership is one of these capacities and it plays an essential role."	E_I0
"And there is an argument."	B_T0
"Some people indicates that leadership comes naturally."	I_T0
"However, from my perspective, one can learn to be a leader."	E_T0
"I mean, the leadership can be learnt by promoting leading skills and personalities."	S_T1
"First of all, encouraging people to learn leading skills is a gateway to expand their outlook and elevate them leading awareness."	S_M2
"As we all known, leading skills refer to certain methods which could be acquired by studying and training."	B_S0
"For example, creating an ambitious goal, balancing the relationship among the workers, the proper distribution of assignment."	I_S0
"When one dedicate much time and energy to it, people will fulfill themselves success."	I_S0
"Take my own experience for example."	I_S0
"When I was a freshman of college, I was supposed to lead our classmates to attend a volunteer activity but I didn't know how to allocate different person in charge different groups."	I_S0
"From that case, it illustrates that learning some skills will promote one's leadership."	E_S0
"In addition, leadership could be learnt by enhancing personal charisma."	S_C2
"That is to say that the passion and attraction which team members dedicate to the mission can be reinforced by personalities."	B_S0
"For example, if one is modest about his or her achievement rather than showing off it, others will perfer to trust the person and support one's proposal."	I_S0
"If one is confident of the fulfillment of task, friends are more likely to follow him or her because of the positive influence the person bring them."	E_S0
"From these case, we can conclude the more positive charisma people have, the more"	O
 
"Some people said that car ownship increased rapidly over the past thirty years and this phenomenon have generated 'one big traffic jam'."	S_I0
"For this statement,i think it is ture."	S_T0
"Without doubt,cars are vital for most of people because the convenience of personal cars is irreplaceable."	S_M2
"When people has to resolve some urgent events,they cannot wait for a taxi or subway,because they are unpredictable,which will delay their movement."	B_S0
"Especailly for going to a doctor,time is the most valuable thing for every patients,they may die even their cure is delayed one minute."	I_S0
"Thus,the massive demands of car is real and it is beyond our imagination."	I_S0
"And cars is more cheaper than an apartment,so most of people will buy a car firstly and even some rich people are likely to collect car as a collection."	I_S0
"Accordingly,car as convenient vehicle and are affordable for most of people,the 'big  traffic jam'is possible for some developed countries such as China,America and British and so on."	E_S0
"When face to a 'big traffic jam',how to deal with it is big problem and government always find some way to solve this problem."	B_C0
"First of all,enact relative laws,such as China."	I_C0
"In China,the buying of personal cars is limited,when people want to buy a car they should be selected by government in a system then they will have qualification to buy a car and the movement of car in China also controled by government,because government stipulate that the certain number of car could move out in certain days,which will help traffic police manage car easily."	E_C0
"Moreover,government could courage people from using bike or public transpotation by reduceing the relative tax or fee."	S_S2
 
"The following line chart provides the information about the average quantities about carbon dioxide that each person producted in four countries（the United Kingdom, Sweden, Italy, Portugal）in 40-year period of time from 1967 to 2007."	B_I0
"As we can see from the line graph, the amount of average carbon dioxide emissions have a great change in these four countries during past 40 years."	E_I0
"There is a steady decrease in the United Kingdom between 1967 and 2007(about 11 tonnes to 9 tonnes), but it still occupied the largest carbon dioxide producted country."	B_T1
"Then when it comes to Portugal, we can easily find that its average carbon dioxide emissions quantities always stands last."	E_T1
"Although there is an stable up trend in the past 40 years, it only arrived at around 5.5 tonnes as Sweden in 2007."	B_S0
"The according to the line graph, in Sweden, although the amount of carbon dioxide emissions was 8.8 tonnes in 1967, the following 10 years saw a sharply increase, arriving at about 10.5 tonnes in 1977."	I_S0
"After that, there was a down trend  in next 30 years."	I_S0
"As for Italy, there was an increase which arrived at 7 tonnes in 1990, then it exceeded Sweden, reaching the maximum point in 2007."	I_S0
"(about 7.8 tonnes)"	E_S0
"To sum up, it can be seen clearly that the quantities of carbon dioxide emissions had  great changes these years."	S_M2
"The United Kingdom still in the firs"	O
 
"The line gragh compares six kinds of cnsumption of energies in the USA between 1980 to 2030."	S_I0
"It is clear that most of the energy consumption show an upward trend between 1980 and 2030, and the most dramatic increase was seen in the petrol and oil and coal."	B_M0
"Looking more closely at the line gragh, we can see the gap between coal and natural gass is be widden throgh the period of 1980 to 2030."	E_M0
"What's more, the figure of natural gas and nuclear both remain stable from 2013 to 2030 with 23 quadrillion units and 2005 to 2025 with 7 units  respectively."	B_S1
"The number of petrol and oil fluctuates between 1980 an 1995, and then it has significant grow in the next year."	E_S1
"In the 1998, the energy of wind overtook the hydropower, at approxiametly 3 units."	S_M0
"Besides, the figure of nuclear, wind and hydropower is similar in 1980, at zbout 4 units, and then the gap between them become wide in following 5 decades."	S_S2
 
"It has to be said that the recycling of waste from home cannot be achieved without the contribution of everyone."	S_T1
"Firstly, it is no denied that the cultivation of cycling sense is so important for nowdays life."	S_M0
"There are so many place can producing garbage  by us nowdays, shopping on supermakert."	B_S0
"Particularly, with the development of online, the package is the main choice, most of it made from plastic."	I_S0
"On the online store, the mountains of packages come from different people."	I_S0
"All of these are connected with everyone."	I_S0
"It is the main source of waste."	E_S0
"Secondly, The governmant is a vital part participting in people daily life."	S_M0
"It can facilitate and cultivate the awareness of cycling."	B_S0
"Such as if there is laws produced, the people will certainly respond in a timely manner."	I_S0
"For instance, there is a policy in some cities of China with garbage sorting."	I_S0
"With the call on the government, every community pick up measures in time."	I_S0
"The differet cants are set in fixed place."	I_S0
"Every people learn the sorting knowledge and do as the order."	I_S0
"This greatly helps to establish good habits and promotes waste recycling simultaneously."	E_S0
"Thirdly, there are some many ways to achieve the recycle from home."	S_M0
"But thousands of ways cannot do without the participation of every household."	B_S0
"So the pivot of recyling is the people, and the government can act as a catalyst."	I_S0
"Both of them cannot be separated"	E_S0
"Lastly, with the combine of each other, the cycling from home can up to another level."	B_C1
"Hopefully, the sustainable andenvironmental area will come in the near future."	E_C1
 
"In the daily life, many parents may roar to their children even hit them when they make mistakes."	S_T1
"They think it can prevent their children to make mistakes."	B_T0
"However, some people think parents should allow their children to make mistakes, because  they may learn from their wrong way."	I_T0
"I think we should let them go when they make mistakes, there is a proverb that a fall into the pit, a gain in your wit."	E_T0
"Letting the children make mistakes does not mean letting them make same mistakes again, parents should let the children awaring the why they make mistake and how to avoid it teh next time by themselves."	S_M2
"On the contary, if parents tell them do not make mistakes, it can not let them realize what they are do is wrong, but just following their parents said, so they will make some same types of mistakes as well."	B_S0
"For example, my friends David broke some plates while he was playing with his friends in his home."	I_S0
"When his parents went home seeing these, they did not say anything like tell David do not make mistakes."	I_S0
"At dinnertime, David found that his parents did not prepare any food for him!"	I_S0
"He was angry, and asked his parents."	I_S0
"His parents just told him, the plate is not enough, the food is nowhere to fill."	I_S0
"Soon David knew his errancy, he does not play with friends in the kitchen anymore, because he knew that plate broken, no food for him by himself."	E_S0
"Meanwhlie, the process to correct the mistakes can also inspired children, like Edison, if his parents told him do not make mistakes, he could not learn from the mistakes and after conduct 99 experiments, learn from the latter mistake over and over again, he would not produce the bulb,and we would use fire to light right now,"	S_S2
"Therefore, wise parents may allow their children to make mistakes, believing them will learn from mistakes and avoiding doing mistakes the next time."	S_C2
 
"When we feel tired it doesn't means our body  need relax  but our brain doesn't want to work ."	S_T1
"I am a student of senior high school which means I have to keep on studing for hours  and just have few hours for rest everyday,I will get tired and don't want move when I got home ."	B_S0
"That's why I prefer to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing phyisical exercise ."	I_S0
"But for those  who have many time for relaxing ,I think they can relax themselves  by watching movies and reading books ,if it works then they can back to work again."	I_S0
"But if they had  relaxed for a long time and still feel stressful ,they'd better do some exercise to relese their body                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               For diffrent stuation we should choose diffrent way to relax ."	I_S0

"In present-day society  people are attaching more important  to the  rubbish problems."	S_T1
"It seems to be a huge problem that our world is facing to deal with rubbish problems."	B_S0
"In the following essay , I will state those issues and relevant prossible measures."	I_S0
"The major cause is that people life quality is improving, so people would buy increasingly food with plastic packaging."	I_S0
"For example, after  people eat food, they would discard the palstic packaging which is diffcult to be resolved by environment."	I_S0
"The another contributing factor involves the population are a dramatic increase, therefore the goods comsumption is raising and the household refuse numerous more."	I_S0
"In addition, we should not ignore the lack of the land resouces."	I_S0
"There are more lands are  used to city development like constructe infrastractures and flats."	I_S0
"so the land which use to deal with the rubbish is numerous less."	I_S0
"According to  mentioned above, various approaches should be adopted to deal with these problems."	I_S0
"One effective approach to solve the problem is that the government should bulid numerous cycling stations , which makes the garbage cycling use."	I_S0

"They can help students to get some useful skills such as mathematic skills while history can not do that."	I_S0
"students without Science and Technology lack of logical thinkings."	I_S0
"History can not let students gain logical thinkings as Science and Techonology can."	I_S0
"Science and Technology can also benefit on students' careers more than history."	I_S0
"Students of Science and Technology are competent in their careers,they can do many technological works such as engineer and architects,The direction of students whose major is history can only be scholars or searchers in their future."	I_S0

"Nowadays it has sparked a heated discussion among the public that why many people are learn a foreign language."	S_I0
"Some poeple believe that the only reason for leanring a foreign language is doing so can make it easier while traveling or working in a foreign country, while others argue that these are not the only reason."	S_T0
"It is no doubt that for many people, since they are living in their homeland, it indeed is not neccessary for them to learn another language apart from their native ones unless they are going abroad for a tour or for work."	S_M1
"Situation works like this when considering from a rich's perspective."	S_S2
"However, for most people, learning a foreign language has a greater purpose than that."	S_M1
"First of all, a foreign language, mostly English in those none English speaking country, is a compulsory subject for all students."	B_S0

"It seems in recent years the opinion swings from one extreme to the other."	E_I0
"This essay will look at the arguments regarding this hot issue."	O
"One of the more compelling arguments for universities providing graduates with expertise for their future careers finds its origins in economics."	S_M1
"Parents have been investing in their children’s college studies in hope that they will earn a decent job with stable salary."	B_S0
"Consequently, career preparation is becoming increasingly vital to the young people, especially in today's tight labor market with fewer jobs than before."	I_S0
"Some people thus have called for universities to be more vocation-oriented because that way not only the graduates’ employment rates would be enhanced but the students be motivated for being given an opportunity to succeed in their future professions."	I_S0
"From a helicopter view, in countries, particularly developing ones, the economic advances need numerous professional talents in the fields like finance, management, legislation, medicine, thereby putting universities in a pivotal position of nurturing these professionals."	E_S0
"However, reaching the conclusion that other functions, such as giving access to knowledge for its own sake, are no longer important is biased."	S_M1
"For hundreds of years, especially in the west, the undergraduate education is, indeed, a liberal education, which means the undergraduates learn a wide range of curriculums such as psychology, economics, politics that has no direct relations to jobs."	B_S1
"The upsides of this is that it firstly enables students to become broad-minded and help them lay a solid theoretical foundation, then they will be able to choose the most appropriate field based on their own interests for further studies."	E_S1
"Personally, without suggesting that imparting career-oriented knowledge and skills is the sole function of modern universities, I think it is by no means a less important one."	S_C2
"In any way, it is now increasingly acting as a gauge for judging a university and therefore becoming one of the primary functions of a university."	S_S2

"In my opinion, I believe it is important for us to know events happening in different countries; it is not neccessary to know all of them, but the more we know, the better for ourselves."	S_T0
"First of all, Reading international newspaper is a good method to know all the important events that just happened around the world."	S_M1
"International newspaper contains not only domestic news, but also foreign news."	B_S0
"I usually read the newspaper every morning when I am eating my breakfast."	I_S0

"People like to discuss news, especially international news during the coversation."	I_S0
"They think international news are interesting and giving them more imagination space because this is something that far away from them."	I_S0
"Knowing international news will help me to join the conversation more easily and is a good method to find topics to communicate with people."	E_S0

"However, some people believe that other types of progress are as significant as economic progress for a country."	B_S0
"Personally, I bileve that it is likely to need more than economic progress."	I_S0
"Above all, military is significant du to one imprtant part of country's goal."	I_S0
"If we don not develop military, it can be hard for us to preserve our own country."	I_S0
"For a prime example, there was highly developed economy in Song Dynasty, while its military was totally weak."	I_S0
"As a result of that the government forced to cut the territory to send to other countries as a present in order to prevent the war."	I_S0
"As people all know that the Song Dynasty died out due to the reason of weak military."	I_S0
"On the other hand, from some aspects, it is more important to protect environment, instead of developing economy."	I_S0
"It can be said that the development of economy is baed on good environment."	I_S0
"There is an example to prove it."	I_S0
"Morano was a renown country in the period of the Han Dynasty."	I_S0
"However, the reason why such a beautiful died out quikly was due to the fact that it overused resources, such as trees and water."	I_S0
"It was hard to develop economy in such a terrible circumstance."	I_S0
"On the top of that, the whole country turned into desert bit by bit."	I_S0
"After several decades, the country vanished from the world forever."	I_S0
"Thus, it can be clearly seen that not only economy, but also other aspects, such as military and environment, play a significant role in achieving our country's goals."	E_S0
 
"The history of a country is a very important part of the country's culture."	S_I0
"And with the development of the tecenology and the ecnomic a lot of people seem to forget the history of their own coutry."	S_T1
"But in my opinion I think the university student should be required to take history courses on no matter what their field."	S_T0
"This is because, the history could give them a sense of  they responsibility and could let students know more the culture of their country."	S_S2
"The history courses could let the student know they should devote their knowledge to build these country, because the peace of this country is very tough."	S_M1
"When I study in a public high school, no matter how busy we were we will not stop the history class."	B_S0
"The history teacher told us the story of the heros in our country detect the invation of the Japenese empire."	I_S0

"They gave up every thing of them just want to protect their country."	I_S0
"The classmates of our class all feel very thanksful."	I_S0
"The last generation gave up their life to provide a wonderful enviroment to us."	I_S0
"We all think that we should study and contribute to our country like tham."	I_S0
"Since these we study harder than before and love our country very much."	I_S0
"The universities are the places that have a lot of talent, they are the future of a country."	I_S0
"If they feel a sense of responsibilty to their country, they will do more things to their country."	E_S0
"Second, the inforemation that we get from the history class could use in some other subject, and it could broaden our herizon."	S_M1

"I disagree that it is better to relax emotionally than realx physically."	S_T0
"Physical exercise can provide people with truly relax while emotional work will let them feel less comfortable."	S_M1
"Nowadays, people will have a lot of pressure from a whole day's work."	B_S0
"They may feel tired and sleepy."	I_S0
"At this time, if they watch a movie, they will get annoyed by the noisy music or awaken by the scaring stories."	I_S0
"It is not helpful for them to go to sleep later."	I_S0
"In the same theory, if they read a book, they may feel uncomfortable at their sleepy eyes and they will not be so focused on the book any more."	I_S0
"So realxing by watching a movie or reading a book is not suggested."	I_S0
"However, doing some physical exercise will make people energetic to deal with the next period of work."	I_S0
"It will also help to keep fit."	I_S0
"Thus, I advise that people should relax by doing exercise rather than by watching a movie or reading a book."	E_S0
"Besides, realxing physically is a human being's natural action."	S_M1
"We all know that the most comfotble period of time of a human being is childhood."	B_S0
"For children, they can not understand what a movie is talking about or what a book is saying."	I_S0
"All they can enjoy for a whole day is to play games and to chase each other endlessly."	I_S0
"It is like that in human nature, the best way to relax is based on physical movement but emotional promotion."	I_S0
"For an adult, we should also follow this natural rule to realx physically after a tiring day's mental work."	E_S0
"Judging from the reasons provided above, I think it is better to relax by doing physical exercise than realx by watching a movie or reading a book."	S_C2
 
"Young people are ofen told not to do this and not to do that."	S_T0
"And I would think about a question that whether the rules that societies today expect young people to follow are too strict."	S_T1
"Some people would say yes, but I think it is not too strict."	S_T0
"For the first reason, the rules are good for the young's safety."	S_M1
"For example,the young are told not go to bars."	B_S0
"This is because there are many people would may be dangerous there."	I_S0
"Since people in the bars would probably drunk, they may hit the young by accident."	I_S0
"Also, the alcohol is bad for the young's bodies, so telling them not go to the bar is a way to protect them."	E_S0
"Scondly, the rules can help the young to keep healthy."	S_M1
"Take an instance, it is common that the young are not allowed to go to internet bars."	B_S0
"I thinks this is good for the young."	I_S0
"Staying in frount of the computer screen without moving for a long time is very harmful to the young's eyes and badies."	I_S0
"And when they playing computer games in the internet bars, there would be no parents to let them stop."	I_S0
"Thus, they might probably even forget to have their meals."	I_S0
"And their badies would get hurt in this way."	I_S0
"For this reason, the rules is a method to help the young to keep healthy."	E_S0
"Admittedly, the young would have fewer things to have fun because of the rules."	B_C0
"However, the rules do not affect all things in their life."	I_C0
"The young can still go outside with friends to strengthen their friendships and have fun as well."	I_C0
"And the posibilities of being hurt would be reduce becuase of those rules."	I_C0
"So I think the rules that societies today expect young people to follow are not too strict."	E_C0
"They not only stallow the young to do many things"	O

"Nowadays,people tend to see more foreign movies than domestic movies."	B_I0
"Whether this phenomenon brings more advantages than disadvantages is a hot issue."	E_I0
"I believe the benefits of this trendency far outweight its negative impact."	S_T0

"In the lecture, the speaker casts doubt on the reading passage's viewpoint that TEDs have many criticisms."	B_I0
"However, she argues that TEDs still need to be used in turtle's protection, which contradicts what the reading states."	I_I0
"And in the lecture, she uses three specific points to confirm her idea."	E_I0
"First, even though the article suggests that the possibility for turtles getting trapped is very low according to shrimpers, the professor thinks in the lecture that there are thousands of turtles trapped every year and they are all small."	S_M0
"So if they kill many young turtles , the future of turtles will be destroyed."	S_S2
"Moreover, despite the statement in the reading that limiting the working time of shrimp boats are more effective than TEDs to protect sea turtles, the speaker contends that this way is hard to make it."	S_M0
"She supports this point with the fact that government couldn't ask every shrimpers to work and rest simultaneously."	B_S1
"And turtles are different, you can't make sure every turtle can have a chance to survive."	E_S1
"Lastly, the lecture asserts that some large species of sea turtles are not able to escape from TEDs whereas the author of the reading claims that this problem is easy to solve."	S_M0

there is no way they kowe what is she look like."	S_S2
"Secoond ,the writer elaborates the sketch,whtich is known depicts Austen."	S_M1
"It contain the details of Jane as a teenager."	B_S1
"but the speakerconfutes the writer as: It's a big family and there are many teenager as Jane's age,so ,you can not sure it is Jane."	E_S1

"It is true that many schools are troubled by students’ behavioral problems."	S_T1
"There are various reasons for this phenomenon, but measures could be taken to tackle the problem
In many countries, the birth rate is decreasing so that families are smaller with fewer children."	B_S0
"These children are often spoilt, not in terms of love and attention because working parents do not have the time for this, but in more material ways."	I_S0
"They are allowed to have whatever they want, regardless of price, and to behave as they please."	I_S0
"This means that the children grow up without consideration for others and without any understanding of where their standard of living comes from."	E_S0
 
"Nowadays, as a result of economic growth, the incomes of people are increasing and they start to consume more goods than the past."	S_T0
"However, some people get to be in debt because of buying goods, which they do not actually need and could not pay."	S_T1
"In my opinion, it is very important to prevent people from getting trapped in this problem."	S_T0
"In the first place, there are several reasons for this behaviour."	S_M1
"One of the most important catalysts is the psychological problem."	B_S0
"For instance, when some people are upset and disappointed, they tend to go shopping and buy everything they want."	I_S0
"In this situation, because of their loose of control, they could not consider the things whether they need or not."	I_S0
"Equally important, another reason is their temporary desire."	I_S0
"To specify, at some moments, people always have the ambition to possess something, which is not normally necessary for them and out of their financial situation."	I_S0
"Therefore, they will make a purchasing decision without assessing the benefits and drawbacks."	I_S0
"Credit cards, purchase cards, gift cards etc. are more available nowadays and having a credit card from a band is easier than ever before."	I_S0
"These shorts of cards and loans allure people to purchase more luxury items they can live without."	I_S0
"While repaying, people get trapped and the high-interest rates increase the loan amount significantly."	E_S0
"Admittedly, this behaviour could bring people into a very dangerous situation."	S_M1
"Hence, the government, as well as the community, should take place some solutions to deal with it."	B_S0
"Firstly, every store or shopping centre should control their customer purchasing by checking their financial status."	I_S0
"As a consequence, it will restrict people in buying the items, which they cannot afford."	I_S0
"Moreover, we should organise some psychological course for people, who have problems with shopping."	I_S0
"Lastly, the sale staffs of shops should advise and give a good recommendation to their, which enable them to have the best choice."	I_S0
"Banks should be more rigid while approving the credit card to a person and the credit limit should be within the affordable amount by the card holder."	E_S0
"In summary, to avoid getting into debt, everyone should consider both advantages and disadvantages of the products before buying it."	B_C0
"Someone should not simply purchase a product because of pure luxury or pride."	I_C0
"The repayment should also be considered at the time of purchasing."	E_C0
 
"In the reading material, the author claims that the decline of reading literature will make a harmful impact on our culture."	S_I0
"The professor, however, contradicts this view for the following reasons."	S_T0
"Firstly, the reading material alludes to the fact that we will miss the intellectual stimulation that can be caused by literature, yet the professor asserts that not only ilterature but aslo other good books can stimulate the brain."	S_M0
"This is because others books like science book, history book and so can stimulate the imagination as well."	S_S2
"Secondly, quiet different from the point made in the reading material that if we spend more time on entertainments instead of literature, the level of our culture will be lower."	S_M0
"the professor argues that it will not happen, she proves her statement by presenting some relative evidence that the brillant song and good moive are available as well."	B_S1
"Furthermore, sometimes they influence us more directly."	E_S1
"Thirdly, in the reading, the author maintains that beacuse of the decline of reader, the writer's condition is more serious, while the professor views this issue from an opposite angle."	S_M0
"According to her, the writer also have responsibility."	B_S0
"It is based on the fact that some passages are too difficult to understand."	I_S0

"Some claim that it is good for us to prepare food step by step, while others deem that cooking in 20 years must be faster than today."	E_I0
"Contrary to their views comes my perspective that we will spend less time preparing foods in twenty years."	S_T1
"To begin with, the development of technology in twenty years will allow us to reduce cooking time, which can make us easier to get foods."	S_M1
"This is because the new technical appliances will make the cooking process more efficiency."	B_S0
"For example, we didn't have microwave ovens twenty years ago, so it was hard for us to cook dinner for our family."	I_S0
"But since we developed the microwaves, it has accelerated our cooking process."	I_S0
"It only takes us few minutes to prepare meals."	I_S0
"So I believe that in twenty years, there wll also be a booming development of cooking appliance that can increase the cooking efficiency."	E_S0
"In addition, the creed of being productivity has been adopted by many corporations that is considered to be consistend with the booming economy."	S_M1
"So how to save time in our life has been the prority of consideration by us."	B_S0
"Therefore, the cooking time must be decreased."	I_S0
"A good example in point is that a good friend of mine called Jack."	I_S0
"He is working in Apple."	I_S0
"He always complain to me that he always have no time cooking."	I_S0
"So, we can safely say that the cooking time must be reduced in 20 years."	E_S0
"From what we discussed above, we can safely draw a conclusion that we will spend less time cooking and preparing food in twenty yeats than what we do today."	B_C1
"Because it is not only a result of the development of techniques but it can aslo guarantee our working pruductivity."	E_C1

"Recently there is a heated discussion regarding which type of friends is better for people to make with."	B_I0
"Attitudes towards this issue vary from individuals to individuals."	I_I0
"There is a common conception that it is worth to make friends with intelligent people."	E_I0
"However, from my perspective, I strongly believe that people should be contact with humor people."	S_T0
"My view will be explained by analyzing the following reasons."	S_T1
"One reason why I am in favor of the point is that humor people enable people to deal with problems in an easy way."	S_M0
"This is largely due to the fact that humor people can help people to get out of nagetive areas and treat issues with positive attitudes."	B_S0
"Taking myself for example, when I was in middle school, I was so upset because I still fell my math exams even I spent plenty of time on math courses."	I_S0
"Fortunately, my best friend Jane dicovered my unusual emotions."	I_S0
"She always told me some jokes which were happened around us."	I_S0
"After jokes, she would teach me some solutions to deal with my math problems according to her experiences."	I_S0
"I found that I was willing to accept her suggestions because her jokes relaxed my nervous feelings."	I_S0
"As a result, I achieved a decend academic record in next math exam."	I_S0
"As the example shows, humor people allow people to accept their opinions and find an easy way to solve the problems."	E_S0
"Another reason used to support my opinion is that humor people can lead people to positive emotions when they are confront with troubles."	S_M0
"This is because humor people always smile at you, and their positive emotions will effect you to be positive as they are."	B_S0
"Campared with serious people who always remind people what the mistakes they have, humor people do not tell people the problems directly, they will use some ways people can accept by their jokes."	I_S0
"In additions, people are more willing to make friends with these humor people, because people feel comfortable to stay with them."	E_S0
"Admittedly, people need to make friends with intelligent people."	S_M0
"This group of individuals can bring knowledge which people do not understand to abroden people's horizons."	B_S0
"However, if people can not accept these knowledge, they will ignore those friends."	I_S0
"Hence, it is not useful for people."	I_S0
"On the opposite, humor people always have ways to make people feel happy and accept their ideas."	E_S0

"Reading suggests three different theories about how agnostids may have lived."	B_I0
"However, in the lecture, the professor is skeptical about all these three ideas, with following reasons."	I_I0
"In the reading passage, author thinks that the agnostids may have been free-swimming predators that hunted smaller animals, because other types of primitive arthropods were strong swimmers."	I_I0
"On the contrary, the professor says that all those active predators have big and well-developed eyes, which will be a good tool for them to track their pray."	I_I0
"But agnostids has tiny and poorly-developed eyes, even sometimes absolutly blind!"	E_I0
"So they must have some other well-developed organizon to help them catch their pray."	B_S1
"However, there is no evidence to prove it."	E_S1
"The professor then opposes the reading's idea that agnostids may have dwelled on the seafloor because of  the finding that there are some examples of other types of primitive arthropods living this way."	S_M2
"The professor states that seafloor dwellers usually haven't the ability to move so fast or so far."	B_S0
"they always occupy a small place for a long time without finding other new place."	I_S0

"Nowdays, people are more and more realiable on technology and most of them didn't aware of this."	S_I0
"But, doing this have advantages and disadvantages."	S_T1
"Firstly, technology can make us live more easily."	S_T0
"Now, people do everything on phones, pay on phones, chat on phones,  work on phones......"	B_S0
"There's no problem if you forget to bring your wallet on the way you buy things if you have a smart phone with you."	I_S0

"An interesting discussion has aroused a controversy among public: children should spend more time on doing homework and praticipating some activities related to school or doing whatever they want."	B_T1
"Althoug some people claim that children will feel boring if they spend more time on school's arrangement, I strong believe that it is great for children's future to spend more time on school's arrangement."	I_T1
"My reasons and examples canbe elaborated as follows."	E_T1
"Firstly, spending more time on doing homework or participating in organized activities related to school or sports will enable children to plan their time better."	S_M2
"As children are young, it is kind of difficult for them to concentrate on something, which makes them usually spend little time on several activities."	B_S0
"As a result, kids wil waste lots of precious time if they do not have a clear time planning."	I_S0
"So it is indispensable"	E_S0
 
"Nowadays more and more students have faced the same situation that they studying negative and have to leave school."	S_T0
"This phenomenon have been focoused by many people."	B_S0
"As far as i am concerned,there are there reasons that may cause this phenomenon."	I_S0
"Firstly,the way of school's teaching is the most important cause."	I_S0
"For an extance,if the teacher  is just serious about students' degree but has no connection with the thoughts of students,of course,the students won't be willing to turn to the teacher for help."	I_S0
"No one wants to ask question,how can the students make progress?"	I_S0
"Secondly,when it comes to the students,we often would like to know more about his/her growing environment and his/her family."	I_S0
"There is no doubt that family has great influnence on the students."	I_S0
"Different family will bring up different students."	I_S0
"Like Michel,although her father just a normal pump repairer and even her family is really poor,her father realized he had to lead to his child having the best education."	I_S0
"Luckily,she has such a good father,she had no negative thoughts on studying and tried her best to the offer of Haverd."	I_S0
"Last but not least,the reason about theirselves shouldn't be irrgeranted."	I_S0
"For most students,they may have great teacher who would like to make friends with them and also have easy-going family members,but they still give up studying."	I_S0
"I think they must really realize themselve and don't know what people they want to be in the future."	I_S0
"Therefore they enjoy what they have now and what situation they are in and don't want to change or challenge anything."	I_S0
"Just like this score,it's ok,not too bad."	I_S0
"Maybe they will think like this."	I_S0
"This thought is problem."	I_S0
"Hope this phenomenon won't exit no longer."	I_S0
"Soon people will take measures to deal with it and help students have bright future !"	E_S0
 
"As the world's rapid globalization, products of certain countries can be easily bought in almost every place of the world, and it makes countries that used to be different become similar."	B_T1
"In my conviction, it's not a good sign."	E_T1
"To some extent, having more access to all different products around the world does inprove people's life standard and offer them brand new experence."	S_M0
"Without these products, many people who have inadequate funds to travel wouldn't get the chance to explore the exotic life of foreign areas."	S_S2
"However, buying the same products everywhere may prevent people's annovation for new idea."	S_M0
"Since all the products people are encountering are all the same, it's obvious that people's mind will be restricted because they basicly live the exact same life."	S_S2
"What's worse, countries become gradually similar may destroy the unique treassure of culture in each country."	S_M0
"For example, many people in China, especially teenagers, are keen on the culture of other countries but ignore or even despite on our own."	B_S1
"I'm always afraid that all those precious things that symbolize China's history would vanish one by another, due to those people who should support them but have shown no cocern."	E_S1
"In conclusion, I do believe that great benefit can be brought to people's daily life as they can experience  the amazing products from all around the world."	B_C1
"But we must pay attention to the greater damage this might brought to us, not only in what and how we think, but also our slowly dying culture which we definately couldn't bear the consequence of losing."	E_C1
 
"There is a debate on what kind of subjects should students be taught by schools."	S_T1
"Some people believe that students should only receive academic knowledge from school while others think students also need to learn how to distinguish right from wrong."	B_S0
"From my perspective, they both have advantages and schools need to find a balance point to teach students to improve students' abilities from different aspects."	I_S0
"It is acceptable that some people think their children supposed to learn professional lessons in school."	I_S0
"As employment pressure increasing, mastering more knowledge means students can be well prepared for the future emplyment."	I_S0
"In additon, by learning vocational skill and employability will enable the students to find their own niches society."	I_S0
"For instance, provided schools teach children learn English over 10 years, some students with excellent skills on it might speak English as fluent as possible, so they can easily qualified some jobs and have a chance to work aboard."	I_S0
"On the contrase, others argue that teaching students to distinguish right and wrong are also important for them, so schools need teach it aprt from normal acadecim education."	I_S0
"Not only the students study courses in school but also cummunicate with their peers."	I_S0
"Therefore, they might have some conflicts between them."	I_S0
"If they don't receive some proper education on it, they might do some bad behaviours such as hitting their firiend, which would have a unpleasant memory on the victim."	I_S0
"In general, both two vies are vital to student's future development."	I_S0
"Without enough academic knowledge we can not find the dream job as we want, also, students who can't discriminate right and wrong will face problems in society."	I_S0
"Therefore, I insist that schools need to find the balance between the subject teaching and moral education to teach students."	E_S0
 
"With the development of society, people's living conditions are improving."	S_I0
"And I think there are too many choices for people to choose from."	B_T0
"On the one hand, more and more companies like economic globalization."	I_T0
"These companies can not only provide enough jobs for people, they can also provide many of products for people."	E_T0
"However, in the past, there were not so many companies and many people had to choose to spend their day on the farm and do their own business."	S_S2
"On the other hand, people's life is better now than in the past, which means they have more money and can buy more things now."	S_M1
"We can see that the rich have many choices to show their social status when buying luxuries, while the ordinary people are richer than before, most of them can buy what they want."	S_S2
"Last but not least, appear of the Internet has made a great contribution to the choice of more and more people."	S_M1
"At present, we can even sell our new or used things on the Internet."	B_S1
"However, in the past, we didn't have such a platform to sell things we didn't need."	E_S1
"In conclusion, I agree that with the development of society and economy, as well as the emergence of the Internet, people are now faced with too many choices."	S_C2
 
"Just let your kids make mistakes
  With the rapid developement of society, we have more chances to get success."	B_T1
"However, the chances of making mistakes are also higher."	I_T1
"As for the hot topic, an argument has been waged concerning about whether should we let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes."	E_T1
"As far as i am concerned, parents should give their children a comfortable atmosphere which makes sure kids have the courage of chanlleging, even though they may make some mistakes."	S_M2
"First of all, as an old Chinanse saying goes' Failure is the mother of success' ,which inllustrates the great importance of making mistakes."	B_S0
"Then, another point worth mentioning is that only if you making enough mistakes, you should get knowledge of the significance of success."	I_S0
"It means geting success by following your parents' 'right' ways step by step will enforce you underestimate the meaning"	E_S0
 
"The chart below compares the energy used in an Australian family house and the CO2 emissions in the environment caused due to the use of energy."	B_I0
"The charts shows that majority of energy consumption and CO2 emissions are due to heating used for various purposes."	E_I0
"In a typical Australian house, 42 percent of energy is used for heating rooms."	S_M0
"The other major use of energy accounts for water heating which uses 32% of total energy."	B_S0
"Next, the other appliances such as toasters, gas and stoves used in kitchens uses up 15 percent of energy."	I_S0

"On the contrary, other appliances causes 28 percent of emission."	B_S1
"While, its not absolutely shocking to see 32 percent of CO2 emission is caused due to water heating appliances such as geysers."	E_S1
"Though, refrigerators consumes a little energy, the emissions caused due it accounts for twice the amount of energy used by it."	S_M0
"Cooling appliances such as air conditioner or fans and electricity used for lighting bulbs accounts only for 3 and 8 percent respectively."	S_S2

"However, there are some problems about entertainment on TV channels appearing."	B_S0
"Frankly speaking, i think it has adventages and disadventages."	I_S0
"We should deal with them."	I_S0
"First of all, TV could enrich our leisure time and make us view the world easily."	I_S0
"For example, we could see what we need on the TV and has more choices about those porductions."	I_S0
"To my humble point, it is more convenient for us to choose high quality products."	I_S0
"What is more, we could enjoy great shows like Spring Festival Show which makes us feel our society are strengthing."	I_S0
"Every day there are going on fresh news, and we could know that on TV which builds a bridge between all over the world."	I_S0
"It has been an important part to our life."	I_S0
"From another view, many insipide channels lead us to bad situation."	I_S0
"Advertising gives us more choices, but some of them are fake and quality is poor."	I_S0
"I recken government should conduct TV channels, close the bad one and develop the good ."	I_S0
"We can not stop programming TV channels, but we could choose them."	I_S0
"Of course, the maker of film or tv show should be creative to their porgrams and give us power of fresh air."	I_S0

"Friendship is indispensable in our life,and it do bring happiness to people."	S_T1
"However, there's a question:"Is it matters more to maintian an old friend's relationship than to make new friends?""	S_T0
"My answer is absolutely "Yes"."	S_T1
"Admittedly, we can get pleasure from the freshness by making new friends."	S_M0
"However, the relationship among old friends is more likely to play an important role for one's happiness."	S_S2
"First of all, old friend is the person who understand you the most."	S_M0
"We have friendship with our old friends for a long time, so they know our hobbies and characters well."	B_S0

"But everything has its pros and cons."	I_S0
"We can not ignore the disadvantages either."	I_S0
"So here comes the question:whether the advantages of this development can outweigh the disadvantages."	I_S0
"In my point of view,I favor that the positive effects  can offset or even exceed the negative ones."	I_S0
"Firstly,now with the aid of advanced technology,we can achieve many things that used to be thought impossible besides arriving at the South Pole."	I_S0
"For example ,our ancestors nver imagined flying to the moon."	I_S0
"But since the first astronaut's arriving on the surface of the moon, we have made a giant leap in the expendition and exploration to the infinite universe outside our earth."	I_S0

"The increasing number and type of electronical devices as well as domestic appliances have improved our living standards by providing many choices."	I_S0
"The main argument about the disadvantages is that the technological crime and artificial intelligence's replacing humans."	I_S0
"As far as I am concerned,it is the wrong user who is to blame for the their criminal behaviours rather than the technology itself."	I_S0
"So the relative regulations and punishment should be set specially for standerdizing the human."	I_S0
"It is so unwise and rough of critics to exaggrate the bad influences of technology."	I_S0
"So it is the same with the reasonable ues of aritificial intelligence."	E_S0
 
"As far as I am concerned, the practice of giving money to chidren who achieve high grades as a reward has a positive effect on the growth of chidren."	B_T0
"Reasons are as follows."	E_T0
"First of all, money acts as an encouragement to chidren when they perform well in tests."	S_M0
"When educating chidren, especially those who are at such a young age that they are not likey to be interested in the boring studying, the reward means a recognition of all the efforts they make."	B_S0
"Chidren tend to work harder to get the rewards and prase, which makes it easier to form a good habit of learning."	I_S0
"My young brother is naughty and used to be bored with studying, but nowadayshe always get high grades in every test because he can win a toy he want and get the chance to play games if he succeed to be top3 in the exam."	E_S0
"What's more, with money in hand,chidren are required to learn to do their own finacial management."	S_M0
"They can make choice s between spending money right now or saving for future use."	B_S0
"During the practice of using money,chidren keep thinking about the why and how they will use their money,whcih is beneficial to their future life when they grow up as an independent individual."	I_S0
"Take my roommate Luo for example."	I_S0
"Luo is a clever people because he makes some investments in stock market in free time and earns some money."	I_S0
"He was asked to spend his money on his own at a young age so he knows the importance of management and never waste his money nowadays."	E_S0
"I have to admit that using money as rewards do has some drawbacks."	S_M0
"Chidren who do not have a strong mind may use money for too much toys or pay too much attention to money rather than knowledge."	B_S1
"But with the in-time and correct guidance of parents,these circumstances can be avioded effectively."	E_S1
"To summrize,using money as the reward to chidren who get high grades in the exams is adoptive because it encourage them to do better in exams and learn how to use money in right ways."	S_C2
 
"Yes,l do think this is addod idea."	B_T0
"Actually,a lot of children do not want to study in thier hearts."	I_T0

"So,in the last,even the Obama couple did not give them moneny,the daughters will also finish the tasks that their parents and school give them."	B_S0
"This is just an exmple of the thousands of examples,but from this example,we can know that this educational way is actually effective."	I_S0
"And we can use this means to inspire children to study,just as Ombama couplesd did."	E_S0
"On the other hand,just in the society we work,praise and award is so normal that we can see it wherever we go."	S_M1
"So givng children praise and award in this way can help them know this world earlier,and let them know how the world and the society run.l do argue this is an effective and simple way to make us achieve this."	S_S2
"And my opinion is above,and l'm sure we can make our children more better.l can't agree this more."	S_C2
 
"With the advent of international trade and better transportation, product accessibility is becoming ever present in the global village."	S_I0
"The advantages and disadvantages of this development are further discussed in the following paragraphs."	S_T1
"One positive impact is that business and individual consumers can purchase native products when they are abroad."	S_M2
"There are numerous imported and exported goods that people don't need to bring them from their hometowns."	B_S0
"For instance, when Chinese people live in western countries feeing homesick, they can easily find Chinese-flavored spices and ingredients in the Chinatowns."	I_S0
"Undoubtedly, having more approachable way to feel at home is essential to those people who are in need, and they can benefit from this development."	E_S0

"In the past few decades, it has been an obvious tendency for students and adolescents to receive their academic education with a multiple opportunities, studying in foreign country is also becoming increasingly popular especially for the mega city family."	S_I0
"Although there stand some inevitable drawbacks, I personally believe that the advantages are of much greater significance in many fronts."	S_T1
"Apparently, as abundant students chasing their education process abroad, some positive effects and justification will imposed in the schools of China."	S_M1
"Some students in China intend to study in other countries merely for the reason that they are tired of the domestic education system."	B_S0
"There is no need to illustrate the cruel examination and the mere chance for the majority of students to get better leaning resource."	I_S0
"It is, however, a better solution for Chinese bureau to reflect the existing problem owing to these parents and their children."	E_S0
"Apart from the merit above, it is the students themselves that benefit the most from the period of gaining knowledge abroad."	S_M1
"Definitely, they are more likely to master at least one foreign language, which is an important strong point for them in the future job market."	B_S1
"Being able to make more foreign friends will also give them more opportunities as well as increasing their confidence and ability to handle the task with those from different background."	E_S1
"Although there are still some handicaps for children in a total  unfamiliar environment when studying and living abroad, ranging from the culture adapt and motherland sickness, these are with no doubt the drawbacks that could be overcome as time gradually goes by."	B_C1
"In conclusion, I support the advantages are more important."	E_C1
 
"Under the tendency of globalization, people tend to master a foreign language for various reasons."	S_T0
"Some believe the only reason is that foreign languages help them to experience the lives in foreign countries."	B_S0
"Although this view is embraced by many, others insist that there should be other reasons for people to learn a new language."	I_S0
"Some people state that the fundamental function of a language is to communicate, so the only reason for people to learn a new language is for working or travelling in other countries."	I_S0
"Learning a new language is time-consuming, it is kind of waste if people learn a language but not use it."	I_S0
"Ones can start their lives and works in a foreign country once they master the local language, in this way they truely realise the function of a language."	I_S0
"On the contrary, the opponents do have their points that there are other reasons for learning languages."	I_S0
"In the compentaray age, many people learning a foreign language is to protect the endangerous languages and diversity of culture."	I_S0
"This is due to the facts that people tend to use one common language in order to communicate with people around the world, such as English, neglecting the transmition and development of scare languages."	I_S0
"Therefore, the language will die out once the old people were gone."	I_S0
"It is considerably necessary for young people to learn this language for the purpose of conservation."	I_S0
"From my perspective, integrating into the local area is the most popular purpose for people to learn other languages."	I_S0
"But people  should also pay attention to the other shiny traits of language."	E_S0

"So we don't have time to help the strangers when we walk on the street."	E_T1
"Secondly, people don't believe in each other because many of us have the experience of be cheated."	B_S0
"For example, when someone walk on the street, some stange poor guys will ask you for your money or some food, but actualy they are not poor, or when you are driving on the road, a men fall in front of your car and said that he is hurted by you but you did't."	I_S0

"It's vrey common nowadays that  parents reward their kids with money, usually for good performance at school, because they think it can motivate and dirve their kids to face those eldless homework and boring class."	B_I0
"But, is this a really good idea?"	E_I0
"I doubt it very much."	S_T0
"First, using money as reward will make kids feel that study is a kind of goods exchange, which is harmful for their value about study."	S_M1
"Once kids realize that they can earn money just by studying and getting good grades, they will begin to take study as a kind of job--parents are the bosses, and they are the employees."	B_S0
"Then they will study hard for profits and "salary" instead of knowlegy and skill."	I_S0
"In that way, study becomes a burden and task for them."	I_S0
"They won't get the true meaning and goal of study."	I_S0
"But in fact, study is for their own benefit and it's a good preparation for their life."	E_S0
"Besides, getting money as reward will lead the kids to become more material."	S_M1
"They will think that money is more important than anything else because their parents' behavior indicated that."	B_S0
"Situations as follows may happen as time goes by: when you ask your son to fetch today's newspaper for you, he will imediately reply "one dollar"; when you ask him to wash dishes or sweep the floor, he may answer:  " You have to pay me"."	I_S0
"How horrible it is!"	I_S0
"School kids tend to be influenced easily by their surroundings, especially the behavior of their parents."	I_S0

"The professor think that the passage's information are convincing but the burning mirror is still available."	S_I0
"First of all, the passage states that the Greeks were unavailable to build such a giant and precise weapon."	S_M0
"To refute this point, the professor says that the Greeks needn't to build a whole mirror, and they only need to assemble small pieces of the mirror."	S_S2
"Secondly, the passage says that the mirror need about 10 minute to set a ship on fire, and it is obviously inefficient."	S_M0
"However the professor explains that  the Roman navy use a material called pitch to make their ship water-proof, but pitch is easy to catch fire so as a matter of fact, the mirror only need 10 second to ignite the ship."	S_S2
"As to the last point, the passage thinks that the Greeks have already got flaming arrows and they don't need to invent burning mirror."	S_M0
"According to the professor, Roman navy were already familiar with flaming arrows and  can put out the fire easily, however, the burning mirror are more magical and surprising, and may have a unexpected results."	S_S2

"lamb and chicken were eaten in similar quantities (around 150 grams),while mach less fish was consumed(just over 50 grams)."	S_S2
"However,during this 25-year period the consumption of beef and lamb fell dramatically to approximately 100 grams and 55 grams repectively ."	S_M0
"the consumption of fish also declined,but much less significantly to just below 50 grams,so although it remained the least popular food,consumption levels were the most stable."	S_S2
"the consumption of chicken,on the other hand,showed an upward trend,overtaking taht of lamb in 1980 and taht of beef in 1989."	S_M0

"Nowadays, many people learn foreign languages."	B_I0
"Some people say that learning foreign languages is just to communicate with foreigners when traveling abroad, or to work in foreign countries."	E_I0
"But others believe that traveling abroad and working abroad are not the only reasons why people learn foreign languages."	S_T0
"Learning a foreign language is for traveling abroad or for work needs."	S_M1
"Although this is not the whole reason for learning a foreign language, it may be the main reason for learning a foreign language."	B_S0
"For example, many companies export goods abroad or build factories abroad."	I_S0
"This is very common today, so the bosses of these companies need many people who can speak foreign languages."	I_S0
"On the other hand, there are many students who want to study abroad now."	I_S0
"If they want to study abroad, they must learn the language of another country, so these students will study foreign languages in order to study abroad."	I_S0
"Of course, there are some people who want to better enjoy traveling abroad, so they learn foreign languages, so that they can communicate with local people and enjoy the culture of another country."	I_S0
"So I think these are the main reasons why many people learn foreign languages."	E_S0
"Of course, learning foreign languages is not necessarily just for traveling abroad, studying abroad and work."	S_M1
"It may be other reasons."	B_S0
"For example, the parents are from different countries."	I_S0

"It is quite common these days for people enthusiastically talk about happiness."	S_I0
"The aim of this essay is to outline two reasons why it is difficult to define happiness in a sense ,and put forward some significant factors in achieving happiness."	O
"One of the reasons is that since everyone lives in different surroundings and experiences different things ."	S_M1
"Consequently,the values formed is actually various,so the insights of happiness  vary with each individual."	B_S0
"For example,1000 dollars would be seen as a huge good luck bring happiness for those are not well off,while for the wealthy who usually spend 30000 dollars every months, 100 dollars is just nothing to speak of."	I_S0
"What is more,as an invisible thing,as a kind of emotion,happiness is complicated,which is not only associated with psychology,but also with physiology."	E_S0
"As we mentioned above,for the necessary factors in reaching happiness,we should consider from 2 angels."	S_M1
"First of all,it is apparently acknowledged that healthy body is second to none for happiness."	B_S0

"For instance,a positive student who get 98 in exam,he would be delighted and keep working hard."	I_S0
"By contrast,a negative one getting the same score maybe feel depressed for not getting full marks and complain about everything."	I_S0
"It is obviously the later might be far away from happiness."	E_S0
 
"With the masses' increasing affluence and the development of technological gadgets, people can have multiple access to any events no matter where they happen."	B_I0
"Currently, a controversial topic has aroused heated debate: whether young people today are more likely to invest their time and efforts in improving the world than young people in the past."	I_I0
"Opinions vary from people to people."	I_I0
"Some claims that young people devote less time and efforts in improving our world since most of them now are living overwhelmingly hectic and hurried lifestyles, leaving no time for them to concern about our world."	E_I0
"However, I hold an opposite view that young people are now investing more time and efforts in improving our world than young people in the past."	S_T0
"First off, the appearance of state-of-the-art technological gadgets and devices make modern young people have more approach to know the urgent things happing arould the world."	S_M1
"To illustrate, thanks of the convience of the advanced technology, such as cell phone, cemara, desktop and laptop, young people can attain the first-hand news immediately, as long as there are some people reporting on the websites, compared with young people in the past."	B_S0
"Then they can spare no effort on improving the world."	I_S0
"For instance, China witnessed a destructive earthquake in 2008, which deprived the life of millions people and  tolled down thousands of house."	I_S0
"After the news reported on the World Assistance Commitee, the wordwide people from different counries, culture and color have denoted all kinds of substance to help refugees to get rid of the demage as soon as possible."	I_S0
"In contrast, the congestion of information in the past make it difficult to make great difference on time."	E_S0
"Additionally, the gradually increasing awareness of working together to improving our common world triggers more people to deveto themselves to make our earth better."	S_M1
"To elaborate, it is common that modern people has realized the importance of cooperation, since only after each individual has indulged in some events can we adress the thorny global problems, such as global warming, proverty, environmental protection."	B_S0
"In this case, more and more people will devote their time and energy to improving our world."	I_S0
"For example, the environment has been constantly deteriorated, which is caused by the fumes emited by vehicle, forest exploitation, and water pollutant and so on."	I_S0
"All of these problem alarmed the young people that it is imperative to take some actions to prevent them."	I_S0
"More and more young people sacrifice their time, energy and appealing salary to clean and recycle the pollutant in the oncean, serve as volunteer to reconstruct the habitats for wild animals and work on the renewable and clean power to substitue the pastroline and natural gas."	E_S0

"I guess this view are always shown in school：one person watch another student's homework and remember the answer, then quickly fill in his own paper and hand in the book to their teacher."	B_I0
"This is not  uncommon in nowadays school, more and mroe students are likely to spend a litte time asking other students for answer and spend the rest of the time which should be used in doing their homeworks playing other things, so the topic gives us three ways in order to stop this kind of  cheating activity, and in my opinion, I think the third way is the best way to prevent these activities."	E_I0
"Here are my reason."	S_T1
"First, even the school increase the penalty or punishment to the students who cheat on homework assighment, the students will just ignore it and keep on cheating, because they are more willing to use the time in playing, not in studying, though they have to pay for it."	S_M1
"For example, in 18th th US publish a law called the 'drinking prohibition ‘， however，after ten years there are more bars in the countryside, and the crime statistics keeping increasing  becaause people can't control their desiring of drinking, so they do the drinking bussinesses underground, more and more bars were increasing, and more and more violance because of the resources competition."	B_S1
"So, the same reason, this opinion won't stop the homework cheating."	E_S1
"Second, asking parents  to help monitor their children is also won't working out."	S_M1
"Because, even if parents  can make sure that their children cannot cheating on their homework, for some parents that have a very hard work on the day, and they need to relax themselves in the nigh"	S_S2
 
"As to the modern society, people have more chance to express their own opinion on social or political fairs than before."	S_T0
"According to a recent survey done by the internet questionnaire, seventy percent of people show their intention to express their own idea of things respond to the society."	S_T1
"However, is it really suitable for teachers to express their political idea in the classroom?"	S_I0
"I definitely disagree with the statement."	S_T0
"To begin with, as a student, we are supposed to explore the academic area, acquiring knowledge all over the world."	S_M1
"However, sometimes students can not tell right from wrong, or maybe they lack the critical thinking on a certain thing."	B_S0
"For example, in my primary school, once there were people propagandaing their political view near the school gate, some of teachers took this affair as an example in the social class."	I_S0
"Though he just expressed his opinion for a very while, some of the students were interested in the topic and in favor of the event."	I_S0
"Unluckily, in my contary, supporting such team may break the law since they were not permitted in some of the province."	I_S0
"In this event, none of the students doubted what the teacher said was worth thinking twice, actually they took it for granted."	E_S0
"What's more, division between every individual may cause bad behaviour such as fight or attack."	S_M1
"While the students are supposed to do things related to their study, such event may distract their attention of study which is harmful to their future."	B_S1
"Since the attempt in dealing with the accuracy of such affair is time-consuming and the believes are difficult to change, it is pivotal of teacher to make correct decision."	E_S1
"As all these things been talked above, I y"	S_S2
 
"The graph shows energy consumption in the US from 1980 to 2012, and projected consumption to 2030."	B_I0
"Petrol and oil are the dominant fuel sources throughout this period, with 35 quadrillion units used in 1980，rising to 42q in 2012."	I_I0
"Despite some initial fluctuation, from 1995 there was a steady increase."	E_I0
"This is expected to continue, reaching 47 in 2030."	S_T1
"From 20q and 15q respectively in 1980，gas showed an initial fall and coal a gradual increase，with the two fuels equal between 1985 and 1990."	S_M1
"Consumption has fluctuated since 1990 but both now provide 24q."	B_S1
"Coal is predicted to increase steadily to 31 in 2030, whereas after 2014, gas will remain stable at 25."	E_S1
"In 1980, energy from nuclear, hydro- and solar/wind power was equal at only 4."	S_M1
"Nuclear has risen by 3, and solar/wind by 2."	B_S0
"After slight increases, hydropower has fallen back to the 1980 figure."	I_S0
"It is expected to maintain this level until 2030, while the others should rise slightly after 2025."	E_S0
 
"What should we do when somebody said something wrong in a meeting?"	B_I0
"Should we correct them or should we let it go?"	I_I0
"If we want to correct the mistake the person said, when should we correct the mistake?"	E_I0
"In my opinion, I will choose to correct their mistake after the person who made the mistake have done the speech."	S_T0
"By doing this, the people who made the mistake will realize their problem and correct this mistake in the future, also this person will feel a sense of respect since we did not poinrt out their problem infront of others which will causes the person to feel bad."	S_T1
"Firstly, if we pint out the mistake the person made after all others are gone, they will feel that we have the respect toward them."	S_M1
"Interrupting others is very rude, and since the person who is speaking is our leader or teacher, so we need to respect them ."	B_S0
"For example, once when I was taking a math class last years when I was a high school student in America, my teacher made a mistake when calculating a formation and i realized that."	I_S0
"I told him the mistake after everybody else were gone and he was really appreciated and he corrected this mistake in the next class."	I_S0
"After that, he always decribed me as respectful and smart."	I_S0
"So, people should point out the mistake a teacher or a leader made privately to let them both realize the mistake and feel a sense of respect."	E_S0
"Furthermore, interrupting the teacher or the leader to tell they were wrong or just leave the mistake like this are not good choices."	S_M1
"By interrupting them, they will feel we are intend to embaress them or we do not have a respect to them but if we do not point out their mistake, they might be continous to make the mistake and they will mislead many people."	B_S0
"For example, my friend in a Chinese class last year pointed out a mistake made by their teacher during class by interrupting their teacher, after that, his teacher kept treated he really bad, when he was in high school, there another teacher in his class made a mistake and he just left the mistake like that, later on his teacher was kept making the smae mistake over and over agian."	I_S0
"Therefore, we  better not not either interrupt to point out the mistake or say nothing."	E_S0
 
"Everyone often says that parents are the first teachers of their children."	B_I0
"Children's childhood is to watch their parents grow up, and their words and deeds, to a certain extent, do have an impact on their children's growth path."	E_I0
"Some even think that not only the family has an impact on children's life, but also the external family has a greater impact on children's development."	S_T0
"From my point of view, I think the impact of external family on children's development is really a little larger."	S_M1
"In life, parents are always careful to take care of their children, dare not appear a little problem."	B_S0
"In life, we always deal with everything well and set a good example for our children."	I_S0
"And when tutoring children's homework, they can always teach them carefully."	I_S0
"But in life, we can only teach children how to tidy up their own lives, how to arrange their own lives."	I_S0
"Children cannot use skills learned at home in a social environment."	I_S0
"For example, the traffic rules can't be experienced by the children at home."	I_S0
"If the parents do well in life, but they run the red light with the children outside the family, which violates the traffic rules, it is bound to have a huge impact on the growth and development of the children."	E_S0
"In terms of the disposal of domestic garbage, parents at home must carefully educate their children to keep their homes and rooms clean and tidy at all times."	S_M1
"Garbage must be thrown into the trash can, but children don't know how to change when they are young."	B_S1
"When children go out, whether they have the habit of throwing garbage into the roadside trash can depends on our parents taking their children out at ordinary times How to educate children will have a great impact on their growth and development."	E_S1
"So the education in life is important, but the education outside the family is also very important, it is an indispensable part, it will have a huge impact on the growth and future of children."	S_C2
 
"The diagram illustrates the program of a hydroelectric power station which generates the electricity."	S_I0
"Firstly, water flows from river to a reservoir which called high-level reservoir and below the dam,there is a intake which is opened in the daytime and closed at night."	S_M1
"Secondly,in the daytime,water flows to generate electricity to the power station and flow to the low-level reservoir."	B_S0
"The flow of water can generate power and it can be sent to the generator."	I_S0
"In addition,after the generator,there are power lines which send the power to the national grid."	I_S0
"At night,water from a reservoir which called low-level reservoir would be sent in turn and though power station, water would be pumped across the intake to the high-level reservoir."	E_S0
"Overall, the program of a hydroelectric power station shows a cycle of water from river."	S_M1
"The final product is electricity which is generated by flow of water and it is sent to the national grid in the end."	S_S2
 
"It is true that new technologies have had an influence on communication between people."	S_I0

"It is convenient for businessmen to communicate and trade on the Internet."	B_S0
"For those who go to work, it is convenient to work on the Internet."	I_S0
"For us students, we can study online, if it is not convenient to study at school, we can study at home, we can also learn knowledge"	E_S0
"On the one hand, these developments can be extremely positive."	S_M1
"Cooperation between people in different countries was much more difficult when communication was limited to written letters or telegrams."	B_S0
"Nowadays, interactions by email, phone or video are almost as good as face-to-face meetings, and many of us benefit from these interactions, either in work or social contexts."	I_S0
"On the other hand, the availability of new communication technologies can also have the result of isolating people and discouraging real interaction."	I_S0
"For example, many young people only live in the virtual world and do not communicate with others, which leads to communication barriers between people and makes the relationship indifferent."	E_S0
"However, I believe that such problems can be solved if people make more efforts."	B_C1
"In a word, as the development of technology makes the relationship between people more intimate, convenient and colorful, I believe that this development has more positive impact on people than negative impact."	E_C1
 
"Given the first chart is about the population of Japanese tourists who traveled abroad between the years of 1986 and 1995."	B_T1

"The population rises from approximately 5 million in 1985 to nearly 16 million in 1995."	S_S2
"As for the second graph, it is witnessed a rocket increase of Australia's share of Japan's tourist market."	S_M1
"The percentage of those tourists took up 2% in 1985 and peaked at just above 6% in 1993."	B_S1

"I don't agree with this opinion."	B_T0
"I think sports and music are as important as academic subjects are."	I_T0
"Firstly, academic subjects are more important for future jobs, it dones'n means sports and music completely not important for future job."	I_T0
"No one can predict exactly what job they will have, so it is possible for everyone to do a job that relative to sports or music."	I_T0
"Even if someone truly know what his or her future job, sports and music can be a skill or an interests or hobbies."	I_T0
"From my own experience."	E_T0
"I'm used to be a person who don't like learnd new skills and who don't take sports and music class so seriously, but my mom told me that skills are not burden, so gratually I start to leand those classes serious."	B_S0
"On the junior high school, I found that the sport result counts into the high school examination result."	I_S0
"Primary school to maintain a healthy body, so that my junior high school sports performance is very good."	I_S0
"So from my experience, it's not hard to see that you can't know some where or some time you can use these skills."	E_S0
"Secondly, if schools don't emphasize sports and music, will the student and parents agree?"	S_M2
"First, sport."	B_S0
"This class is the only chance for student to do some activities."	I_S0
"if school don't pay much attention to this cource, what about students health."	I_S0
"If they don't have a healthy body, how can they study."	I_S0
"Second, music."	I_S0
"This is not so much a course as a lesson in commom sense."	I_S0
"It is also very important."	E_S0
"Finally, The state now advocates multifaceted development, if just emphasize academic subjects which are more important for furture jobs, what about multi-directional development and iner-disciplinary talent?"	B_C1
"To sum of in conclusion, I don't agree with 'school emphasize academic subjects, which are more important for future jobs, rather tha sports and music.'  this opinion."	E_C1
 
"As we all know that with the development with technology that the number of TV channels is increasing rapidly."	S_T1
"It means that people can have more choices when they are wathcing TV but there is no dennying that the quality of TV programs's quality is decreasing."	B_S0
"Should we have lots of TV channels with low quality of programs  or shoud we have less TV channels but with high quality of programs?"	I_S0
"Firstly,more TV channels can let us switch lots of channels and
find one of our favourites but there is a problem."	I_S0
"because the quality of TV programs is not high so i have to switch back and forth trying to find one i like,it takes us lots of time."	I_S0
"For instance,when we want to watch a movie we want like  an action movie but after we swtiched channels for ten minutes，we only find movies about love or murder and this causes lots of time and makes us be depressed."	I_S0
"Secondly,less TV channals with amazing programs can always enjoy people and improve their watching quality but when these channals are getting more and more popular,they will begin to seek
for advertising sponsorship to get more money."	I_S0
"For example,when we are watching a fantastic talk show and it is getting to the most exciting part, it suddenly stops and play several long advertisings and make us be annoyed."	I_S0
"This is really frustrating."	I_S0
"In my opinion,comparing amount of TV channals with programs that are not very high with waiting for eternal advertisings，i would rather choose switching back and forth,i still remember my friend's
saying,'choose,or to be chosen.'"	I_S0
"Instead of waiting i would choose the freedom of my life."	E_S0
 
"I am totally agree with the statement."	B_T0
"I believe that in the past, young people were relying too much on their parents for decisions making, and today youth are becoming to make their lives decision on their own."	I_T0
"The key reason lies in that today almost everyone in this world have a chance to receive education which might be not practical before."	E_T0
"As our countries developed, more and more school are being able to be built, as a result, outstanding scholars and teachers come to our lives and give more people better education."	S_M1
"Once we receive education, plenty of chances and experiments are exposed to us, which people in the past can not imagine, and we have the opportunites to know all kinds of jobs existed in this world by ourselves, but not through our parents."	B_S0
"All of us have unique talent, and it is our responsibilties to discover what that is,  and it is education that helps us discover."	I_S0
"Maybe we could be a great scientists, maybe even good enough to come up with the cure for COVID-19, but we need to take that science class to find out by ourselves."	E_S0
"Besides, we are facing more chances and more jobs and we get to know our interests through TV, newspapers or others' teaching."	S_M1
"We can be athletes, politicians and teachers, etc."	B_S1
"More jobs are being respected and valued so that our parents are less likely than before to force us to do what they might find good for us."	I_S1
"Finally, I think the moment when one man is truly holding freedom in his own hands is that he or she precisely know how things work and how they are going to be responsible for it and also themselves."	I_S1
"The modern world gifted us with the accessible knowledge of the whole world much more than before, and now since that we know how things work in this world, we are better able to make decisions about our lives."	E_S1
 
"The presented diagrams illustrate the changes the West Park Secondary School has undergone since its establishment in 1950."	S_I0
"Overall, it is evident that the school area was expanded and the areas for the playground and sports field contracted."	S_T1
"As can be seen from the diagrams, the first time different modifications were made to the school ground was in 1980, when a new car park and science block were constructed where a group of residential houses used to be."	S_M1
"The nearby farmland was also converted into a sports field."	S_S2
"In 2010, the most significant alteration to the school territory was the enlargement of the parking spot, which then covered the entire old sports field."	S_M1
"In addition, the size of the playground had been reduced to make room for a new sports field."	B_S2
"To summarise, over the years West Park Secondary School has built and expanded some new facilities, such as the car park and science block, but at the same time, its playground and sports field have been reduced in size."	E_S2
 
"The chart shows the changes in unemployment rates in the US and Japan from 1993 to 1999."	S_I0
"Obviously, the trend in unemployment in the US and Japan is in complete reverse."	S_T1
"In March 1993, the unemployment rate in the US was at its highest, at about 7%, while in Japan it was at its lowest, at 2.5%."	B_S0
"Then the unemploment rate in Japan begsn to rise year after year, and the unemploment rate in theUS began to fall year after year."	I_S0
"In 1998 to 1999, unemployment in both countries was roughly the same."	E_S0
"According to the chart, the unemployment rate in theUS fell by 2%over the six years, while in  Japan it rose by 2.5%, eventually stabilizing at 5% in 1999."	S_S2
 
"I agree with the statement that teachers should not make their social or political views known to students in the classroom."	S_T0
"It's firstly about the job of a teacher."	S_M0
"It is widely known that the main job of a teacher is to lead the student to discover the world of the new knowleges."	B_S0
"Constructing a pure academic environment for stduents is of great significance, as students are coming to school for understanding the world and universe, but not just politics or the society."	I_S0
"For the students of low ages, it is even more necessary that the teacher should keep himself not to spread the social or political views."	E_S0
"If some students has totaly different opinion towards the society and politics, they may have conflicts with the teacher."	S_M0
"And this will have an unexpected impact on the whole teaching and learning process."	B_S0
"The relationship between students and teachers my be worsen."	I_S0
"This is not good for the development of the students and teachers."	E_S0
"Also, every student has the right to form his own social or political views during the growth."	S_M0
"Teachers have the responsibility to show the direction for students to let them think individualy, optimistically and objectively, but not trying to interupt the whole growing period by alloying his personal understanding."	B_S1
"The variety of the students' views can prove the teacher's skill of sharing knowleges and teaching students how to be a individual person."	E_S1
"As a result, teachers should be a guide for the students, and give the enough space to students to form their own horizons."	S_C2
 
"There is a body of opinion which state that the proposal made by celebrities or famous people are more influential to youngsters than to the older generation."	B_T0
"I personally disagree with this idea."	E_T0
"Admittedly, young children are typically more into famous people than older people because they have less concerns in their lifes."	S_M1
"High schools students, for example, work only for their academic performance in the exams, as their parents bear all the pressure and responsibility of earning a living or buying houses."	B_S0
"As such, they have plenty of time left for watching movies and listening to trendy music which strengthen their bonds with the celebrities they like."	I_S0
"This certainly is something theri older counterpart does not have."	E_S0
"I, however, think idols or celebrities have an equal infulence on older or younger fans, since it depends on how much a person feel emotionally attached to the them."	S_M1
"My friend who was in China feels related with a famous band he liked which named the Mayday."	B_S0
"He went to every concert they held and also formed a fan group for their idols."	I_S0
"All the activities he took made his life meaningful and worth living which is something his parents would find challenging to encourage."	I_S0
"So to be emotionally attachedd with one's idol peopbably does not related to the age of the fans."	I_S0
"Furthermore, older people are more likely to build emotional attachment with the idols they like because they just live loger than the younger generation and has a longer history about liking their idols."	I_S0
"When people like a person long enough, the emotion would gradually level up into something more intense like love."	E_S0
"This love can help"	O
 
"I still remmenber that when I was a child, my parent always let me do the things by byself which I can do on my own."	S_I0
"They encouraged me to just go can did not to afraid of the mistake I may make."	S_T1
"At that time, I did not think much and do what they let, just with a feeling of free and happy."	B_S0
"It was not Until now when I grow up and live life in the society did I learn that the reason why they let me make miatakes istead of teching me before is that they wanted me to learn from these mistakes by my own."	I_S0
"How I am grateful for them and their behavors, for their forward-thinking and witness."	E_S0
"Therefore, I would agree that parent should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes."	S_M1
"For one thing, parents could not be companion with their children all the time."	B_S0
"They could not avoid children doing soemthing on theri own and thus, could not avoid the mistakes children made."	I_S0
"Secondly, at anytime children want to do something new, if parents do not want chilldren meet any mistakes by teaching them before, children would only solve the problem as follows."	I_S0
"They lose the chance to think and imagine and will not enjoy the effort of trying to overcome the difficult."	I_S0
"Only when they do the things all by themselves could them learn more and grow up to be mature."	I_S0
"Last but not least, it would be more impressive for children by making mistakes and learning from their own mistakes."	I_S0
"In this occasion, they would not make such mistakes anymore, as they have made, tried and learned."	E_S0
"Nowadays, there are still many parents afraid of their children meeting any difficulty and devoting themselves to pretecting children form any mistakes."	S_M1
"In my opinion, when chileren make mistakes and would learn from these, they would normally learn better and do better in the future."	B_S0
"So just let them go, encourage them to bravely do."	I_S0
"What most important is to tell them to learn."	E_S0
 
"There are a lot of way for teachers to teaching in order to make the students more fulfilling and high-knowledged."	B_I0
"Some tasks made by teachers are aimed at group working while others are asked to be finished by students themselves."	E_I0
"There is an argument that working together is more effectively than working alone, and as for me, I agree with that."	S_T0
"Admittedly, working independently offers students the chance to learn to think things out for themselves and matchs more on the exams in schools."	S_M0
"But students will be not concentrating on their work if there are something more interesting, and also they will not have the competitive consiousness as they have no idea about other students processes of accomplishment."	S_S2
"To begin with, group works offers a chance for students to gain some experience and skills from others and solve their problems in time."	S_M0
"Group members are all individuals."	B_S0
"they have different ideas or perspective even on the same thing and thus finish the task more quickly."	I_S0
"Take myself for example, last year when I had a group assignment with my classmates, I really benefited a lot from that."	I_S0
"After the discusion, we searched for some essays and information and then shared together."	I_S0
"It saved me a lot of time because I could gain some ideas from others."	I_S0
"I still remember that I was got into a huge trouble when I did my part of the project, luckily, they helped me to figure out the question and solve it."	I_S0
"I could not imagine that if I can finish the task on time without them."	E_S0
"Furthermore, others can be a motivation and inspiration for students if they feel tired in their work or study."	S_M0
"Since there are not anyone here to supervise if students working alone and they will be tired and even give up in the half way."	B_S0
"A survey made by the National Educational Commitee did a investigation among students last year, they assigned the same tasks for each student but some were asked to work together while some were alone."	I_S0
"Then the researchers did some interfere to them such as broadcasted some music or talk around when students were learning."	I_S0
"The results showed that students in groups would be interfered by the environment less than the students worked alone."	I_S0
"Probably due to the reason that other members in the group will do some vital catalytic roles on others."	E_S0
"To sum up, students do work more effectively in groups rather than work alone."	B_C1
"Not only because of the information or ideas  they are willing to get, but also due to their concentrations in study."	E_C1
 
"I support the idea that the government should make laws to rule peoples actions."	B_T1
"Everyone has their own opinion and it is difficult to combine them into a same one."	I_T1
"But that is why laws were created,everyone is equal and everyone should obey the rules."	E_T1
"In many countries for example japan."	B_S0
"They have laws in recycling the waste and that is why the environment in japan is better than the other countries."	I_S0
"And also Shanghai,China annouced the laws last year and it do work,it make the recycle more efficient and convenient."	I_S0
"Other countries in China are encouraged to follow the actions that Shanghai goverment did."	E_S0
"If we do not make laws to rule people i think it is difficult to let people do things that you want but is not convenient for them even though it can improve our lives."	S_C2
"So my opinion is goverment should make laws and make it a legal requirment."	S_S2
 
"The table presents the quantities of persons to Ashdown Museum and the pie charts illustrate the Ashdown Museumconditions for Ashdown Museum between the year before and the year after it was rebuilt."	S_I0
"During the period before refurbishment, there were about 74,000 vistiors to  Ashdown Museum, while after refurbishment, the nunber of the visitors were 92, 000, which was increased 18,000 persons."	S_M2
"With the refurbishment, the satisfication of visitors had been changed."	B_S0
"Before refurbishment, Dissatisfication was the outstanding part, accounted for 40%, followed by satisfication(30%), which decreased to 15% and increased to 40% respectively after refurbishment."	I_S0
"The very satisfication between the after and before increased more than two times."	I_S0
"The very dissatisfication decreased from 10% to 5%."	I_S0
"The number of no response kept stable, at 5%."	E_S0
"All in all, after refurbishment, the number of visitors to Ashdown Museum is increasing, at the same time, the satisfication of the visitors also is increasing."	S_C2
 
"The pie gragh graph describes the various causes of land degradation all over the world while the second table graph depicts illustrates to what extent the four causes affect three regions of world respectively."	O
"According to the pie chart, it the reason has been divided into four different parts as deforestation, over-cultivation, over-gazing and other."	S_M1
"Obviously, over-grazing had the largest proportion which occupied of 35%, while other reasons had the smallest percentage, which took up 7% during 1990s."	B_S1
"More specifically, after over-gazing, deforestation filled the second place with 30% which was followed by over-cultivation,
representing 28%."	E_S1
"As is shown in second table, in North America, 0.2% of land was degraded by deforestation, and3.3% was degraded by over-gazing."	S_M1
"It was manifest that over-cultivation was the main culprit."	B_S0
"By contrast, over-cultivation had no influence in the degradation of Oceania."	I_S0
"While deforestation left 1.7% land less productive and over-gazing 11.3%."	I_S0
"Therefore overgrazing was the leading factor."	I_S0
"Next in Europe 9.8% land, the largest area was degraded by deforestation whilst 7.7% and 5.5% land degradation was caused by over-cultivation and over-grazing respectively."	E_S0
"It also can be seen clearly from the table that the total land degradation in North America, Europe, Oceania was 5%, 23%, and 13%."	S_C2
"Overall, Europe was affected by these causes seriously and the main causes were deforestation and over-cultivation."	S_S2
 
"People have been learned foreign languages for many different reasons; however, these days, some people believed that individuals learn one or several languages in order to only travel abroad or work for a multinational company."	S_I0
"In my opinion, it is a misconception to indicate only the two reasons since there are many purposes in learning foreign languages."	S_T0
"Nowadays, the number of students who either intended to or already study in overseas increases significantly every year."	S_M1
"Thus, these students have to be able to speak a language of a host country, generally English, in order to study abroad."	B_S1
"Moreover, researchers are usually required to write their papers in English,which forces them to master a certain language,English."	E_S1
"On the other hand, it is true that a substantial number of people learn foreign languages to travel abroad or to work for a foreign organisation since the world became more globalised than before."	S_M1
"Individuals take a foreign language course in order to be employed in a overseas-funded enterprise for better job opportunities."	B_S1
"While people who want to visit overseas countries have to learn a local language of an intended country in order to reduce the burden of language obstacles."	E_S1
"In conclusion, it is true that most people learn foreign languages in order to travel or to work; nonetheless, those are not only reasons for learning a foreign language since individuals have other reasons such as studying and doing research."	S_C2
 
"Nowadays, more and more people are concerned about the harm of eating fast food,such as obesity."	B_I0
"Experts have suggested ways to limit the growth of the fast-food industry, including raising tariffs."	E_I0
"In my opinion, higher taxes can partly solve the problem that fast food bring to us."	S_T0
"A big tariff increase could raise the price of fast food because of the rising cost of running a restaurant."	S_M0
"In some circumstances, it is the lower prices compared with healthy diets that prompts poor people choose to eat fast food."	B_S1
"If the expenditure on fast food is slightly higher or  equal to healthy eating, more people will switch to enjoy healthy food."	E_S1
"Tax increases from the fast-food industry could be used to strengthen health care or expand the number of fitness devices."	S_M0
"As a result, people with health problems can get better treatment or use these facilities for more exercise."	B_S1
"Healthy food combined with high-quality medical care and fitness will make people more and more energetic."	E_S1
"We cannot deny that higher tariffs will not only bring us benefits, but may also cause social problems, such as increased unemployment."	S_M0
"Despite the fact that  as the competitiveness declines, the managers of fast food restaurants will have to cut down the amount of employees, and even close the restaurants,which will bring instability to the society,we can still solve this problem by developing new industries to accept these labor force such as logistics ."	S_S2
"In a word, I agree with the policy of raising the tariff on fast food."	B_C1
"Higher taxes could curb the boom in the fast food industry and, to some extent, encourage people to eat healthier food."	E_C1
 
"The table and charts decipt the numbers of tourists and the degree of visitor satisfaction during the year before and the year after of Ashdown Museum."	S_I0
"Before the year of refurbishment, there were 74 thousands people who visited this museum."	S_M1
"According to the first chart,the largest percent of people was dissatisfied(40%),and the proportion of satisfied was 30%."	B_S1
"The rest of visitors were very satisfied(15%),very dissatisfied(10%) and no respone(5%)."	E_S1
"However,there were 92 thousands tourists after the year of refurbishment."	S_M1
"Based on the second chart,it could be seen that the visitor satisfication had a transformation."	B_S0
"The largest number of people was satisfied for the museum(40%)."	I_S0
"The very satisfied trouists(35%) also occupied a big  percentage."	I_S0
"It could be seen that the dissatisfied people made up 15% of total people who did the surveys."	I_S0
"The same proportion were very dissatisfied and no response people that accounted for 5%."	E_S0
"In summary,it could be seen that most visitors were dissatisfied for the museum before refurbishment."	S_C2
"But after refurbishment,there were most people satisfied."	S_S2
 
"Nowadays, people are highly exposed to the celebrities’ world—live entertainment news, celebrity interviews and celebrities’ reality show."	B_T1
"The question comes, “who are influenced more by the opinions of celebrities?”"	E_T1
"As far as I am concerned, celebrities’ opinions are of more importance to older people."	B_S0
"First of all, young people are able to access various information--from internet, peers or journals and the like--and celebrity is just one of the sources."	I_S0
"However, older people’s information source are usually limited to TV news or programs, during which the presence of celebrity is quite often."	I_S0
"So, older people are exposed more to the opinions of celebrities."	I_S0
"For example, older people in my family--my parents, my aunts and uncles—are big fans of a TV program called “Old Uncle”."	I_S0
"The host of this program is Bai Wanqing, a famous mediator."	I_S0
"Her statements in the program are always highly valued by my parents, while I treat her opinions indifferently."	I_S0
"In such cases, older people are influenced more by the opinions of celebrities."	I_S0
"Moreover, young people are usually better educated than older people and most of them receive higher education."	I_S0
"As a result, they are more likely to make wiser judgment based on their profound knowledge and experience."	I_S0
"So, opinions of celebrities tend to have less influence on them."	I_S0
"For example, it is quite often that many female celebrities like to recommend cosmetics they prefer."	I_S0
"Although their recommendation seems to be so convincing, I will not blindly take these suggestions."	I_S0
"Instead, I would do some research online to see whether the products recommended are truly good."	I_S0
"Obviously, young people are less affected."	I_S0
"Admittedly, young people are more willing to spend a great amount of money on celebrity-related products or works."	I_S0
"For example, one of my friends Su Hong would attend every concert of Jay Zhou; she would purchase all the music album of him."	I_S0
"However, it doesn’t mean young people would take celebrities’ opinions more seriously."	I_S0
"In a nutshell, I still hold the idea that opinions of celebrities are of less importance to younger people."	E_S0
 
"In recent years, mang students have this phenomenon that they unlike studying after graduating."	S_T0
"I think this is a terrible thing, and i believe that the lure from coloful socity, the tired hurt to studying,and busy work time which cause the problem."	S_T1
"I believe that the primary factor is that the lure from coloful socity."	B_S0
"Follow the technology has a great devolepment, a various of intersting things show up to everyone`s eyes, which will cause students to paying attention to these."	I_S0
"The students will find that studying is so boring thing that they do not what to continue after graduating."	I_S0
"On  other hand, the students have studied many years which cause that they are so tired."	I_S0
"When they continue studying after graduating, they will feel so boring and tired that they can not fouce on studying."	I_S0
"The last reason is that the busy work time lead to the phenomenon."	I_S0
"When  student have graduated, the frist thing is finding a job."	I_S0
"And the job will cost much time which result student do not have time and tired to study."	I_S0
"However, I believe we also have way to change or deal with the situation."	I_S0
"The people can come up with some good game about studying,which can help the student to continue studying."	I_S0
"And this kind of game can bring the funning to people."	I_S0
"In sum up, the phenomenon that young students detest sthdying after graduating is a terrible thing."	I_S0
"So we should have the idea about that we should not stop studying in life, which can help us to get a wonderful future."	E_S0
 
"The pie charts illustrate units of electricity production by fuel source in Australia and Fiance between 1980 and 2000."	S_I0

"For Australia , coal became the main electric fuel source, the percentage of oil and natur gas plummet even vanish."	S_M1
"The units of electricity by coal surge from 50 in 1980 to130 in 2000."	B_S0
"This was the most striking change."	I_S0
"Since 1980, people decreased used oil and natur gas as electric fuel source, both droped from 10 units and 20 units to 2 units until 2000."	I_S0
"However, A rise can be found in the number of hydro power as electric fuel source frome 20 units to 36 units."	E_S0
"For France, nuclear power became the main electric fuel source, while the use level of natur gas and hydro power fell rapidly."	S_M1
"A period from 1980 and 2000 saw a rise in the units of nuclear power from 25 units to 126 units."	S_S2
"Overall, it is clear that by 20000 these two countries relied on different principal fuel sources: Australia relied on coal and France on nuclear power."	S_C2
 
"Lately debates have raged over whether many people choose to become a self-employed or work for a company."	B_T1
"For the most part ,the former should be considered justified."	E_T1
"One of the most convincing arguments  is that people choose to be a self-employed means they can do any work they love."	B_S0
"today ,there are tens of thousands of workers in the world,but most of them are not like their work, the work is just a means of making aliving,instead of working hard becaus love."	I_S0
"Over time ,people will become numb and life will become boring,finally lose the meaning of life ."	E_S0

"Adversely,the figure of Middle East has always located at the bottom(9.8 million in1990,15.8million in 2005),it was less than which of Africa all the time,the second-least one among these five regions."	S_S2

"I insisted in watching TV day and night, my eyes hadn't been relaxed until I went to bed."	I_S0

"Many kinds of TV channels which include education;technoledge and so on can give many informations for us."	I_S0

"For me the two point have there own reason."	I_S0
"So that i think there twe view may be all right."	I_S0

"From my perspective, both of them are of great significance in people's daily life."	B_S0
"There is no doubt that the railway construction is beneficial for us due to the fact that it brings us a great deal of convenience."	I_S0
"Firstly,taking the train can help us save time when we expect to travel or take a business trip to another city."	I_S0
"The reason for this fact may involve the recognition that the speed of train is obviously faster than that of private cars or some other vehicles running on the road."	I_S0
"What is more important is that there seems to be not a traffic congestion if we go out by train."	I_S0
"Secondly, compared with trucks, trains can transport much more overweight goods with large volume, which may provide the enterprises located in the different areas with more opportunities to cooperate with each other."	I_S0

"In addition, the cost of road construction is comparatively lower than that of railway construction, the result of which is that the fiscal burden imposed on the local governments will be relieved to some extent."	I_S0
"Consequently, governments are able to pour more money into the improvement of other public services such as medical health and education system."	I_S0
"All in all, it is my belief that governments are supposed to take the responsibility of constructing railways as well as roads."	E_S0

"The earlier the age,the stronger the learning ability,so the faster the children to accept a foreign language."	B_S0
"Just like we are learning our mother tongue,although there is no systematic contact with it before going to school,the usage has reached a certain level even has become a habit."	I_S0

"In this era, society is functioning in a crazy speed, meaning that people-even toddlers in kintergarden-are always loaded with tasks that are almost impossible to finish."	B_S0

"For instance, companies should form a social network that checks on employees and encouraging each other to do sports together."	I_S0
"For fast food addicts, last but not least, they may search the Internet to join groups to cut this obsession."	E_S0
"To sum up, not having enough time to exercise and eating too many fast foods are the prime reasons."	S_C2

"This is because if a person can speak a foreign language as fluently and beautifully as a native speaker, there may be no difficulty for him to communicate with store owners, waiters and other people he can meet during a vacation."	I_S0
"people  can benefit from learning a foreign language compared with those who do not have the chance to get better language education for the reason that mastering a language is the basic skill for foreigners to live with native speakers."	I_S0
"And if graduates what to be employed by companies in foreign country, they need to speak this language proficiently and have conversations with coworkers smartly over business negotiation as well as cooperation."	E_S0

"I believe people have a command of a language not only for its function ,but also for learning a different culture which they have not come into contact with before."	B_S0
"This is because learning a foreign language means respect and understanding towards another culture."	I_S0
"For example, someone desires to learn more about the culture and traditions in England, he first needs to have a good command of English, otherwise, he even does not have the ability to read English books or poems by himself."	I_S0

"to begin with, teachers are more familiar with the ability and interest of kids."	S_M0
"In other words, teachers know what level of knowledge they are fixed in so teachers will give them certain exercises to boost their score up."	B_S1
"Under this circumstance, pupils can be improved depending on the teaching methods teachers give and teachers can give some advice on choosing their future career based on their ability."	E_S1
"Moreover, teachers have certain experience and criteria to judge them."	S_M0
"Put ti differently, teachers have taught lots of students and given lots of suggestions, thereby they can evaluate them on social criteria."	B_S1
"On the contrary, if students do not know the reality and the capabilities of opponents, thus they will receive a rejective letter when they apply for a job."	E_S1
"Despite certain circumstances, others think that parents can be good influencers on their intelligence and social developments because of the closest relationship."	S_M0
"Parents bond with their children for their whole life but teachers along with them just for several years, therefore, the family has more time to affect them."	B_S0

"Recently, whether governments should spend money on railways rather than roads is widely disputed by people."	S_T1
"I can't agree that railways should be spent money than the road more."	B_S0
"some people hold the opinions that the number of roads are more enormous than that of railways,which means that governments should pay  for the constructions of the roads."	I_S0
"For example , there is only one line of railway in  a no-center city such as Golmud city ,while more than 10 roads are across the city ."	I_S0
"In that condition, money seems to be reasonable to spend on the roads."	I_S0
"We cannot deny that the number of roads are more than that of railways in most of cities in China."	I_S0
"However, it is the costs instead of numbers that count."	I_S0
"the cost of a road is far less than a railway."	I_S0
"That is because if we wanted to build a railway, plenty of stations are needed to ensure people to board the train ."	I_S0
"Besides, the rails need to be maintained and repaired frequently,which is required a great amount of money  while the  road can be fixed easily and cost far less."	I_S0
"More relating facilities and higher maintenance price lead to more money for governments to pay for functioning the railways."	I_S0
"So governments should spend money on railways rather than roads."	I_S0
"In my opinion, money  need to be spent on the railways for government because with  the development of economy, more and more companies attach more importance to the cons"	E_S0

"There is a growning tendency that citizens learning another languages."	S_T1

"Undeniable, it is great for children to not worry about the lack of basic elements from livelihood, and children can pay more attention on their study so they can get both good grade and comfotable environment."	S_M1
"It may the think of many parents,for who wants to make their children getting good educate."	S_S2
"However, in my opinion, it will get bad influence for kids."	S_M1
"If parents give their much moeny, they will thinking of how to use this money so they may buy  some expensive things, and these things may not nassesary for their life and study."	B_S0
"For these inmature kids, this scene can let them get bad habit such as wasting money, compare with each other and so on."	I_S0

"In today's society, with the progress of human civilization and the development of the legal system, it has been the focus of debate whether the fixed penalty should be established for each type of crime."	B_I0
"Some advocate sentencing for every crime, while others advocate that more similar circumstances and motivations should be taken into account in sentencing."	E_I0
"However, in my opinion, the latter view is more acceptable."	S_T0
"The argument of setting up fixed penalty for different types of crimes is not groundless."	S_M1
"In fact, this approach, if possible, can bring us some benefits, that is, it can improve the efficiency of handling cases."	B_S0
"For example, a case may take several days to become the final judge, and even if there is no judge's professional evaluation, there will be one or two seconds to close the case."	I_S0
"In addition, such an approach may have some deterrent effects on individuals who tend to commit certain crimes, as they may be threatened by predetermined penalties."	E_S0
"However, such arguments may underestimate the importance of other factors, such as the status of the offender and the cause of the crime, which play a key role in prolonging or reducing the penalty as supplementary evidence."	S_M1
"To better understand this, we compared it with nuances: one of the two accused of bank robbery tried to pay his mother's expensive treatment, while the other did so to satisfy his extravagant desires."	B_S0
"In this case, how can we give them the same punishment?"	I_S0
"From this example, we definitely need to consider these important factors when making decisions."	E_S0
"Finally, I believe that although the implementation of a fixed penalty for each type of crime can help improve the efficiency of the court, the professional and comprehensive assessment of complex situations by judges also needs attention."	S_C2
 
"Nowdays we have two different opitions about how to choose TV channel'numbers , some people think more TV channels it's good for us cause we can have more choices."	S_T1

"While other people don't think so , they think too many TV channels has some big problems such like it will lead a lot of poor quality programs ."	I_S0
"Some families have babies or teenagers ,they are in studying and growing ."	I_S0
"So their parents will help them to find   some TV channels and programs that benifit for them , and when sometimes they watch TV and choose channels by themselves ,  poor quality channels will lead some bad infomations for them ."	I_S0

"Perspectives vary from one to another whether aimed to travel or work abroad is the only reason people learning foreign language,in my views,it can never be the only reason why someone should learn a foreign language."	B_I0
"To begin with,there is no doubt that a foreign language is a essential tool to communicate with local people when you travel or work abroad,it would be convenient when you need to look for somewhere or buy something, what's more,language can make it easier to get know of cultural differences,"	E_I0
"Behind this,when it comes to a international trade or any business negotiations,a foreign language can be a unique 'weapon' to negotiate with your commercial partner to make a deal or seize a great number of chances to get over your competitives,a foreign language can make a company  get more international information to find a potential market."

"Nowadays, due to the fast development of modern society, people’s living habits change greatly."	S_I0
"Some people claimed that nowadays, young people can not make better decisions for their future development and young people depended on their parents appropriately in the past."	B_T0
"However, in my opinion, young people are able to make better decisions on their future development while young people in the past relied on their parents too much in making decisions."	E_T0
"Young people today are able to make their decisions more suitable for them through comprehensive information."	S_M1
"The key reason lies in the fact that due to the fast development and popularization of network , young people have multiple ways to find helpful information from the Internet."	B_S0
"In this case, if a young person is interested in one specific aspect, he/she can use Internet searching engines to find various information including videos and articles about this specific aspect."	I_S0
"By comparing different jobs' information, the person could find the job which fits him/her well in his/her favorite aspect."	I_S0
"Therefore, the person makes well decisions."	I_S0
"For example, one boy who favors physics can use Googles’ searching engine to find and get familiar with main academic topics in physics field."	I_S0
"And the boy compares each topic with other topics carefully and finds out that quantum physics fits his interests best."	I_S0
"Thus, he can prepare for quantum physics and choose quantum physics as his major."	I_S0
"On the contrary, young people in the past did not have enough experiences while their parents’ working experiences were much richer than their experiences."	I_S0
"Consequently, young people relied on their parents too much when whey were making their decisions about their future development because they might use their parents' experiences as references."	I_S0
"And their decisions might not fit them well due to their single information source."	E_S0
"Young people make better decisions based on environments in modern society."	S_M1
"One of the crucial factors is that due to the development of technology, it is easy and convenient for people in modern society to travel around the world."	B_S0
"Thus, when young people travel around the world, landscapes around the world expand their horizons."	I_S0
"Their knowledge is enriched during their travels and provides good background for their decisions about their future development."	I_S0
"In this case, young people in modern society make better decisions based on combination of comprehensive knowledge."	I_S0
"In the contrast, it is hard for young people to expand their horizons in the past due to low transportation technology."	I_S0
"As a result, they were lack of enough background information."	I_S0
"And this led to their poor decisions and dependence on their parents' experiences."	E_S0
"It can not be denied that nowadays, young people may absorb some bad information from Internet."	B_C0
"However, due to mature education system in modern society, young people are able to distinguish harmful information, Thus, possible negative influence of harmful information is minimized."	I_C0
"From what has been discussed above, I draw a conclusion that young people in the modern society make better decisions for their future development and young people in the past depended on their parents too much in making decisions."	E_C0
 
"Today some people enhance the loyalty that we should work in one organisation all the working time,while others think it is better to switch the working place."	B_T0
"In my opinion , both of them has their advantages."	E_T0
"The people who want to work for one organisation all the life always have some advantages of stability."	S_M1
"Firstly, working in an organisation for a long time always means more working experience and higher ability,which always counts in the procession of promotion."	B_S0
"So in many cases,loyalty means higher position and more payment,which is attractive in terms of one person."	I_S0
"And in terms of family,the person with a stable job is more likely to have a smooth and stable family,which is of vital importance to the education of the next generation."	E_S0
"While the people who thinks it is better to work for different organisation have some advantages of flexibility."	S_M1
"Many people may think that always working in the same place and doing the same job are boring,and switching jobs leads to more life experience that is both in work-style of  different organisation  and in living conditions in variable places,which is a measure."	B_S0
"In another way,those people is more flexible."	I_S0
"They can chasing the trend of the society and meeting the need of the new field,which is likely get the chance to earn huge amount of money."	E_S0
"In my opinion,we should combine those two views."	S_C2
"We can switch the organisation in our young age  to find which suits us best and stick to that organisation in the rest of our working life."	B_S1
"Under no circumstance should we hang around between different organisations all the working time,because we are more likely achieving nothing in that way."	E_S1
 
"Nowadays, remote natural environments such as the south Pole are not unaccessible for not only scientists but also tourists."	S_T1
"Some people think this is awful, but in my opinion, this is a great advance for human."	B_S0
"First of all, in the view of scientists, visiting the South Pole is good to their researches."	I_S0
"In the past, scientsts could only study these places by photoes or videos, it is indeed far different from study the remote natural environments in there."	I_S0
"If scientsts stood in the real South Pole, at least the scientsts could feel the climate, the extrame cold there."	I_S0
"The actual feeling of the environments could help the scientists' study."	I_S0
"Beside feelings, scientists could find details not show in both photoes and videos by themselves, because bothe photoes and videos are taken by their authors, not in the view of scientists, so scientists could find out something new if they stand in the South Pole, such as the living behaviors of arctic animals."	I_S0
"Secondly, in the view of tourists, having chances to travel remote natural environments is wonderful."	I_S0
"Image it, when you telling your friends you traveled to South Pole during the vacation, but your friends were all not, is not this makes you different from common people?"	I_S0
"Another reason is that every person have opportunities traveling to South Pole and seeing uncommon sceneries such as the iceberg, iceloos, and wild arctic animals."	I_S0
"This would be unforgettable memories for everyone."	I_S0
"However, some people may concern about tourists could affect scientists' studies in remote natural environments."	I_S0
"In my view, it is not a trouble at all, for example, in the South Pole, the expirement area and the tourism area could be separated, and tourists can only visiting the tourism area."	I_S0
"In this way, the tourists could not affect scientists any more."	I_S0
"In conclusion, I think both scientists and tourists can go to remote natural environments is a wondeful idea and the advantages are definitely much more than disadvantages."	E_S0

"If they can't finish there school work,why can they get their money."	B_S0
"It is not easy for parents to earn money,so the children is impacted to work hard in their school life."	I_S0

"They would make decisions to do part-time job or full time job,which is ealier than other freshmen of university to gain social work experiences."	I_S0
"Also,they can opitimize their communication skills from jobs."	I_S0
"No matter what kind of work students work in,they need to talk to people to make agreements and good relationship."	I_S0

"On the other hand,not only students can do part-time jobs in the spare time of one year,but also they can do something relaxed and get advantages from it."	I_S0
"For example,if students feel stressed about their studies in senior high school,travelings or playing a part in social activities would be an amazing copportunity for them to get rid of their pressure."	I_S0
"So syudents would adjust their minds and emotion to make sure that they can go to university with great passion and attitude one year later."	I_S0
"Additionally,the gap year have risks which may be harmful for graduated syudents from secondary schools."	I_S0
"Compare they with grown adults,they are still too young to face dangers in the society."	I_S0

"Moreover, their organisation capability will have a big enhancement."	I_S0
"For example, they have to arrange some things, and sometimes they need to introduce the work to a newbie; they need to teach everything to newbie."	I_S0
"Thus, they oblige to learn about and organize everything firstly."	E_S0
"In my opinion, volunteering is a decent experience for everyone."	S_M0
"The student can learn how to help other people."	B_S0

"The first rejection made in the lecture is that pterosaurs may be not cold-blooded but warm-blooded, therefore they can produce enough energy which powered flight requires."	B_M0
"The second opposion made by the lecturer is that pterosaurs have hollow bones and special body frames, which means their bodies are not so heavy that they are not able to flap their wings fast enough to stay aloft for any length of time."	I_M0
"The third explaination given by the lecturer about opposing the argument against powered flight is that pterosaurs are not like birds needing to take off by jumping from their legs or running to gain speed and then jumping, instead they have all full limes enabling them to run fast enough and to jump as well as fly high enough."	E_M0
"This means that large pterosaurs do not need big, powerful muscles in their back legs to launch themselves into the air."	S_S2
 
"A majority of people believe that learing a foreign language mainly beacause thet may go to a foreign country."	S_T1
"Others think that it is only one of the reasons."	B_S0
"Personally, the latter view is more understandable."	I_S0
"Nowadays,there are an increasing number of people who want to travel to,study or work in a foreign coumtry."	I_S0

"In my opinion,I support that the positive sides outweigh the negative sides."	I_S0
"It cannot be neglected that gap year may bring various problems."	I_S0
"The main point is that disturbing the constant study will weaken the enthusiasm of sutdy."	I_S0

"On the other hand,the gap year really waste treasure life time for young people who spend one year on relax."	I_S0
"They will face the late graduation compared with other traditonal students and thus,falling behind their own peer."	I_S0
"Althoung there are some disadvantages,gap year still contribute to young people's life and study."	I_S0
"Firstly,as they choose to work and travel after graduation,the newly will help them release the long-time pressure and then,they can own a clearer mind on the further study when they enter the university."	I_S0
"Secondly,the social experience pratice them many social skills such as dealing with interpersonal relationship,communication skils as well as negotiation skills."	I_S0
"Last but not least,student will make a more suitable decision on major in universities,because the experience can broaden their horizons and make them understand which is the best choice."	I_S0

"Additionaly ,these fitness clubs are normally well equipped,people are able to  run ,do yoga or other sports."	I_S0
"After doing these sports, they will feel relax and refresh ."	I_S0
"If there are less sports facilities, after a long-day work ,most people are not willing to go  to some place which is far away to exercise,so they tend to just go home and lack of taking training."	I_S0

"Unknown natrual evrionments are always awashed with amazing secneries as well as scientific puzzles which are fascinated to many tourists and researchers."	S_T1
"Nowadays, increasing amount of people make trips to this places as the North Pole and teh the ANtactic with the help of new technology, however, I am of the opinion that this kind of travelhas more disadvantages than mertis."	B_S0
"Firstly, it has to be noted that the discovring and expoiting of natural environmens are usually companioned with some irreversable damage."	I_S0
"Once a remote place has been regarded as a destination of tourism or any research tri[p, it was forced to confront the problem of being expoloied and developed to somewhere adapt to human activities."	I_S0
"Basic facilities like residence and shops will be built, science equipment will btransported into the land."	I_S0
"This will not only threaten the local ecosystem including the habits of some endabgered species, such as seals and some bears, yet also change some of the crucial geographicai situation here."	I_S0
"Adimitted, travelers may enjoy amazingly wonderful trips gping to this breathtaking landscapes."	I_S0
"they wil bring many risks to both the land and themselves."	I_S0
"It is one of the most common situation is that the visit of travelers will produce a large amout of polutions."	I_S0
"The will bring short lived and environmental-dammaging products alikes disposable bowls and bags to the land which are nonecodegradbel."	I_S0
"Actually, it has been reported by many of the mass media that the tourists of the Antacctic has left too much rubbish there wich is far more beyond the amount it can afford."	I_S0
"Additionally, It is fairly dangerous for untrained tourists to go to this places with some extreme weather or enviromrnt."	I_S0
"It is not rare that we hear about death of chanllenging the moungtain of Qomolamgma."	I_S0
"IN conclusion, I strongly believe that the travelling to remote areas will likely to cause more losses than gains."	E_S0
 
"The chart above shows the data with carbon emissions among six countries in three separately years."	B_I0
"Above, there reveals three countries keep the situation of increase like USA,China and India."	I_I0
"As a result, we can hold the opinion that  China makes the sharp degree of increasing in three different years."	I_I0
"It increases shaply particular iduring 15 years from 60 thousand to 140 thousand ."	I_I0
"However,Germany makes a small degree of decrease in there different years."	I_I0
"Its data probably from 30 thousand to 20 thousand which reveals from the chart among 1900 to 2005."	E_I0
"Compared to this condition,there also exist two countries like United Kingdom and Canada which keeps a stable amount of carbon emmissions."	S_M2
"As we can see in the chart, United Kingdom basisly keep the data about 20 thousand."	B_S1
"Moreover,though Canada has a increase,we can see that it keeps the data about 20 thousand."	E_S1

"Currently,the trend of an increasing number of young adults prefering to quit schooling for some negative thoughts has aroused heating concern."	S_T1
"Parents desire to figure out the causes and copy with the issue."	B_S0
"This essay will analyse above problem and come up with some personal viewpoints."	I_S0
"Firstly,the significant reason can be considerd is the lack of parental education."	I_S0
"With the increasingly intensive social compitition,more and more parents have to overwork to obtain promotion opportunity which is  an essensial facter for the salary and social statu contributing to less time to accompany their child."	I_S0
"Consiquently,the longlyness and less-care may lead the passive emotion for the schooling."	I_S0
"Another possible reason can be thought is the disadvantagous impact from the massive media."	I_S0
"For example,some personas of sitcoms or movies those who are mulbehavior even commit crime also enable to lead a rich and luxious life."	I_S0
"They might be modled by the younger generation."	I_S0
"The students also want to aquire achievemebt whith out preservation."	I_S0
"In conclution,targeting the above problem there are two suggestion can be"	E_S0
 
"Nowadays, the growing waste occur in the place of residence."	S_I0
"Therefore many people want  to have a recycled environment,  they believe gvermental make legislate can help a lot."	B_T1
"I disagree with this idea."	E_T1
"Making laws can force many people to do some recycling activities and ehance the meaning of recycling."	S_M0
"For example, the goverment only allow to throw plastic products in a specific boxes."	B_S0
"If some peole who throw garbage everywhere, they need to do some community severce ."	I_S0
"And it is also a good way for people to have a better use of garbage."	I_S0
"When reducing waste and recycling become a habit, the city will have a better development."	E_S0
"On the other hand, law enforcement discourages recycling."	S_M0
"Due to the goverment need to pay found on minitor to check people's behaviours, and some people will try to break the rules for fun."	B_S0
"This idea is projected to cast a lot of money, but no effectively."	I_S0
"It is difficult for the goverment to conrtol all those who commit crime."	I_S0
"Besides, it is hard to punishment."	I_S0
"If  the goverment putting  everyone goes to jail or just unpaid work is unfair."	E_S0
"In my view, a good choice is that educate every citizens."	S_M0
"Because, if they know the harm of waste, they may release how inportant recgcling are."	B_S1
"Therefore, when people'quality is higher by educating, the phenomenon of waste will naturally become less."	E_S1
"In conclusion, it is a way for the goverment to makes laws."	B_C0
"However, educating residents would be a more effective option."	I_C0
"And,environmental awareness is more inportant than law."	E_C0
 
"Have you ever felt that the noise of the car around your neighbourhood is too loud that you cannot enjoy your beautiful weekend?"	B_I0
"Have you ever felt that it is more difficult to inhale the fresh air in your country?"	I_I0
"As the development of technology, more people imagine and start to believe that there will be fewer cars in use after twenty years."	E_I0
"Neverthelees, I still believe that the usage rate of car will not reduce in twenty years."	S_T1
"On top of that, car is indispensible."	S_M1
"When we own a car, we can go to anywhere we want, and stop by anywhere we like."	B_S0
"However, if people go out by public transit,  they should go to the limited stop station and wait the transportation to come."	I_S0
"Therefore, car is really important in our daily life, because we have no need to go to a far place, and it is more convienent if we own a car."	E_S0
"In addtion, scientists are now try to optimize the cars instead of discard the car."	S_M1
"After all, there are many benefits about cars, and it is hard to devise a new product to replace the cars, it needs time- consuming and money- consuming."	B_S0
"We need to find method to resolve the noise problem, air problem and the resource problem which were caused by cars."	I_S0
"To illustrates, scientists have invented some new instruments to disappear the noise which may have an influence on the neighbourhood, and clean the atmosphere which is gived off by car."	E_S0
"Therefore, I think the usage of car will no"	S_S2
 
"The chart below illustrates the layout of a university sports centre at present and future's plan."	B_I0

"A 25m pool is next to the changing room, and which is located in the centre of the  building."	E_I0
"In the back of the sports centre is the gym."	S_T1
"In the future, the location of reception,changing room,seating and 25m pool will not be changed."	S_M2
"The gym will be expanded."	B_S0
"The weat and east's outdoor courts will be combined with the middle of the centre and the west part will be replaced by a huge leisure pool,another changing room and a sport shop."	I_S0

"Overall, the sports centre will expand and there are more facilities for the students to exercise."	S_C2
 
"In the present age ,it is generally arguable that whether should children be busy with some money-making jobs."	S_T1
"Some people believe that this action is totally wrong while many others argue that paid work can afford work experience which is significant for study and taking obligations."	B_T0
"As far as I am concerned, i am in favor of the former view."	E_T0
"There is no deny that the knowledge taught from schooling lay the foundation for the employment of the young students ."	S_M1
"Hence, children should concentrate on study firstly and mainly."	B_S0
"Moreover, being engaged in some kind of part-time job may occupy their time for study."	I_S0
"For instance, youngster may fall behind the others as a consequence of spending major time on paid work."	I_S0
"Last but not the least, working in flexible society would emerge variety of possible problems."	I_S0
"For example,some child labourer ask children to do some illegal works which could lead to serious physical and emotional hazards."	E_S0
"Admittedly , valuable work experience is beneficial to youngster."	S_M1
"The reason for this is that young students can learn how to take responsibilities and promote their adaptability."	B_S0
"Even so, paid work may make the children to only concentrate on making money instead of study."	I_S0
"Moreover, some youngster would like to step into society and leave off their study."	E_S0
 
"Some people claim that not enough of the waste from homes is recycled."	S_I0
"They say that the only way to increase recycling is for governments to make it a legal requirement."	S_T1
"I think there are some different degrees of monetary punishment for garbage collection in law on it."	S_S2
 
"As we all know,the World Cup football match and the Olympics are held worldwide with great national support and expectations."	S_I0
"As a big fan of those competitions, I agree with the idea that sporting events can be vital for international relations and national unity."	S_T1
"To begin with, the World Cup, Olympics and other international games work for easing tensions among different nations."	S_M1
"For instance, South and North Korea have football games regularly which give two nations a chance to understand each other deeply."	B_S0
"In the 
mid 1990s, a hundreds of North Korean supporters came to South Korea with the footballers and they were very excited during the sporting events."	I_S0
"Even if it sounds ridiculous, many South Koreans were quite surprised at that moment when North Koreans shouted and cried during the match."	I_S0
"Through the sports, two divided nations could reduce their political and ideological tensions and could feel the patriotic unity."	E_S0
"On the other hand, some sports matches can make international relations worse."	S_M1

"Firstly of all, the foundtain in the middle has been changed to a square rose garden with seats surrounding and the stage on west has been changed to a amphitheatre for concerts."	I_S0
"Two entrances remain same."	I_S0
"Northeast corner is replaced by a children's play area instead and the glasshouse changes to a water feature."	I_S0
"Besides north entrances, there is a cafe lying on the east."	I_S0
"There is only the rose garden on the northwest corner of park remains same as well."	E_S0
"Overall, it is clear to see from two maps that how new buildings and facilities in the park are carried out and how it contributes to a more modern and multiple used public park."	S_C2
 
"I agree what watching a movie or reading a book is better to relax than doing physical."	B_T1
"There is three resons."	I_T1
"Firstly,watching movie or book can make person to pure mind themselfs."	I_T1
"Becuase we can receive the store or kownlage very easily,and hardly needs our mind in thinking."	I_T1
"But when we play physical exercise,it will spend our physical energy to make our feel tired."	I_T1
"Moreover,we always think what we shoud do in the physical exercise to get the win in the exercise."	I_T1
"SO doing physical exercise will make our mind in the environment which is not relaxed."	E_T1
"Secondly,watching a movie or reading is postive exercise."	S_M2
"According to the Movie and book can give our massage postively in relaxed time,we just need to recive this massage."	B_S0

"Traditionally, some ancient scholars thounght that natural personality would influence our entire life ."	S_I0
"However, modern citizens  believe that we could change our charateristics via experiences in the future and I am with this opinion."	S_T0
"There are several reasons why I think experiences gained from future life are more significant than natural personality."	S_M1
"Firstly, education and parenting could somehow affect our life and change our natural charateristics."	B_S0
"For instance, some children have poor anger managment and they may be violent in the kindergarten but their parent and teachers do not give them up, they try to teach them how to control themselves and how to communicate with other people without violence."	I_S0
"The result is the children are rescued by these kind and helpful people and they never crime or do other cold blooded things."	E_S0
"Secondly,the knowledge and skills acquired in our entire life play also a vital role on our development."	S_M1
"For example, some people are not naturally patient when they born but they work as a nurse , a teacher or a babysitter."	B_S1
"During the period of learning how to take care of children, they become a patient person."	E_S1
"In my opnion, natural characteristic do affect our life but it is not the primary influence."	S_C2
"No one is born to have great career or to be a leader, in the same logic, nobody is born to be a loser."	B_S0
"We could struggle development in our personality, skills and knowledge by our experiences from school, family, friendship, worplace , voluntary job or even travelling."	I_S0
"So I would say the experience is more essential."	E_S0
 
"In modern society, people always face the delimma to choose whether do similar jobs all day long or try many different types of tasks."	B_I0
"This problem is the much debated one in that it affects everyone in their daily lifes."	I_I0
"Some people argues that the fist statements is more satisfiing , while others agree more on the latter one."	E_I0
"From my perspective, I think the second one is better by all means."	S_T0
"It is convincing that people do same work everyday can master his jobs better, for he can do them orderly without unfamiliar or hesitate on his works."	S_M1
"So he's more effictive and specialize in his field for he spends much of his time on them."	B_S0
"For example, my math teacher is 40 years old now and he began his career since he was 22 years old."	I_S0
"He teaches same concepts for almost 20 years so there's no difficluties in his works and he can cope with all the things very well."	I_S0
"Everyone in our class loves him very much."	E_S0
"However, such jobs aren't satisfied enough for most of the people."	S_M1
"Choosing many different types of tasks can always give you more incentive and motivation to finish them."	B_S0
"Since you will work with many different people and learn many new things,it can give you a sense of achievement and higher quality of your working emotions."	I_S0
"For instance, my uncle is a business man who always need to contact with different people, ont only founders , elites and celebrities but also artists and some blue collar workers."	I_S0
"He always work with these people and do many different jobs, then he can get many background knowledge about different careers and social aspects."	I_S0
"Now he is a very successful business man and masters many skills he learned from others."	E_S0

"With the accelerated pace of life, more and more young people are busy with their work or study in order to adapted to a high-pressured and fast-paced lifestyle."	B_I0
"As a result, they seem to not give enough time to helping their communities."	I_I0
"But due to the policy of the schools and some enterprises, actually young people are more closer to the society."	E_I0
"First, schools gave students some duties which is adding in their required course to accomplish."	S_M2
"University students have to work for the communities for enough time to earn a high grade which will benefit them in the long run such as becoming a graduate or work in some public unit if they decide to pursue further education or land a job."	B_S0
"Take my sister for example, she is a college senior student who major in society."	I_S0
"She needs to join in many uint to finish her paper with full experiences."	I_S0
"So that she invests more time on solving communities problems which made her become more closed to the society."	E_S0
"Second, for some young employees in state-owned enterprise, community service is necessary for then to paticipate."	S_C2
 
"I don't think it's a good idea for parents to offer their school-age children money foreach high grade they get in school."	B_T1
"Because it's important for children in school-age to shape the ideas of learning,which means parents should help their children find real interest in study."	E_T1
"Without telling or encouraging them to think about the real meaning of leaning,they may  think that learning is just a job to earn poket money."	B_S0
"And it's not good for their further study,What's worse,the same ammount of money will become less and less attractice for children ,which means once you start to use this way to help your children you have to keep giving more and more money as he/she grows."	I_S0
"Once you stop giving money,they may not keep studying hard."	I_S0
"And all the parents should understand one symple thing,that you can't be with your children all the time,you can't pay for his improvement forever ,so it's much more important to help them find their own meaning of study,not just money."	I_S0
"And,clearly, just giving money doesn't help."	E_S0
"Of course it doesn't mean that giveing reward is wrong."	S_M2
"Actually, it's a pretty good way to hep and encourage the children if parents know how and what to reward."	B_S0
"For example,when you children get a high grade in school ,you can allow him to plan a trip that he always dream about."	I_S0
"And in that trip,you can chat with your children to know more about his/her interests,and talk to your children to see if there is anyting you can help to develop his interest."	I_S0
"What if he/she doesn't know what his/her interest is,just find more time to help him explore."	I_S0
"Once the interest is found,it will be the biggest motive for him to learn."	E_S0
 
"Environment problem is a significant topic while developing with human society."	B_T1
"There are various of reasons for why environment problems occur, such as scarce animals or plants are broken, pollusions full of air,water or solid."	E_T1
"At the begin with the thought about environment problem is disappearing of some special plants or animals."	S_M0
"Definitely,some plants or animals are the key for ecological system."	B_S0
"For instance, Australian shepherds killed lots of wild wolves to protect their sheeps at once time."	I_S0
"So these sheeps grew up happiness that the grassland was almost void, even huge amount of sheeps were illed."	E_S0
"Therefore, people think they should keep ecological balance by prtect plants and animals."	S_M0
"However,this reason is not extreme right because of the natural selection theory."	B_S0
"Some creates are should disappear like monkey evolve to be human."	I_S0
"Dinosaurs tranfrom thier genes to be birds that fights against the natural disseases and continues lives."	E_S0
"Additionally, not only ecological chain is environment problem, but also there are more factors like chemical pollusions."	S_M0
"Too much carbon dioxide is produced that the quantity of air is discreasing; the industry toxic wayer emition leads water source pollusion; garbage is thrown in the not appropriate place what making solid destroy."	S_S2
"In the summary, environment problems are caused by all kinds of factors."	B_C1
"People should study or learn how to solved them by sythesis and critical thinking instead of bias just one main sound about species disappearing."	E_C1
 
"with the growth of the fast food industry, people's eating habits and health conditions have changed a lot."	B_I0
"Nowadays, in some countries, people are eating too much food with too much sugar and calories, which leads to health problems."	I_I0
"The question is whether it will help if the government raises tax on fast food."	E_I0
"Some people think that it is urgent for the government to raise tax."	S_M1
"As people eat too much fast food, there are more possibilities for them to suffer from obesity, diabetes and heart diseases."	B_S0
"And as a result, they are more likely to be treated by the public medical system which is funded by the tax from taxpayers all over the country."	I_S0
"They benefit from it  more so it is reasonable to impose more burden on them."	I_S0
"And with more budget spent on healthcare system, it can stimulate improvement."	E_S0
"However, others argue that it seems to be with limited help."	S_M1
"Researches have shown that people with lower income tend to choose fast food more."	B_S0
"One possible reason is that because fast food is much cheaper than fresh and organic food and the high calories provide them with sense of satiety."	I_S0
"The condition is that they have no choice but fast food."	I_S0
"If the tax raised, they can not afford either organic food or fast food."	I_S0
"In the meanwhile, people who can afford fast food will still regard them as their lunch because of its convenience and delicious favor."	E_S0
"In conclusion, imposing a higher tax  may not help as well as we imagined."	B_C1
"If a higher tax is put into practice, there will be more social problems, such as poverty and starvation."	E_C1
 
"Many young students leave schools with a negative attitude."	S_T0
"In present-day society,there seems to be a worrying trend that young students hold a negative attitude towards studu after graduation."	B_S0
"The root cause id excessive stredd of study."	I_S0
"To be specific,students in school have to do a large amount of homework after school,which reduces their interest in study an even makes them tired of learning."	I_S0
"Another trigger is that they may face unemoloyment after graduation."	I_S0
"Since there re far less job opportunities avaolable,the competion for jobs becomes increasingly fierce and students are less liely to find a decent job."	I_S0
"Inevitably,some of them may have the feeling that learning is useless."	I_S0
"Accoding to the above mentioned,various approaches should be adopted to deal with this problem."	I_S0
"First of all,reducing study load is the most effective method."	I_S0
"For example,cutting the amount of homework will give students more leisure hours,making them find a balance between study and rest."	I_S0
"In addition,the government hould play a more positive role in creating jobs."	I_S0
"For instance,laws should be mande to impel businesses to recrui students freh out of school."	I_S0
"This will help them build confidence in school education."	I_S0
"To sun up,this unpleasant phenomenon can be attributed to several factors,including study stress and  unemployment."	I_S0
"Relevant methods should be worked out to resolve this prolem before things get worse."	E_S0
 
"For most people, health and longevity are the greatest wishes of a lifetime."	S_I0
"The development of modern society is helping us to realize the wishes."	B_T0
"So I think the improvement of the medical level is more beneficial than harmful to human beings."	E_T0
"First of all, the extension of life expectancy is an inevitable trend of social progress."	S_M1
"The development of our human civilization today has produced many fascinating scientific, cultural and artistic achievements."	B_S0
"Our ancestors, limited by medical conditions, did not live long enough to enjoy in old age what they did not enjoy when they were young."	I_S0
"But now,we can live a full and peaceful life thanks to advances in medical care."	E_S0
"Secondly, the improvement of the level of medical care not only improves the length of our lives, but also the quality of our lives."	S_M1
"Many old people suffer from diseases in their later years, and without advanced medical technology, they would not be happy even if they could live for a long time."	S_S2
"In general, I firmly believe that medical technology is a good thing for us to live longer."	S_C2
 
"Nowadays, the medical industry have a rapid development, more and more new type drugs be made."	B_I0
"People can have a longer life and healthier body."	I_I0
"A heated discussion is that is it benefit for people to living longer and enhance the life expectancy?"	E_I0
"In my opinion, the benefits of this improvement outbalance the disadvantages."	S_T1
"For the advantages, there are many receivable reasons."	S_M2
"Firstly, people can have a wonderful life."	B_S0
"Most of people have heavily  work lord when they aged 30-50."	I_S0
"Only after they retirement, they can spend their time for themselves and their family."	I_S0
"If the life is longer, they can have more time to travel or do anything they want."	I_S0
"Secondly, people who have high-level life expectancy  are more wiling to help other."	I_S0
"Some scientist research that people live in family which harmonious and do not worry about eating are less percentage on crime rate and prefer doing charity."	I_S0

"The lecture shows that the ethanol is the suitable alternative for the fuel by listing possible explanations."	E_T1
"To begin with, the author makes the point that the increasing use of the ethanol will not benefit the environment since the global warming remains."	S_M1
"On the contrary, the lecture illustrates that the increasing adoption on the ethanol will not strength the global warming due to the help of plants."	B_S0

"The following essay will discuss both views in details."	O
"On the one hand, many people believe that it is the government's responsibility to provide standard health care and decent education to their people."	S_M1

"They think that it is unfair because some people might be working hard and paid a large amount of taxes, but others might be indolent or jobless and get the same benefits from the government."	I_S0
"Therefore they believe that healthcare and education should be standalone institutions, and each people should pay for getting a good education and maintaining their own health."	E_S0
"In conclusion, to a certain point, I would agree that it is the government's task to provide education and healthcare for their people, as some poor people might not be able to get a good education and decent healthcare."	S_C2
"However, although these services might be provided by the government for free, each individual's must be responsible for their own education and healthcare, as these services are funded by taxes that are paid by the public."	S_S2

"From my perspective, I think the youth have no influence on the important decisions in society as a whole."	I_T0
"My reasons are as follows."	E_T0
"First, young people today are obsessed with entertainment so they do not want to influence the decisions in their society."	S_M1
"With the high development of Internet, the computer games and applications of short video are more attractive."	B_S0
"Young people who are inmature mentally are likey to play computer games, watch the videos and surf on the Internet for a whole day."	I_S0
"Due to being addicted with entertainment in electric devices, adolescents are not willing to study knowledge and paticipate with other young people in some activities to influence the society."	E_S0
"On top of that, nowadays young people are not prone to communicate and cooperate with others because of the change of interpersonal relationship."	S_M1
"With advanced devices like computers, young people now are like to and are able to solve peoblems alone."	B_S0
"Being reluctant to cooperate with others, they cannot affect the important decision of society as a whole."	I_S0
"On the contrary, in the past, young people have to cooperate to solve the problems in society because they knew that the things could not be solved by one person."	I_S0
"Consequently, they tried to influence the decisions of the future of society together."	E_S0
"Admittedly, some young people are still trying to affeect the decisions that determine the future of siciety."	B_C0
"For example, one of my classmates participates in the design of the subway in my city."	I_C0
"However, he is the only young person in the team."	I_C0
"Young people do not influence the future of the society together."	I_C0
"And when consider the two main elements above, the paticipation is only a minor factor."	I_C0
"To put it into a nutshell, I agree with the statement that young people today have no influence on the significent decisions of the future of society as a whole."	E_C0

"In a nutshell, it is a positive development for masses."	S_C2
 
"Some people hold the opinion that governments should spend more on railways rather than roads."	S_T1
"But I partly disagree with this idea and reckon that both of them are important."	B_S0
"There are indeed many benefits if governments allocate money on railways ."	I_S0
"Firstly,traveling by train or subway is faster than going out by car, because people will not encounter a traffic congestion."	I_S0
"Therefore,for those people whose apartments are far away from the companies, taking a train is a good way for them to avoid being late for work."	I_S0

"This means that people are able to know the specific timetable in advance and arrange their own time more flexible and personally."	I_S0
"Last but not least,railways take an important role in the transport of commodities."	I_S0
"An extensive and comprehensive railway system helps to increase the efficiency of transferring and stimulate the exchange of goods,which promote the development of national economy."	I_S0
"Additionally,the advantages of roads also can not be underrated."	I_S0
"As the most widely-used mode of transport,roads almost connect every two places where people want to go,which enables people to get to the destination directly and without transferring between several modes of transport."	I_S0
"What`s more, in fact, because of they are being frequently used,some of the city roads have worn out even broken up,which is dangerous for those who drive car or just walk on the road."	I_S0
"Thus governments are supposed to take the citezens` safety into considerantion and then repair and maintain these unqualified roads."	I_S0
"In conclusion,govenments should spend money on both railways and roads, for the reason that they contribute to not only the convenience in people`s daily life but also the long-term progress of a country."	E_S0
 
"I think it is a good idea to offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in the school."	S_T0
"Nowadays, the pressure that come from the school bring lots of  influence to the students, so that students really need some different kinds of method to encourage them."	S_T1
"Firsly, parents give the money to their children is a good and easy way to encourage children and that may tells them to it is a mutual relationship between striking and rewards."	S_M0
"After they get the money, they can fight for their marks at the next time."	B_S1
"After a long time, they may have the behavious of hard-working."	E_S1
"Secondly, it is also an other way for the children to get their own money."	S_M0
"They can use those reward to pay for the things that they want to buy for."	B_S0
"It may also educate them how to use their money in a security way."	I_S0
"According to this, the parents may have the oppportunity to give them their own money in an opposite way and improve their grades as the same time."	E_S0
"Finally, the last advantage of offering the school-age children money for each high grade in the school, it may tells those young children how difficult to get the money and how important of hard-working."	S_M0
"After this, that may be a really good condition to let the young children really know their parents pressure and let the children to know more deeply about how money comes from."	B_S1
"That is also a benifit for giving money after the perfect marks."	E_S1
"In conclution, parents offering money can let the children know about how to manage and use the own money, how hard to get for the money and stop young children spend money too much at the same time."	B_C0
"Also, to encourage their school-age students!"	I_C0
"It may not just only improve children's one axcpet instead of let them know other things at the while which brings a lot of benifits."	E_C0
 
"Nowadays, an increasing number of people are capable to pay for more household goods, such as televisions, microwaves, ovens and rick cookers."	S_T1
"It can surely help to make our life more covenient."	B_S0
"Howerer, it might lead to some other issues."	I_S0
"Generally speaking, there are many merits of using these goods."	I_S0
"Firstly, they can help to improve people's effectiveness."	I_S0
"The microwave, for example, can help to save time by heating the foods in a short time while people have something important to deal with."	I_S0
"In addition, people's quality of life has been boosted by using these appliances."	I_S0
"Take televisions as an example, watching TV helps people to spend their leisure time and release tress by sending some interest programs."	I_S0
"However, an increasing number of using these appliances would cause some issues like short of energy."	I_S0
"It must be considered that the more frequently we use household goods, the more energy sources would be cost."	I_S0
"It is clear that overspend use of energy sources would lead to a series of bad effects, which might cause human to be more difficult to survive for a long time, because we have to think about finding more energy, which is still a difficult problem for human beings nowadays."	I_S0
"In conclusion, as far as i am concerned, it is clear that people can win a great number of positive deelopments by using these household appliances."	I_S0
"However, other issues like environment and short of energy should also be considered before we decide to add a new household goods into our house."	E_S0
 
"Nowadays, the ability of adapting is becoming as significant as the knowledge we learn."	S_I0
"This also make sense when it comes to working."	S_T0
"At the present, we cannot have perfect performance unless we are able to adapt to the group we are in."	S_T1
"And socilizing is also crucial in our work, which is something we need to adapt to when we are in a new work environment."	S_T0
"First, we need to coopreate with others to make us work better, for wich we need to adapt to the new environment."	S_M1
"For instance, a university classmates of mine, who was a programmerand  had very good grades in university, had a hard time recently."	B_S0
"According to his words, he could not work well with his collegue which made the groupwork not efficient."	I_S0
"He could not adapt himself to understanding the process of the group work immediately, which resulted in his confusing of what  phase the work enters."	I_S0
"When we got toghther, he told me that there is no better way to make you work well than adapt to the company environment."	I_S0
"Since only if you know excatly how the process the company take to write codes and what strategy company take when meeting problems about the bugs int he codes can you follow your collegues."	I_S0
"Without the ability of adapting, you could be just a fool in the company and do not know how to write your codes."	E_S0
"Second, with good adaptation, we can learn how to get along with the leader and boss to prevent us from being criticized."	S_M1
"The example of Leijun is a case in point."	B_S0
"Leijun works very well about computer and can suddenly solve the problems the company face."	I_S0
"On the basis of this, he could have been praised by the boss."	I_S0
"But in the talking to introduce how he solve the problems, he did not know the temper of the boss and utilized some wrong words which made boss angry, which resulted in his later quitting job."	I_S0
"Afterr he became the EXO of Xiaomi, he talked to the young man and warn them that it was very significant to know how to get along well with boss and leader."	I_S0
"If he could used some words that the leader prefer at that time, it is of high possibility that he would be prompted."	I_S0
"In view of this, we can understand the importance in adapting to new environment which could let us know the leader's likes and dislikes to let them understand our work."	E_S0
"From the two points above, we can excatly know that adapting to new work environment is as important as excellent knowledge, and only with the ability of adaptation can we maximume our work efforts."	S_C2
 
"As parents attach more and more importance to a child's grade in school, they begin to think of as  ways as possible in order to encourge their child to perform better in the lessons."	S_I0
"One choice is to reward them by offering things that they want, such as books, toys, video games, etc."	S_T0
"As days move on, some parents start to set money as a reward for the high grade."	B_T1
"In my perspective, I am totally agree with this kind of encouragement."	E_T1
"The reasons are describled below."	S_S2
"Money is needed even by the school-age children, therefore it is encouraging for the children to get a good mark in the school."	S_M1
"They may use money to buy things that they really want instead of accepting the gifts offered by their parents."	B_S0
"This is a motivation of high grade in school."	I_S0
"When I was in the elementary, I was always hoping to own my football so that I could organize my friends to play together, and parents promised that they would offer me some money to buy a football or whatever I like, if I got a good mark on the coming math exam."	I_S0
"By that means, I worked very hard and eventually I was rewarded by the money."	E_S0
"To provide money for the high grade teaches children how to earn money by their own hands."	S_M1
"As children are not capable to do other works to gain money for their own use."	B_S0
"What could they do if they feel like not demanding from their parents for doing nothing."	I_S0
"Therefore, parents find a reason to give them the chance to show that even children have the ability to earn some money, by working hard and getting a high grade, this will increase a child's fulfillment, which is a helpful way to gain an independent character, as indicated by some developmental psychologists."	E_S0
"Although, to encourage the child by offering money may mislead their intention of study, it is actually a good way to make sure that they have acquire the basic knowledge for their further study and even contains a good impact on their career in the future."	B_C0
"As it is known to us all, that children prefer to play and study makes them upset."	I_C0
"And this fact results in a failure of the grade which may leads to a more profund negative impact on children, worse is that children are not able to notice that."	I_C0
"Parents, as a consequence, should not only persuade them to learn hard by talking but also they are obliged to offer some direct reward, just as some video games could provide them, money is a better choice."	E_C0
 
"It is a commom phenonmenon that a lots of students are leaving schools with negatve attitude on studying in china."	S_I0
"In my opinion,there are many reasons for this."	S_T1
"One of he most important three points."	B_S0
"In the first place,many students not have a good habits in study,so when they leaves school they can't control themself in study behaviour."	I_S0
"Secondly,outside school can not provide a good learning environment."	I_S0
"Last but not least,there is no teacher supervision them to relax the study."	I_S0
"There are many such examples around us."	I_S0
"One of the most typical examples is that my classmate."	I_S0
"He is clever,but he has a very serious problem that he self-control is very pool."	I_S0
"So he is positive in study on school."	I_S0
"However when he stay at home he can not learning in active unless his parents require he read book."	I_S0
"This seriously affected his academic record."	I_S0
"In this situation, I have some ideas about it."	I_S0
"From students's speaking,not only strengthen themself self-control but also relaize important in study."	I_S0
"From the teachers,they can arrangement homework after school and if student didn't complete homework they shoud puishment them."	I_S0
"From the parent,they can help teacher supervise they child study in home."	I_S0
"I hope these suggestions can help them solve the problem."	E_S0
 
"Without doubt, Internet can provide plenty of information about almost everything."	B_I0
"However, now whether acessing so much information creates problems is controversial."	E_I0
"As for me, I think Internet indeed provide us many valuable information."	S_T0
"Firstly, the information Internet can provides is about varities of aspects and almost about everything, which is richer than books or newspapers or other printed things can provide."	S_M0
"As we know, because of the limited length, we can hardly see a book can contain much knowledge, however, this problem is easy to be settled by Internet."	B_S0
"If we use Internet to learn things, we can find many websites have almost everything we may be would like to know."	I_S0
"That's because Internet has unlimited capacity."	I_S0
"For example, if we want to know something about the whole history of humans, there are two methods we can choose."	I_S0
"The first way is to read books and other literature, which means we have to try to find as many books as we can and also only we go to mnay libraries can we find enough books we need."	I_S0
"Sounds we need to pay lot attention."	I_S0
"However, if we can choose the other way, using the Internet, we can easily get many information we want."	E_S0
"Secondly, using Internet means easier way to learn knowledge."	S_M0
"It's widely acknowledged that Internet made our lives more infficient, rapider and more convenient."	B_S0
"Nowadays, people don't have many free time to do what they want."	I_S0
"Most of us just have some break time, and because these time short and limited, it seems hard to make it useful by reading."	I_S0
"If we read during these time, we may even cannot find what we want when we need to go back to work or study again."	I_S0
"However, using Internet is a fascinating way to use these time."	I_S0
"By using the search engines, we can find the information we need faster."	I_S0
"Then we can receive those information everytime and everywhere if we want, just like when we wait for the bus."	I_S0
"It seems better to learn a little instead of doing nothing."	E_S0
"Internet indeed provide us many different information consists of valuable, practicle information or some boring and useless things."	S_M0
"However, it's our duty to indentify what we need and choose the best things to absorb."	B_S1
"Though there are so much information on the Internet that someone may feel confused and puzzled, it is not hard to learn to only learn what is beneficial."	E_S1
"All in all, though the Internet provides so many information may makes someone worried about it, I really believed that what we get whether valuable is up to ouselves, and most of us can get practicle information on the Internet."	S_C2
 
"When it comes to the topic of satisfactory of workers, it occurs to my mind immediately that working with different types of tasks is the distinction between workers and robots and it is also the source of satisfactory."	S_I0
"To start with, different types if tasks can cultivate more skills than similar tasks."	S_M0
"Different types always mean facing with different challenge in one day, and using skills in different aspects in a short time."	B_S0
"However, similar tasks mean doing the same things for the whole day, and the problem the workers meet is the same everyday, which is sure to lead to the result that the workers forget other skills and have no chance to learn new skills in their work."	I_S0
"Obviously, the former can make the life filled with challenge and chance, which can make the workers more satisfied."	E_S0
"Besides, different types of tasks can enrich worker's life but similiar tasks just make workers feel bored."	S_M0
"For example, my uncle is an officer who was asked to type all the day."	B_S0
"And he always complains he believes he is just like a robot."	I_S0
"It is true that only robots do the same things everyday and don't complain."	E_S0
"Thirdly, completing different types of tasks facilates the development of a sense of achievement, which can make workers satisfied with their work in return."	S_M0
"The less types of tasks a worker can complete, the easier the worker can be replaced by others."	B_S0
"This will result in the fear of workers that they will be afraid of losing their job all the time, let alone being satisfied to their work."	I_S0
"On the other hand, if they can see how valuable they show during completing many different types of tasks, they will get safety and get the achievement."	I_S0
"Naturely, they will be content with their work."	E_S0
"According to what I have mentioned above, it is obvious that workers are more satisfied when they h"	O
 
"I agree this reasons."	S_T0
"Firstly,we all know the old saying that he who keeps company with the dogs will catch up with the dogs."	B_S0
"So i can not agree with family has a powerful influence on children 's life."	I_S0
"I admit that family factors are an important part in educating children,But this is only a child's home education, when he grew up and experienced a lot of things, can really understand the parents say those truths,school education and social experience affect people in every way."	I_S0
"When people are in an unfamiliar environment, they have more opportunities to acquire more knowledge and gain richer experience,they must cultivate a variety of relationships and learn to skillfully handle them in order to maintain and promote better development."	I_S0
"At home, you may be a treasure in the hands of parents."	I_S0

"If you do, do you think you ignore things that you shoud do?"	E_I0
"I always do things I like to do, but I do not think that I spend little time on things I should do."	B_T0
"Therefore, I disagree that people today spend too much time on things they like to do rather than they should do."	E_T0
"There is a couple of specific facets why I think in this way."	S_T1
"Initially, people today spend much time on things they like to do, and most of these things are also things they should do."	S_M1
"Nowadays people have chance to choose works that they like, so they always do things they like to do."	B_S0

"Some poeple think that students are more influenced by their teachers than by their friends."	S_I0
"I tend to diagree with this statement for several reasons."	B_T0
"First, the things that students are deprived from teachers may just be knowledge."	I_T0
"Teachers are responsible for teaching us knowledge."	E_T0
"In that case, many teachers are just spread their knowledge to their children and they will not teach students philosophy about how to be a good person."	B_S0
"For example, the classes of my math teacher are full of math knowledge, however, he never talked about how we can get through the difficulties when we are studying math."	I_S0
"His class is tedious, and we cannnot learn anything but some fomulas in math and methods of solving math problems."	I_S0
"Therefore, we did not get any influence from him."	E_S0
"Second, students spend lots of time with their friends."	S_M1
"It is apparent that people will be influenced if they are with some people for a long time."	B_S0
"Students always play games, have meals, gossip with their friends."	I_S0
"Under this circumstance, the behaviors or thoughts of friends will definitely affect you."	I_S0
"For example, if your friend always like to wear casual clothes like jeans, sneaker, and T-shirt, you would probably change your dressing style to wear those informal clothes."	I_S0
"This is a natural behavior, and it cannot be preventted."	I_S0
"On the contrary, teachers just give you classes, and students barely spend time talking or being with their teachers after class."	I_S0
"In that case, it is hard for students to get more influence by their teachers."	E_S0
"Third, students and teachers have generation gaps, which may make students do not want to listen to their teachers."	S_M1
"Some students always think that what the teachers said is useless in this current society so they will not get impact by it."	B_S0
"For example, one of students in my class think that teachers are exaggerating the importance of getting into a colledge because he thinks that people in the past are not like today that citizens really have good skills will finally succeed even without a degree."	I_S0
"In that case, he will not get influenced by the teacher."	I_S0
"While later his friends told him that how hard it is for the brother of his friends to get a good job without a college diploma, he is convince by him."	I_S0
"Consequently, students are more likely to be influenced by their friends becaue there is no generation gaps between them so students are willing to liten to."	E_S0
"To sum up, I disagree that students are more influnced by their teachers than by their friends."	B_C1
"This is because some teachers only teach students knowledge, students spend lots of time with their friends, and there is no generation gap between students and their friends."	E_C1

"The ones who keep making friends usually have so many friends that it is impossible for them to remain friends for a long time."	B_S0
"However, if we focus on maintaining our friendships and spend more time on a small group of people, it is not strange to remain friends for the whold life."	I_S0
"For example, my grandfather met his best friends 60 years ago."	I_S0
"When my grandfather gets together with his old friend, they laugh a lot and forget all the disappointments, as if they are as young as 60 years ago."	I_S0
"None of the other friends can bring such happiness to my grandfather."	E_S0
"In addition, the friendship will be fasten and will not break up easily, if you keep maintaining it."	B_C0
"Many people make friends easily because of their apperance or status."	I_C0
"However, if they don't maintain the friendship, once the emergency occurs, all his friends will forget them."	E_C0
"They actually don't have any true friends."	B_S0
"On contray, if you spend more time with friends and keep maintain the friendship, they will never leave you behind and be willing to help you overcome the difficulties."	I_S0

"After that, I'd like to see a movie, what I have to do is just switch the remote control and go for CCTV 6, how convinient it is!"	I_S0

"As we all know, large quantity always leads to poor quality because of carelessness and unresponsibility."	I_S0
"Those programs with poor quality which are unable to play on TV now do have the chance because of the large quantity of channels."	I_S0
"As always the case, I turn on the TV and find nothing I'm interested in, then I have no choice but turn it down and try to find something others to kill my time."	I_S0

"Firstly,socail tempts influence there mind a lot."	I_S0
"Young students do not set up a right acquaint about society."	I_S0

"they may instigate young aged students to do the bad things that can benefit themselves."	I_S0
"Lastly,young people can impact by others more easily."	I_S0
"They can not control themselves well when they are facing some unexpected situations."	I_S0
"It is diificult for them to deal with socail things alone."	I_S0
"In my opinion,it is not a good idea to drop out at a young age."	I_S0
"Students should finish their studies first and do not consider some socail events too early."	I_S0
"I have some positive suggestions for the students who had already drop out or someone who want to leave school."	I_S0
"Firstly,do not drop your study too early."	I_S0

"However, i prefer to give the money to charitable organizations and let them decide how the money will be spent, and it is based on the following reasons."	S_T1
"First of all, I think charitable organizations have more broad platform and more information of the people who need help so they can better give assistance to those people."	S_M1
"Chartable organizations are more professional  on doing charity, because they have professional people to find people who need help, they can based on data statistics to decided what they need."	B_S0
"Those are the things that a normal person can't get , so if we decide how the money is spend, we can't do as perfect as the charitable organizations."	I_S0
"Therefore i will give the money to the charitable organizations."	E_S0
"What’s  more, I think the power of a team is larger than individuals, so give money to charitable organization is better."	S_M1
"We can't donated lots of money by only ourselves and we can't make sure to insist on doing charity."	B_S0
"So give the money directly to the needy may not help them a lot."	I_S0
"Also we can't decide what things they really need."	I_S0
"For example, if we give a poor family a mount of fruits, although our goal is to help them, but they don't really need it."	I_S0
"So it will be a waste of money and didn't benefited  on both."	I_S0
"But the organizations will be different, they collect money and can give actually help to those people, they may have large influence because of 
Therefore, I tend to donate money to charitable organizations rather than to the needy directly."	I_S0
"The principle behind the reasons is simple: those institutions do things better than do individuals."	E_S0

"Individuals in 1985 traveled on average 4740 miles per year and this figure increased to 6475 in 2000."	O
"Some modes of transport were used less frequently in 2000 than in 1985."	S_M1
"Most strikingly, on average, each person traveled 429 miles in 1985 in local buses but only 274 in 2000."	B_S1
"There were less dramatic decreases in the popularity of walking and cycling, from 255 to 237 miles and 51 to 41 respectively."	E_S1
"On the other hand, the English traveled more using other forms of transport between 1985 and 2000."	S_M1
"Not only did they drive cars much more often (from 3199 miles to 4806 per person each year), but also they traveled in taxis much more frequently (from 13 miles to 42)."	B_S1
"Besides, the numbers of miles they traveled on long-distance buses and trains rose by similar amounts, from 54 to 124 and 289 to 366 respectively."	E_S1
"In sum, although the distance individuals traveled using various modes of transport changed, they traveled more than they had in total."	S_C2
"In both years, the most frequent mode of travel was by car."	S_S2
 
"In this generation, the students grow up in a completely diffrent enviroment differing from their parents."	B_I0
"And how to reward their children is a really hard nut for parents to figure out."	I_I0
"Hence, there is a interesting debate on the floor, whether partents use money to reward their children when they get good grades in school."	E_I0
"From my perspective, I strongly support this idea."	S_T1
"First and formost, it can encourge students to study hard."	S_M0
"Every one loves money, no one is exception."	B_S0
"Even the young children know the neccesity of the money which can let them be able to do something like playing advanced comupter games, buying equipments they eager for a long time."	I_S0
"These tempations are not easy to resist."	I_S0
"And now, there is a method which can help them reach their dream objetcs easily --- getting a high-level grade."	I_S0
"For students, their duty is to study hard for the higher scores and these kinds of rewards give them motivation to work hard terribly to gain both the grades and the rewards which meet their need."	I_S0
"Once they become aware of the benefits of it, they will be situmulated to fight for the next exams."	I_S0
"Go round and roung, this will become a perfect cycle for the students."	I_S0
"From my own experience, since I was in primary school, my parents were ordered me some money wheneve I got higher ranking in my class and my grade."	I_S0
"I could be able to buy some comics that I loved most at that time and was excited when I stood in front of the counter of the bookstore."	I_S0
"In that case, being attacted by the monthly journal, I workd hard in every mothly examinations to get money from my partents buying the comics I wanted."	E_S0
"Moreover, this way of rewarding releases the burden of parents."	S_M0
"Nowardays parents have no time to think deeply how they praise their children when the do a good job in their study."	B_S0
"They even have no time to get known their children in depth."	I_S0
"They don't exactly know what their children really want."	I_S0
"In addition, owing to the generation gap, there is something just familiar with the school-age children which their parents will be disordered."	I_S0
"As a result, if parents buy something just they think good for their children, it may lead to a bad consequence, creating a family confilict in some extent."	I_S0
"Therefore, giving money to their children is really covenient choice for their parents."	I_S0
"To illustrate, my cousin loves Taylor Swift very much, but my uncle just knows that his son loves overseas music."	I_S0
"So he buys his son an album from Avril, and then they have a fight between the two stars."	I_S0
"After this unhappy experince, my uncle decides to give money to his son directly letting him choose whatever he wants."	E_S0
"Admittedly, it may creates a utilitarian mind in the scool-age children which is bad for them."	S_M0
"However, partents have the ability to control the amouts of money that they give to their children, which will not form a unhealthy thought if the parents have the awareness."	B_S0
"On the other hand, children will still walk into the society."	I_S0
"It can help them know how to manage their money since they are in childhood."	E_S0
"Overall, both for children and parents, offering money directly is a good choice."	S_C2
 
"In the present age, lots of children have more free time ."	S_I0
"But in the meantime whether  children to do in their free time has sparked much debate."	B_T1

"Personally,I am favor of the former view."	E_T1
"FIirstly, I think group activity is the most interesting things in child life."	S_M2
"You can learn how to deal with people,sometimes you can make like-minded friends."	B_S1

"Teachers all around the words try to find the best way that can let students learn a lot."	B_I0
"Some tecchers believe that assign project on which students must work together, the students learn much more effective, since they can help each other and develop the team spirt."	E_I0
"However I am a firm believer that it is the best way that students work along on projects."	S_T1
"The first reason is that students can develop the skill of solving problem by themselves through working along on a project."	S_M1
"During a project, multiple difficultes and obstacles are inevitable."	B_S0
"If a student work with other in a team, she can ask for help."	I_S0
"As a reslut, her teammates can learn a lot in the project reather than her."	I_S0
"In contrast, working along one a project will push a students to tackle the difficulties by herself."	I_S0
"In other words, in order to solve difficulties a students will read many books; a students still can practice the communication skill by asking others; a student will search on the internet to find resources."	I_S0
"In this case, a student can learn many skill and knowledge rather than ask for help and waiting for the anwsers."	E_S0
"The second reason is that student can experience different work in one project."	S_M1
"In a group everyone will have a task."	B_S0
"If a student solve the task, this student can relax rather than help others."	I_S0
"Working along, however, need to do every process by hisself or herself, which means a student can get more experiences during the work."	I_S0
"In the future, these experience might help a student in the job hunting."	I_S0
"As my sister for example, after she gurduated she tried to find a job."	I_S0

"Do you often watch movie and tv during the free time?"	B_I0
"Do you always want to watch movies and tv during your study time?"	I_I0
"Nowsday a lot of young people like watch movies and tv during their free time and these movies also influent the concentration when they study."	I_I0
"Moreover watch too much movies or the tv is not good to the cultiavate of the characteristic of the young people."	E_I0
"So I agree with the point that the watching movies and tv have more negative effects on the way the young people behave."	S_T0
"Firstly, watch too much movies or tv will have negative effects to young people's study."	S_M1
"It is a very important time to study knowledge when people are young."	B_S0
"So we may pay more attention on our acdamic assignment."	I_S0
"If there is a very interesting tv programm that will play soon, we may lose our concentration during the study beause at the time the thing that full of the young people is the interesting talking and plots in this peogramm."	I_S0
"even though these young people have not finish the assignment that the professor gave to them, They also will put the important study down and shift the attention to the tv."	I_S0
"It is very terrible, because of the tv programm they may stay up very late at night."	I_S0
"And these young people will sleep during the class or work."	I_S0
"So watching too much movies and tv is not good to the future of these young people."	E_S0
"Secondly, paying too much attention to watch movies or tv will replace the time they read book."	S_M1
"In the past, a lot of great people thought the books were the wealth of the life."	B_S0
"Reading a lot of book will expend the outlook of the young people and also in order to make them thinking."	I_S0
"By these way they will have their own thinking about some question and create some new things by themselves."	I_S0
"But if the funny movies or tv programm replace the books, these young children will never think."	I_S0
"And even more they just rely on the limited information from the tv or movies and do not want to learn something deeply."	I_S0
"It will have great negative effect to these young people's  study and work in the future."	I_S0
"Finally they will lose the competitive in these social and be gave up by the community."	E_S0
 
"with the development of global society, it is a commonplace that international communications are frequent day by day."	S_T1

"I totally agree with this opinion."	E_S1
 
"I think it's good idea."	S_T1
"For that student who can get achievement in their study or research they should get bonus because their achievement in the study."	B_S0
"Like the scientists or artists get achievement in their own academic field like become the first person who solve the problem noone haven' solve yet，or the artists publish the book which had influences in the society."	I_S0
"The goverment will give them bonus to thank their achievement in the researches."	I_S0
"The students are same like that."	I_S0
"If you are the student who is working hard in some subject,or you get much progress,I think it is a good way to award them by materially thing ."	I_S0
"I think it can encourage them and they will working harder than befrore,they will get more achievement in their research ."	I_S0
"Like me I'm the student who can't get much achievement in my study but I m' the student who never give up in my study,so if I get some progress in my study my parents will very happy they always give me the things I want."	I_S0
"In that way I will working hard than before I will get more progress in the future."	I_S0
"I think It's a good way to offer theie school age students money for each high grade."	I_S0
"I also think if the student can get achievement in study they also can controal them in using the money."	I_S0
"I believe them."	E_S0
 
"Different people have different ideas."	B_I0
"But i think it is right."	I_I0
"It's a wise way."	I_I0
"Nowadays, further more students cost money on the no-books."	I_I0

"Like drug, game room, KTV."	B_S0
"Only if the children have the good habit."	I_S0
"They can improve thire grade."	I_S0
"Secondly, If they have good grade in the school."	I_S0

"Nowadays, many young students have negative thoughts on studying when they have finished their cources at school."	S_T0
"This phenomeno is not what tachers, experts and students'parents want."	B_S0
"It is high time to anlylize the situation and find some approaches to solve it."	I_S0
"As far as I am concerned, there are three causes."	I_S0
"First, students are too young to realize the importance of education."	I_S0
"Young students prefer vivid extracuriculum activities, making them get bored tedious school courses."	I_S0
"pursuing freedom is nature of tenagers."	I_S0
"Second, some students may find that what they have learned at school are useless for their daily life and for job seeking."	I_S0
"Schools have many courses which are lack of practice opportunity."	I_S0
"After young students have abtained the theory, they cannt find the chance to put theory into practice, making them cannot realize the value of this theory."	I_S0
"Soon, students are not willing to spent time on these courses but they have to finish their education plan, the plan forcing them to study."	I_S0
"Third, rank system or the like put so much pressure on these tanagers."	I_S0
"They have to take tests, and their scores are used to compared with others by their parents and teachers."	I_S0
"These actions may make studnts annoyed, which have nagetive effects on their willings to study."	I_S0
"Above all, some approaches have to be taken."	I_S0
"there are some suggestions."	I_S0
"Schools are supposed to arrange more extracuriculum activities."	I_S0
"Students want happiness from these activities."	I_S0
"What is more, practice of theory abtained at class is needed."	I_S0
"Only by this action, students can realize the nessecity of the courses they study."	I_S0
"Last but not the least, test is needed, but the results of tests are not supposed to be used to compare with one another."	I_S0
"Everyone's score is somewhat a privacy and should not put off or get"	E_S0
 
"Now more and more people tend to keep changing jobs."	S_I0

"On the one hand."	S_M0
"Working for the same companies all their working life."	B_S0

"When they retire, they will have stable benefits from company also."	I_S0
"And a inportant thing is making many friend with many colleagues."	I_S0
"they can hold the relationship in them life"	E_S0
"On the other hand."	S_M0
"If you just graduated from college,you will not have enouth experience form working."	B_S0
"Adapting to the atmosphere of different companies helps to improve their social skills."	I_S0
"And they will understand what work is really suitable for them in this period."	I_S0

"When it comes to dream, different people have different opinions."	S_I0
"Thus, a controvsial topic has been aroused: should people follow their dream even if the dream is too far to reach."	B_T1
"Some claims that we should chase the realistic goals."	E_T1
"However, contrary to their view comes my perspective that everyone is supported to follow their heart no matter how hard to achieve the goal."	S_T0
"My point is well elaborated as follows."	S_T1
"To begin with, it is the ambitious dream that can encourage us to try our best to success."	S_M2
"To illustrate, the long-range dreams always serve as the stimulation to constantly urge on people and give us the huge of sense of achievement."	B_S0
"Therefore, when people faced with the difficult in the process of chasing goals, it is less likely for the people who have the ambitious goals to give up."	I_S0
"However, if people merely set the easy achieving goals as the fear of failure, chances are that they won't make process."	I_S0
"For example, when my sister is five years old, she wanted to become a speaker."	I_S0
"Given that she was a stammerer and she chould even speak clearly, my parents just persuide her to give up this dream."	I_S0
"However, with the encourage of speaking around the world, my sister always mimics the vedio of success speaker, stands in front of the mirror and practices 5 hours a day."	I_S0
"10 years pasting, she now can speak confidently and logically."	I_S0
"and she always repre"	E_S0
"In addition, the most important thing people can obtian from the dream is the process instead of the result."	S_C2
"To elaborate, when people are chasing the dream, they have to spend more and more time enhancing themselves insted of doing unmeanful things, learn plenty of skills to macth the goal and improve their courages to face failure."	S_S2

"Also individual can use more pubilc transportation than use their private car, so that the carbon dioxide emissions will be reduced."	I_S0
"Second, goverment and big compaines can also do the effort to environment."	I_S0
"In my opinion, I think that goverment and big compaines have more influence on pubilc, they can encourage more people to take paricipate in the eco- friendly activities."	I_S0
"Also, they may provide the fund to set up a factory to purify the polluted water or bulid more subways or plant more trees to reduce and absorb the polluted air."	I_S0
"Third, individuals and goverment should cooperate together."	I_S0
"Because goverment advocate the eco-friendly activity and the individual can respond the activity."	I_S0
"Both are benefit for our enviorment."	I_S0
"So I think that it is a wrong view about the individual cannot improve environment but only governments and big compaines can."	I_S0

"Someone claims that these action is futile and costly."	E_I0
"However, in my opinion, it is vital to improve the safety and improving appearence."	S_T0
"The reason is elaborated as follows."	S_S2
"First, the safety can be an adventage over other attractions to attract tourists."	S_M2
"Vacation is a way to release people's presure and no one want their vaction to touble themselves."	B_S0
"As a result, tourist always priortizes the safety and are concerned about the criminal rate of the city."	I_S0

"Recently, an interesting discussion has aroused among public: whether students are supposed to be provided more time to do what they want to do."	B_T1
"Some people claim that children should spend more time on doing homework or joining in activities that are held in school."	E_T1
"However, I think young students should spend more time on whatever they want."	S_T0
"My reasons and examples are shown below."	S_T1
"Primarily, successful people cultivate their hobbies when they were children."	S_M0
"Normally, children's hobbies are not related to staff in school so they have little time to discover or develop their hobbies because they have to go to compus activities after school."	B_S0
"And if children can spend more time on their hobbies they are usually open-minded and have specialists which gives them more options to choose when they grow up."	I_S0
"For example, my little brother likes playing computer games and he begins to interested in making games so he learns programming online and now he is a very successful programmer in Tencent even if he is poor in sports."	E_S0
"Additionally, children who spend time on what they want to do have a good studying condition."	S_M0
"This is because they daily lives are full of what they likes and they have the chance to stay with them which makes them satisfied and cheerful."	B_S0
"Therefore, they have a relaxing condition and they can pay full attention to class."	I_S0
"For instance, when I was a child,I like watching movies and I usually spend 2 hours a day on watching time and I feel my daily lives are relaxing and abuntant so I can be relaxed to take classes."	E_S0
"Granted, children spend most of their time on school activities or sports can may have wonderful school life."	S_M0
"However, those young students usually do not have many spical skills and are really common."	B_S1
"Because they all experience same activities and do the same thing together all the time."	E_S1
"In conclusion, children are supposed to be given more time to do whatever they want which can make them successful in the future and also let them have a good studying condition in class to get a good grade."	S_C2

"It is noteworthy that German consumption exceeded more than 50 biliion kwh of its generation, being the only country showing an adverse pattern."	E_S0
 
"Nowadays the way people interact with each other has changed because of technology."	B_I0
"Yes, the technology has changed the people’s interaction in very enhanced manner."	I_I0
"Earlier people use to wait and try to find easy way to contact their friends or relatives leaving far."	I_I0
"In past there was no quick technology to contact or to establish any communication between one person to another person."	I_I0
"The drawback with past communication systems was that it were very slow and were time taking process such as telegrams, letter etc."	E_I0
"People used to afraid to write their personal feedbacks or things to their love ones due to insecure medium of communication."	S_T0
"When it comes to professional level, the privacy and accuracy should be maintain but, to that time there were no secure communications."	S_S2
"Now the things have changed around, people from far distance contact their loves one in an easy and quick ways which improves the interaction level between two person."	S_M2
"Quality the level of the interaction between people to people, has improved because the people are equipped with high-tec technology which enhances the communication."	B_S1
"There are many many medium which are available now such as internet, called cards etc."	E_S1
"The technology has provided the mobility faster which help people to talk or to interact at any time anywhere in the world."	S_C2

"It has become so easier and friendly to be in touch with your friends, relatives even with the unknown people."	E_S1
 
"Nowaday, suatainability is important in many areas, and people concern the environment they live, some people want goverment to make a law to help recycle, but I do not think that laws can effectively help solve current environmental problems."	S_T0
"The waste of homes should be recycled, but it should depend on the type of the waste, we can not recycle all waste, we can just do our best to recycle."	S_M1
"To increase the rate of recycling, goverments can develop new technology to enable more garbage to be recycled, this needs goverments to invest more on development."	B_S1
"What's more, the different way to increase recycling is to increase public attention and teach them how to recycle waste, goverments should increase publicity and popularize education on environmental protection, enacting laws can be too strict to public, and no one should be punished if he do not know which kind of waste should be recycled."	E_S1
"As I say,making it a legal requirement is not the only way to increase recycling, and laws are too strict."	S_M1
"But on the other hand, sometimes laws can be useful, like no littering, no spliting,  laws can change the social atmosphere to a certain extent, and it is powerful to constrain people from doing excessive things."	S_S2
 
"I think the advantage outweigh disadvantage."	S_T0
"Firstly,when we were in senior high school,all knowledge we got was from books and teachers,so they were just some theories,and we had no opportunity to use them."	B_S0
"When we finished our senior high school study."	I_S0
"I think it's the best time to find kmowledge which we had studied in our daily life,isn't it true?"	I_S0
"Secondly,when we graduated from high school,all of we are adults who at the age of 18,we have many dreams and activities."	I_S0
"It was the most wonderful time that let these ideas come true."	I_S0
"I still remeber when I was 18,I used nearly 4 month to travell around China,which is my biggst dreams for many years."	I_S0
"Also,Mrs.white,my English teacher in high schhl,had spent one year working in Japan before she went to university."	I_S0
"In fact,both of us reveived a lot,and neither her nor me think it's just waste time ahd energy now."	I_S0
"These are my explanations for my view."	I_S0
"Maybe some of people still think it is a stupid behaour."	I_S0
"but I just want to ask you,why not follow you heart when you are a such young man?"	E_S0
 
"As a vital component of high school education,community service should always be a part of the whole eduacational system."	B_T1
"Personally ,i could not agree more because not only students but also the whole society can benefit a lot from unpaid service."	E_T1
"Admittedly,unpaid jobs for charity prganazation take up some of the time students need to spend more valuable time on their studies."	B_S0
"Namely,in a short term,this acticity cannot bring any reward for the study of those participants."	I_S0
"However,people should never judge activities with a shortsighted view
Obviously,establishing community service as a mandatory part of high school education is not only helpful for students but also meaningful for the whole society,Firstly,both text-based and society-based methods make up the whole structure of the high school education,Community service perfectly combines both parts in order to accomplish a better outcom for those students because they have the opportunity ton put their newly learnt theories,such as theories of social work,into practice."	E_S0
"Secondly,throughout these charitable activies ,students can work with disabled people,so they are likely to pay more attention to these special groups and understand them better in their daily life."	S_M2
"More importantly,it will shape their strong and independent personalities gradually."	B_S0
"Namely,offering help to others teaches the young to understand and support each other in the community."	I_S0
"In sum,it is a must to add community service to the compulsory education,especially in high schools,Through such service,students can gain both social experiences and working skills that will contribute to their competence,In addition,it is also meaningful for the whole society because students konw more about and understand the society better."	E_S0
 
"Some studies indicates that our development and personality are affected mainly by the characteristic we born with."	S_T1
"However, there are still a lot of people argue that the experiences have more influence on peoples' personality and development."	B_T0
"From my own perspective, I think experinces we might have is the major influence."	E_T0
"There is no denying that the characteristics plays a significant role in human's growth."	S_M1
"The genetic influence which have certain differences among human beings can affect human's characteristic."	S_S2
"Nevertheless, I believe the experiences we may have in our life are more noticeable during the growth of human's life."	S_M1
"The experinces have much more influence on people's development."	B_S0
"For instance, we can see that the children of a majority of elite families in the United States will also become elites in the future."	I_S0
"There is no evidence that the genes of rich people are born differently from the poor people or their characteristics is better than the poor."	E_S0

"A number of students are leaving schools with negative thoughts on study,in my opinion,this phenomenon can be suscribed by following reasons:"	S_S2
"First,the study they majored in are complicated for them."	S_I0
"Every field has its difficulties,High failture level and the teaching method of the teacher may be the factors of this problems."	S_T1
"Many students are scared by the courses."	S_I0
"Second,they dislike their major."	S_T1
"Many students with nagetive thought of study are getting strong stessed of thier parents,thier parents force them to choose the major they dislike which may be the problems."	B_S1
"I have a friend who was majored in chemistry,but he hated the cource of the major ,so as his teachers,in a special period he refused to study,however,he eventually picked up his course and made up his mind to change his major to physics."	E_S1
"How lucky he was."	B_I0
"Here are some suggestion from me:"	E_I0
"At first,I suggest them to get some experience from the students in higher level."	S_M2
"In fact,a large number of them had the smilar question as you in the same period,they can give you some pratical ideas which are much useful for you."	B_S0
"And then,if they do not want to carry on thier major any more,they can try to transform to another major which they prefer to."	I_S0
"Most of the univercity provide the chance for students to change thier major after they enter the school,I strongly suggested them to catch this oppotunity."	E_S0
 
"The tendency of langugage's diminishing has aroused a heated discussion."	B_I0
"Someone argues that fewer languages make our life easier,which seems to be sensed."	E_I0
"However,I have to disagree with the view to a large extent."	S_T1
"Firstly,various of languages reprenst different cultures."	S_M2
"Secondly,citizens gain a sense of belonging as well as proudness when they speak their own language."	B_S1
"Last but not the least,it is of significance to grasp a good understanding of different languages."	E_S1
 
"It is normal for some people to think learning a foreign language is aimed to travel to or get a job in a foreign country because there actually exist a lot nations which have their own special cultures or attractive work chances."	S_T1
"This kind of people may not want to immgrate to another country, they just expect to have a short-time 
journal or a special work experience."	B_S0
"At the same time,  there exist many people hold a different opinion that traveling and working are not the only reasons for us to learn a second language."	I_S0
"These people thinck only if you really enjoy doing something,  then you can accept it completely and achieve the goal."	I_S0
"Therefore, from their perspective, indivisual should know clearly why he choose a foreign language to study and if he really love  this
language."	I_S0
"In my opinion, to travel or to get a great job can be the only reason to learn a second language."	I_S0
"I think most of people are not willing to  leave their own nation and stay abroad by themself."	I_S0
"Therefore, people who choose to get to know another language mainly from they looking forward to a high salary job or a wonderful journal at a strange nation and they may not enjoy another nation's culture and life-style, so many of them may still choose to back to their original country."	I_S0
"It is especisally common for my university teachers, many of them are just go abroad to study and work for a few years in order to get a professor job in"	E_S0
 
"In the present age, individuals tend to have an access to the same commodities all over the world."	S_I0
"There is a tendency to believe that separate countries consequently becoming more similar have potential dangers."	S_T0
"Nevertheless, this argument is ill-founded and I will explain why."	S_T1
"It may be reasonable to assume that rising similarities between different countries negatively affect certain countries’ innovation development."	S_M1
"What is meant by this is the willing of companies in those countries to develop high-tech products."	B_S0
"This is probably due to that the motivation to upgrade commodities comes from the intensive competition in the world market, which can be reduced if the market is able to provide the same products anywhere."	I_S0
"However, this problem can be effectively addressed if authorities offer a large quantity of funds to support the enterprises' research work."	E_S0
"The merits of countries becoming more similar, on the other hand, are multiple."	S_M1
"One noticeable positive effect is that it contributes to the amelioration of residents' living standard."	B_S0
"To be more specific, this improvement results from the fact that citizens' diverse needs of products can be met."	I_S0
"For example, people in the whole world can eat fruits which can only be produced in some tropical areas."	I_S0
"Apart from increased living standard, there is every possibility that these similarities lead to the growth of global economy."	I_S0
"This is mainly because economy tends to develop at an increasing pace when international trade is  prosperous, which is attributable to the provision of same products around the world."	E_S0
"In the final analysis, more similarities showed in diverse countries have engendered a wide array of benefits, including improved living standard and economic growth."	B_C1
"Therefore, I firmly believe this trend has much of a positive role to play in the development of the world."	E_C1
 
"In current society, there has been some debate about which types of progress is crucial for a government."	S_T1
"From my prespective, every type of progress is significant for a country, but economic progress is more fundamental goal than other progress."	B_S0
"Some politicians thinks that economic development is the government's essential target."	I_S0
"Firstly, economics development can provide the financial support for other types of development."	I_S0
"It is commonly believe that the other types of progess (such as, education, health care, technology and so on) need to be supported by wealth."	I_S0
"Conseqiently, economic development is the first priority."	I_S0
"Secondly, it can deliver a batter life to citizen."	I_S0
"This is mainly because, economic progess can help the government to earn more money which can be use to imporve commounal facilities."	I_S0
"For example, the transport system which can facilitate citizen to travel or work."	I_S0
"It is undeniable that other types of progess are crucial for a society as well."	I_S0
"This is primarity because capitial is not the only part of our country."	I_S0
"In other word, the government need to develop other aspects in the country."	I_S0
"For example, developing education is a necessary part of a country."	I_S0
"Once the government developing education, there may produce more people who has high academic qualification."	I_S0
"And this may beneficial to boost economy."	I_S0
"Moveover, the development of technology is also important for a society."	I_S0
"The reason is that high technology can help companies to produce some new products such as, the eletric vehicle."	I_S0
"This kind of technology products can give citizen a convenience life."	I_S0
"In conclusion, in my opinion, economic development is the priority goal in a country, but the other types of progess is important as well."	E_S0
 
"Nowadays, more and more people have owned their private cars and the number of the cars are still growing."	B_I0
"And this situation has caused a rang of problems, such as the traffic jam, especially in the developed cities."	E_I0
"While, I think there are some ways that the government can do to deal with these problems."	S_T0
"To begin with, the reason of people would like to buy cars rather than take public transports."	S_M0
"Cars are really convenient for them to travel from one place to another."	B_S0
"So many citizen will buy a car, then traffic jam is created."	I_S0
"Traffic congestion is a normal situation in many big cities, especially during the rush hour."	I_S0
"It is really a major problem, which always trouble people’ lives."	E_S0
"The first thing that the government can do is to encourage people in the city to use the public transports."	S_M0
"In this way can reduce the number of private cars."	B_S0
"But this way means that the public infrastructure must be improved and perfect, like the buses, subways, trains, and high speed rail and other transports."	I_S0
"If they are cheaper and more convenient people will use them."	E_S0
"Another approach is the government can limit the selling of cars and raising the tax level of buying a car."	S_M0
"Then people may cut down the demand of buying a car."	B_S1
"Also, if people can decrease the use of their  cars the authority possible can give these citizens some prizes, like lower taxes or a public transports card and the government will charge some money in this card."	E_S1
"In conclusion, the government can solve the problem by using these measures, I hope these ways can be useful to deal with the traffic jams."	S_C2
 
"It is true that people do not recycle enough of the household waste."	S_T1
"Although I accept that laws are useful for people to recycle their household waste, I do not agree that a legal is the only way to increase recycling that governments should take."	S_T0
"In my opinion, it is a way to solve the waste problem for a new recylcling law."	S_M1
"Governments should make it a legal obligation for households to sort their waste rather than blindly punishment."	B_S0
"Maybe goverments can develop appropriate coping strategies for households with varying degrees of waste."	I_S0
"For example, children can be taugh the konwkedges about recycling in school, households can be punished depending on the waste degree to fine ,do community service or go to jail."	I_S0
"Not only these measures can act as a deterrent, but also they have education function."	E_S0
"However, I think that the governments should do more than simply make a recycling law."	S_M1
"It might be more effective if governments put education the first."	B_S0
"For example, children could be taught about recycling in school, and their families can be informed about more environmetal impact of household waste."	I_S0
"Another way is that more regulations can be created by governments for the companies that produce the packaging for household products."	E_S0
"In conclusion, maybe we do need the legal to discipline our behavior, but this would certainly not be the only way to encourage people to dispose their waste more responsibly."	S_C2
 
"In recent decades, as high grades standing for a conscience learning attitude and an advancement in academics, great significance has been attached to the marks that school-age children get in school."	B_I0
"Consequently, many parents have developed a money-rewarding method to encourage their children to gain achievement in academic performances."	E_I0
"From my perspective, this is not a good method, because it migh cause many side effects such as bad spending habits, focusing on monetary things rather than academic issues and so on."	S_T0
"First of all, money is always related to materialism and academic is something spritual."	S_M1
"An equal can never be drawn between two different categories."	B_S0
"Encouraging the children by rewarding money for hign mark might probably led to the wrong opinion."	I_S0
"Children might think that everything in academics is money-related because this is the only motivation for them to be better involved in learing."	I_S0
"The wrong pattern will inevitably cause failure because the real reaserchers and scientists are those who have a intense interest in the fields that they are working on and money won't bring the authentic interest in learning."	E_S0
"Nevertheless, the money-rewarding pattern for school age children might cause wrong spending habits."	S_M1
"Children in that age are too naive and they have no idea how to deal with the money they have been awarded."	B_S0
"As we all know, children are not sensible and they purchase any thing they want if it is affordable."	I_S0
"Under this circumstances, many wrong choices will be made."	I_S0
"If things continue in this way, they will have a hard time changing this troublesome habit when they grow up."	I_S0
"This is absolutely what we don't want to see in the future."	E_S0
"To, summarize, the money-rewarding pattern does more harm than good, consequently it is totally avoidable, there are many other ways to encourage the children to learn better."	S_C2
 
"I sincerely do not support this idea and would advocate not adopt it for children's benefit."	S_T0
"Firt of all, the aim of education is to provide the children with abundant knowlegde to help them grow into holistic people eventually."	S_T1
"Children should develop the concept that learning is for long-term goal such as further development of intelligence instead of short-term ones including the increase of allowence."	S_T0
"Taking money as the reward of each high grade will only lead to the short sight of children and therefore cause harm to their growth."	S_T1
"That is to say, parents' offering money for each high grade of their children will not guide them into an appropriate understanding of the meaning of learning and can even contribute to obstacles on their way of pursuing further education."	S_T0
"What's more, this kind of reward may even encourage the children to get a high grade by all means, including cheating in exams and so on."	S_M2
"Children will develop a mindset that the higher mark I get, the more money I will be offered."	B_S0
"Thus, in order to get a higher payment from their parents, they will try every way regardless of whether they are permitted."	I_S0
"And that will lead to immoral behabiours of children gradually."	E_S0

"West Park Secondary School was first constructed in 1950."	B_S0
"The main building of the school was facing to the main road."	I_S0
"There was a playground behind the school building and several houses on the right side."	I_S0
"The farmland was located behind those houses and next to the playground."	I_S0
"In 1980, the farmland was changed into sports field, while those houses were removed."	I_S0
"The place of houses became car park and science block, while the latter was right next to the main building."	I_S0
"Big changes took place in 2010, the car park extended to replace the sports field."	I_S0
"However, a new sports field was built inside the playground, which shrank the playground to two thirds."	E_S0
 
"With the ever-increasing requirements of well-being and education, some people believe government should take responsibility on paying the bill for them."	S_T0
"While to the other publics, government ought to release this duty."	B_T1
"So it is a conflict that we are worth to discuss."	E_T1
"To the responsibility should pay for them, government has to consider the development of our society."	S_M1
"Based on this viewpoint, government works on this aspect can be benefit because health care is able to maintain human`s health."	B_S0
"Throughing the investment on building more hospital and researching better on medicine."	I_S0
"people can be stronger and more energitc than before."	I_S0
"Gradually in the long term, people can create more value on society as healthier human race."	I_S0
"Besides, because the education is connected with our future, government also should pay for it in order to supply more knowledgeable works on cutting-edge industry."	I_S0
"all the advantages will show in the development if government can support these via finance."	E_S0
"To personal requirement, government should not pay too much on these."	S_M1
"Because people can select their choice on these according to their own stiuation, government will cause the overwhelming waste on budget."	B_S1
"Therefore, people may believe that government don`t need to pay that."	E_S1
"To conclusion, I believe that this is gonvernment`s responsibility and should pay for these in a suitable way."	S_C2
"If government can pay for this as a kind of subsidy in terms of individual condition and pay the crucial part for his or her health and the education in the future."	S_S2
 
"Nowadays,  it is a common phenomen that some parents will offer their children some money in order to encourage kids to work hard in school."	S_I0
"Some people consider it a good idea for it can stimulate children to try their best to get a good grade in an effective way, while others are strongly against it as they contend that in this way, students will develop a bad habit."	B_T0
"From my perspective, I agree with the latter point of view and my reasons are as followed."	E_T0
"To begin with, I believe that using this way to encourage students to work hard may have some good impacts, however, the disadvantages overweigh the advantages."	S_M1
"In other words,  parents may help kids to have a better achevements in school,but they may also render them have a negative sense of moeny."	B_S0
"For instance, when my litter brother was in primary school, he did not perform well."	I_S0
"In order to change this situation, my parents decided to give him some money as the reward."	I_S0
"Although I did not think it a good idea, my brother indeed studied harder so as to win the money."	I_S0
"For a long time, I thought i made a mistake ,but later, a incident proved that I was actually right, that was when I parents stopped giving my brother money, he refused to study anymore."	I_S0
"From this experience, I learn that  providing kids money as a way to stumulate them to study is absolutely a wrong method."	E_S0
"In addition,  in my opinion, parents should teach kids the hardness of earning money rather than give children easily."	S_M1
"That is to say, many kids who never earn money by themselves may have a false illusion that it is extremely easy to make money,and it is parent's responsiblity to correct their mistakes and help them to develop the right sense of money."	B_S0
"Taking my friend Lisa as an example, when she was little, at first ,his parents would give her money when she got good grade."	I_S0
"As we were little girls who did not know the importance of money, she would spend it right away on candies, beverages and so on."	I_S0
"After her parents became aware of theri mistakes, they diceide to offer her money after she finished some housework ,so that she could feel how hard it was to earn money."	I_S0
"In this way, Lisa really began to become more careful and considerate in spending money."	I_S0
"From her story,we can safely draw a conclusion that It is better to make students understand the importance of earning money."	E_S0
"In the end, there is no denying that giving children money indeed can help kids to study harder, but I think as there are so many other ways to encourage students to work hard, we can resort to other ways to enable student to have a better performance in"	S_C2
 
"In my opinion,I confirmly agree with the statement that it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise."	B_T0
"There are three reasons to stick on my opinions."	E_T0
"First,if we want to relax ourselves,we should make our body and mind all to be free."	S_M0
"Watching a movie or reading a book is helpful to release our pressure and bring our enjoyment of art."	B_S0
"But physical exercise increases body pressure and even be harmful to humans."	I_S0
"People prefer to watch movie and read a book in a quiet place,the place is somewhere a peaceful and comfortable room."	I_S0
"People feel relax when they stay in a peaceful and comfortable place."	I_S0
"And if you want to do physical exercise,you can not calm down youself and you must be a highlighted body and mind pressure."	I_S0
"It looks no use for your relax."	E_S0
"Second,the more we watch movies and read books,the more knowledge we earn."	S_M0
"A man's life is a constan learning life."	B_S0
"We use our eyes to see books,use our ears to hear voices and movies and books are helpful for our acknoeledgement of wisdom."	I_S0
"People feel happy and relax when they earn new knowledge and new skills."	I_S0
"What makes people feel relax is they have achieved a gaol and learn somrthing new."	I_S0
"Learning knoeledge makes me feel happy and relax."	E_S0
"Third, as all people have known,comedies and joker books are famous all over the world."	S_M0
"People enjoy the actor's ridiculous performance in movies and the ridiculous chapters in books."	B_S0
"It is generally believed that when people are laughing,they will feel realx."	I_S0
"Laughing loudly can help people decrease their pressure and make them feel relax."	I_S0
"The more you laugh,the more relaxed you will be."	E_S0
"All in all,I believed in my suggestions that it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise."	B_C1
"We should relax both our body and mind instead of just releasing our pressure on mind."	E_C1
 
"According to the results of the labor-force research published recently, the following conclusions can be drawn from it."	S_I0
"In March , 1993."	S_M0
"United Stats had seven percent of their workforce which might not seen disastrous until compared with Japan, where 2.5% were unemployed."	B_S0
"However, the unemployment rate in United States began declining slowly since March 1993,and reached 5% mark in the middle of 1996."	I_S0
"Japan turned out to be less lucky, as their unemployment rate doubled in three years."	I_S0
"From then on, the percentage of unemployed workforce in United States remained roughly the same-about 5% until March 99, although there were minor falls and rises in the unemployment rate."	E_S0
"As for Japan, the percentage of unemployment fell rapidly by 0.5-0.6% after March 1996, but from summer 1996 and onwards it grew steadily and without any falls tot reach 5.0% boundary in March 1999."	B_M0
"The major conclusion that I've drawn using the graph, is that number of unemployed in USA decreased by about 2.0% in the course of six years, while in Japan it actually increased by 2.5%."	E_M0
"As a result, in March 99, both Japan and US had about 5% of their work force unemployed."	S_S2
 
"The graph has been given information on the amount of films which are being rented or sold in a particular store from 2002 to 2011."	B_T1
"there is a remarkable trend for the annual number of rentals, that has started at a peak of 175,000 in 2002,  but then gradually fell to the bottom at  67,500 in 2011."	I_T1
"It appeared that people are becoming less interested in renting films recently, instead they turn to buy films to keep at home."	E_T1
"The familiar trend could be seen in the number of VHS sales, which went from the top of 75,000 in 2002 and dropped to zero in 2006."	B_S1
"Due to the less usage of VHS type players, the decrease of the number happened."	E_S1
"The great increase of DVD sales is remarkable, which started at a number of  45,000 in 2002 and increased rapidly to 165,000 in 2004, then reached the peak of 215,000 in 2007 with a slight decrease in the next few years."	S_M2

"There are many doubt still are existing among the scholars."	B_I0
"The reasons given by lecterer why they held debated attitude toward reading passage are:
the passage argues that pterosaurs were probably cold-blooded animals as the majority of modern reptiles, however, the leturer indicated that pterosaurs needed to maintain their high body temperature for keeping flying fast and storing their energy."	E_I0
"Thus, they should be warm-blooded anamal."	S_T1
"Secondly, although pterosaurs were limited by their heavy to fly, but they could achieve that with their unusual light
sight in their eyes."	S_M1
"Their eyesight could help them keep in a low position to allow them to flip in the ground."	S_S2
"Thirdly, pterosaurs were different  from birds."	S_M1
"Birds only use their legs to gain the speed to run and jump."	B_S0

"First, charging fee for visiting museums has many benifits, the most important will be that museums and artists have a chance to make the finace from the activities and events."	S_M0
"On the other hand, the payment can be shown the appreciation to the artwork more scinerely and thoughtfully because the action of paying will motivate the visitors to try to really learn somthing from the artworks, or in other words treat the musemu tour more serisouly as it is not for free."	S_S2
"Oppositely, there are some of people who do not have a stable income may not be able to see the fancy artworks which exhibited for charging."	S_M0

"Moreover, underages and students who perhaps may get the most benifits out of visiting museums may not have enough money to pay as well."	I_S0
"Above those can be told as disadvantages that should not be ignore."	E_S0
"In my opinon, the two options of charging people for admission to museums both can be acceptable as balanced approach when adults are charge a full price as students and elderly group charge for free or charge a half price."	S_M0

"What's more, on weekends, some of children even are forced by their parents to have extal lessons like dancing, singing and painting."	I_S0
"As a result, they are eager to have relaxing time, especially the time spending with their parents."	I_S0
"If the parents are willing to accompany their children to play games or sports, children will enjor the life more, and probably they may love the world, considering the world are not full of pressure but also the good time with their parents."	I_S0
"However, if the parents spend time just to do homework with children, things get worse because the children will suffer more pressure and can;t feel any beauty of life at all."	E_S0

"But some people have the question:is garbage recycal need to be established as a law and to be managed by government?"	E_T1
"I considered that it is better to get manange by government."	S_M1
"the first of the reason is the goverment has the right to established the law to make the city better."	B_S0
"For example ,some supermarket use the plastic bags to carry the goods,but recently,the mind of recycle get into people's heart."	I_S0
"More and more market recommand to use the paper bags frequently."	I_S0
"But this is not enough."	I_S0
"sometimes you can also seearound your groud,You will see wasted plastic bags."	I_S0
"I think government should published a law that just like garbage sorting as some places like Shanghai and guangzhou."	I_S0
"If you throw your garbage everywhere you need to pay your action."	I_S0
"That make people think about themselves is that right to waste the goods?"	E_S0
"The second way is that the government can use the education sector to teach the youngers how to recycle the waste goods,and also managed the factor to recycle the waste that during the constraction."	S_M1
"You can build a sign or some signal to remind people to throw their garbage in right place."	B_S1

"Some people believe that it is more casual to do project through email."	I_T0
"However, I hold the view that people should communicate personnal when they do a project."	I_T0
"My view can be illustrated as follows."	E_T0
"First, communicating personal will help people get the real imformation and filter bias."	S_M1
"People can know about the opinion not only through the words but also the body language which sometimes express one's real thoughts."	B_S0
"With meeting face to face, people can identify whether the interview is effective or not."	I_S0
"But if people just collect the question and anwser list through email, the responser may not express their first statements and cheat in anwsering the question."	I_S0
"For example, I have ever done a project in email and spread about 100 persons."	I_S0
"The responser all said our products are good even some people did not use our products which we could clarify if we communicate with them face to face."	I_S0
"Eventually the consequense of the project is not satisfying."	E_S0
"Second, communicating personnal will help to get more imformation in limited time."	S_M1
"People can know about others opinion with particular and specific question, and the question will be answered immediatedly."	B_S0
"On the other hand, the email will be easily missed and people can not get feedbak at once."	I_S0
"For example, my friend Amy want to ask her professor about her paper topic, she write an email the professor."	I_S0
"After a week she get the feedback so that she thinks it is not effctive."	I_S0

"As distinguished from duration in other times, Internet has become a unique symbol and indispensable tool to reach our morden life,we can communicate with other people constantly."	S_T1
"But in my opinion,the nagative hands of this timeliness medium may cause effiency losing of our study or work nowadays."	S_T0
"for me ,it's undeniable that internet is powerful use to make us "morden"."	S_M1
"First,internet shorten distance between people in some perspectives which help us respond limitlessly in time and space."	B_S1
"Besides,internet offer people a whole new world of information beyond reality,it means when we need to get more information for our work and study, we must enter the world with less rules and limit."	E_S1
"So,however,the disadvantage has been revealed."	S_M1
"the limitless connect may interupt our main road to reach our goals."	B_S0
"For example,lots of sutdent can't pay attention on online network communication study because lots of information would make them to watch movies,play games and so on."	I_S0
"Moreover,Internet is unlike real world,once students or employees loaf on what they should do immediately,the goals will never finished on time."	E_S0

"this percetion will be playing an active role among kids life and being beneficial
for them whenever and wherever they will be."	I_S0

"and i will save the money."	I_S0
"everytime i saw the money, i will feel happy, so i will study more hard."	E_S0
"however,money will have no real effects on children or even bedtrimental to them."	S_M2
"as we know, children can't always keep their mind clear enough to judge one thing is good or not,so sometimes they will make wrong decision, And children might become wasting money, take my classmates Kaim as an example,for sake of gaining more money,he try to cheat his parents even if he get a low  grade"	S_S2
 
"Now a days more and more parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school, someone may think it ok, but in my opinion I don't think is a good idea."	S_T0
"Offer children money when they get good grade may ruin their valves."	S_M0
"If kids get a good mark in the school, what need parents mostly need to do is to prise them by some encourging words, to let them kown they did a great job on the study rather than just offer some money."	B_S1
"If parents offer the money, the kids may think that in the real life money is everything, so ganna have some bad influnce on the valve of kids."	E_S1

"First of all,it's because that the teachers who teach the majoy classes in a wrong way."	I_S0
"They don't know what the students need most."	I_S0
"Even though they get the hang of the majoy classes,but they have no stable way to make the students understand fully."	I_S0
"The second reason for the phenomenon is from the students self."	I_S0
"Many students go to school without goal."	I_S0
"They have on idea about their future goals which makes them live with negative thoughts on studying."	I_S0
"The last reason is from the social."	I_S0

"For example,there are so many people died from the cancer,however,most of them give up treatment because of the expensive medical cost."	I_S0
"If the curity of cancer was free to people,which means paid by goverments, the death rates of cancer could have decreased."	I_S0
"Second, the free education means that the culutivated level of population increase."	I_S0
"After a series of reaction,the increase of cultivated level will bring benefits to this country."	I_S0
"Such as the increase of GDP, Economies and the improvement of enviorment."	E_S0

"There are three reasons listed in the reading part which are against the theory of the existence of did bees."	S_T1
"But the woman in the listening part believes that those skeptics are not convincing and refutes them all with sufficient reasons."	B_S0
"First of all, it was said that there are no fossils of actual bees, but the woman believes that there are reasons for this phenomenon that those bees can not be preserved as fossils for that long, besides, the trees that can produce particular liquid called resin which can effectively preseverve insects' bodies in good condition were very rare during that period, though it is very common now."	I_S0
"So their body fossils could not be stored by neither fossils, nor resin."	I_S0
"Secondly, the woman insists that although it is a truth that modern bees are having a close relation with modern flowering plants, there are still chances that the bees once lived even though there were no flowering plants."	I_S0
"She gives us a possible explaination that before some non-flower plants evolved into those current flowering plants which have close relation with bees, did bees might feed on non-flower plants such as pin trees, etc."	I_S0
"Thridly, she believes that details for the fossilized structures are sufficient."	I_S0
"Although the fossilized chambers lack the caps that have a spiral pattern which are commonly built by modern bees in their nests, some chemical evidences still exist."	I_S0
"They are the chemical subtances left in the chamber fossils which were used to make their nests water-proof, and more importantly, the meterial that the ancient bees used is the same as the meterial used by modern bees to meet the same function and water-proof demands."	I_S0
"This chemical evidences mean that those fossilized structure were not made by other insects."	I_S0
"It were those ancient did bees that created this."	E_S0
 
"The table compares the numbers of visitors to ashdown museum before and after it was refurbished."	S_I0
"The pie charts illustrates the the results of surveys of visitor satisfaction during the same two periods."	S_T1
"It is clear that more people were willing to visited ashdown museum after refurbishment, and more visitors safitfied with their visit."	S_M2
"During the year after refurbishment, the figure for visitors was 92,000, which was 18,000 higher than the year before."	B_S0
"Turning to the results of surveys of visitors satisfaction, during the year before refurbishment, only 15% of visitors were very satisfied with their visit, while the proportion for the after refurbishment was 35%."	I_S0
"In the past, 40% of visitors were dissatisfied, which was the same figure for the satisfied visitors after rebuilding."	I_S0
"The figure for dissatisfied after rebuilding was 15%, which was 25% lower than the year before refurbishment."	I_S0
"Moreover, the figures for very dissatisfied and no response in the year before refurbishment were 10% and 5% respectively, while the figures for the yeat after were both 5%."	E_S0
 
"There have been frequent debate on the flexibility and the stability towards rules though out the history."	S_I0
"some people focus more on a fixed rules on punishment, while others think the rule needs to be more flexible  accroding to different circumustances."	B_T0
"Personally , I  think  what really matters is whether citizens are treated in the same regulations rather than some fixed rules"	E_T0
"First, it is no denying that a fixed punishments have mant strengh in many aspect, like lower management cost , easier legal training due to the public share the same regulation."	S_M1
"There are less likely to have unfair judgement as well if the criminal are punished basing on  specific rules."	B_S0
"Howerver, as I mentioned above, govornment should focus more on fair judgement  which lie behind the fixed regulation ."	I_S0
"Our socielty change rapidly , the fixed rules may not keep pace on this fast-changing world which our values change quickly."	I_S0
"A husband will be punished severvely if bullying his wife, while in acient China it seems a ordinary phenominna."	I_S0
"So only if public share a same regulations , it is enough ."	E_S0
"Second, I think a certain amount of flexibility should be allowed when making a decision on the punishment."	S_M1
"For example ,  a citizen killed a criminal when proecting himself  should not be sentenced to death ."	B_S1
"So a certain amount of flexibility in regulation will promote a more harmony society."	E_S1
"Generally ,I think both side's perspective are reasonable."	B_C1
"but I think a fixed punishment should play the main role while the other play a assitant role."	E_C1
 
"The table gives information about the proportions of mobile phone owners  using different kinds of mobile phone festures in different periods."	S_I0
"It is noticeable that the usage rate of making calls is the highest in the all kands of features."	S_M0
"Apart from this , almost all the percentage of phone owners using features except making calls had been increasing from 2006 to 2010."	S_S2
"To be more specific, the proportion of mobile phone pwners using taking photos, sending and receiving text messagese gradually went up between 2006 and 2010."	S_M0
"While those of playing games and recording video rose sharply in the meainwhile."	B_S1
"But the percentage of playing music was only 26 percent in 2010 which is the lowest proportion in all kinds of using features."	E_S1
"Overall, a huge increasing people like using mobile phone to play games and search the Internet."	S_M0
"Making calls is still the main function that people use mobile phone."	S_S2
 
"In our society now,many people are obessed by the health problems."	S_I0
"While many of us are living in the city skyscrapers, we have limited space for exercising and fitness."	S_T1
"Thus, some people think a proposal of increasing the number of sports facilities should be actively adopted, others hold the opinion that these facilities can make little change to people's health."	B_T0
"In my opinion, increasing the number of sports facilities will benefit public health in a great extend."	E_T0
"First of all, more sports facilities will provide public with more place for exercise."	S_M2
"Many people in city have the willingness to go outside for some work out, however, the little amount of sports facilities lead to spending more time on travelling to the gym,which could be a stumbling block."	B_S0
"Increasing the number of sports facilities will bring neighbors convinient condition to excersice, which will greatly increase their willing for sports."	I_S0
"In the end, contribute to a healthy body."	E_S0
"What's more, a big number of sports facilities can also provide sites for some activities that good for health."	S_C2
"The communities can hold activities for healthy purpose, and encourage community members to join the activity."	B_S1
"They do not need to be disturbed with lack of space ."	E_S1
"By promoting public welfare and holding activities, the sports facilities can improve public health easily
However, the lack of supporting facilities may be a limited for the increasing"	O
 
"The table gives us three pieces of information about subway networks in six cities— the date that the system first opened, the total number of kilometers each system has, and the number of passengers each system carries per year."	S_I0
"London has the oldest system, opened in 1863, and the most extensive network, at 394 kilometers, almost double that of the next largest network (Paris)."	S_M1
"London’ s network carries 775 million passengers per year, less than Paris and Tokyo."	B_S0
"Paris’ system was opened in 1900 and is the second largest, at 199 kilometers."	I_S0
"It also carries the second largest number of passengers— 1191 million per year."	I_S0
"Tokyo’ s network opened in 1927 and is 155 kilometers long."	I_S0
"It carries more passengers than the others— 1927 million per year."	I_S0
"That is over 50% more than Paris and 2."	I_S0
"5 times the number of passengers using London’ s system."	E_S0
"Washington DC has had a subway system since 1976."	S_M1
"It is 126 kilometers long— close to Tokyo in length, but carrying far fewer passengers— 144 million per year."	B_S0
"Kyoto has had a network since 1981."	I_S0
"It’ s the shortest of the six, at 11 kilometers, and carries the least number of people— 45 million per year."	I_S0
"The network in Los Angeles was opened in 2001, is 28 kilometers long, and carries 50 million people a year."	I_S0
"This makes it the second shortest and second lowest in terms of number of passengers."	E_S0
"Overall, it can be seen that the three oldest networks are the most extensive and carry the most passengers, whilst the systems in Kyoto and Los Angeles are particularly small."	S_C2
 
"I think it is a good idea that some parents offer their school-age childern moey for each high grade they get in school."	S_T0
"Firstly,this will encouge the childern to study harder and fouce more on study ,which could bring students with better grades."	S_T1
"Later the childern will have more confidence on study."	S_T0
"Secondly,it will give the children a sense of achivement when they get good grades and get money."	S_T1
"This can let them kown that there is no elavator to success,you have to take the stairs ."	B_T0
"If there are someting you want,you need to try to get it by yourself not others."	E_T0
"Third,parents offer money for childern when they get good grade is an essencial way to strenghen the parent-child relathionship."	S_M2
"In this way,it offers a proper oppertunerty for family members to communicate more frequently."	S_S2
"What's more,the school-age childern get their own money would made them to learn how to use the money in a right way,which would be significant when they enter the social world."	S_C2
 
"The reading passage mainly presents three surprising behaviors elephants have."	B_I0
"However, the listener disagrees with all the three ideas and thinks that they are all misunderstandings."	E_I0
"First, in the reading, it is said that elephants can be aware of approaching the end of their life when they are old and weak so that they choose to break away from the herds and find some places near the water to die."	S_M1
"This is because many of these particular sites contain only the bones of elephants."	B_S0
"However, the speaker points out that we can not assume all the elephants break away from the herds just because they know they will die."	I_S0
"The other explanation is that the old elephants' teeth are not strong so that they have difficulty chewing."	I_S0
"Therefore, they wander to the places where soft vegetables are abundant, and these places happen to be near the water."	I_S0
"So we can't conclude that they are all aware of approaching death."	E_S0
"Second, according to the reading, elephants are able to paint art works on a canvas such as flowers and themselves."	S_M1
"But the listening material holds the opposite statement that they can do the work just because of the training under the force of human."	B_S0
"Since elephants' ears are sentitive, people can strike their ears when their trunks that hold the paintbrush move away."	I_S0
"Also, they can make elephants remember the patterns of the paper."	I_S0
"So they don't have to know the patterns of flowers and themselves that are on the paper before, which means we are not sure whether they trully have the art ability."	E_S0
"Third, the passage states that elephants are afraid of small mammals that are harmless to them such as mice."	B_C0
"The experiment shows that elephants tend to avoid the mice when they are confronting them."	I_C0
"Nevertheless, according to the listening, it is not because they are fear of mice."	I_C0
"The reason is that they are not familiar with mice, and their backing bahavior is just a natural instinct."	E_C0
"In addition, the elephants in the zoo don;t react to the mice."	B_S1
"Since the mice are common in the zoo, the elephants are quite familiar to the species and don't regard them as a threat any more."	E_S1
 
"Since the growing awereness of cultueral persvervation, many people believe that history is the most crucial subject in school for the next generation, while their opponents point out that world would be completely different without the knowledge from subjects like Science and Technology."	B_T1
"In my opinion, I completely agree the view of opponents."	E_T1
"Primaryly, hisory indeed is a vital subjects."	B_S0
"Not only many successful people in today's world, but also many ancient great men have achieved their awesome jobs beacuse of a crystally clear understanding of history."	I_S0
"Hsitory helps us to avoid mistakes made by others and provides inspirations of the future."	I_S0
"It is undeniable that History is important for the young."	I_S0
"However, we definitly can not neglect other subjects, such as physics and chemistry."	I_S0
"Though we obtain ideas from history, it is still tough to turn the ideas down to reality."	I_S0
"Without scienitific subjects like physics, we can do nothing."	I_S0
"All the greatest innovations nowadays are derived from the basic concepts in sciences."	I_S0
"Scienitific subjects obviously are significant."	I_S0
"Equally importantly, scientific subject is more vital than history also because they can improve learners' logic."	I_S0
"As we know, experiments are the foundation of progresses, and experiemnts require people to predict the following steps."	I_S0
"Thus, people's logic as well as the ability to prove expriments would be fostered dramatically."	I_S0
"All in all, though history does play a crucial role in people's life, the importance of scientific subjects weigh more, as they are the methods to make concepts come ture and greatly improved logical our thinking."	E_S0
 
"Nowadays, people who are in senior management positions will have much more higher salaries than others in the same company or organisation."	S_T1
"As we all konw, not any one can be a manager in their job."	B_S0
"People who are in a important position is mainly because that he has special skills like having a strong ability of organization or having a strong ability of communicating with others."	I_S0
"Also,managers are always have more pressure than others."	I_S0
"They should not only do what should do in their job but also they should take charge in the whole company and be responseable for their workers."	I_S0
"So in my opinion,I really understand why managers always have much higher salaries than other wokers in their company."	I_S0
"And I agree with this situation."	I_S0
"Everyone owns what he has done which can make the world more fair."	I_S0
"However in sometimes things are different."	I_S0
"If managers have much higher salaries than others,people may think it's unfair for them."	I_S0
"For example,there's a small company with some workers  and some managers."	I_S0
"If managers get too much more than what he has done or other workers should have got more salaries but their manager disagree,this company are likely to face a large crisis."	I_S0
"Only when their salaries are directly connected with what they have contributed,can this difference in salaries encourage other workers work harder and learn more to increase their ability."	I_S0
"So,from what has been discussed above,we can see that if everyone in this company or organisation get what he has done for this group,it's a good and reasonable thing that managers have much higher salaries."	I_S0
"And this can also encourage others to work harder."	I_S0
"Howere,if a company gives much too less to their workers,it will disappointed their workers which will bring bad effects."	E_S0
 
"Speaking of advice about development of schools, there are always two controvercial voices."	B_I0
"One is to have more advanced facilities to get more comfortable, convenient  and various conditions of teaching."	E_I0
"Another one is to hire more teachers to teach students."	S_T1
"Personally speaking, I prefer to choose the first option."	S_T0
"Firstly, with highly advanced technology exsisting in our lives, like PPT, multiply equipments and eletronic white boards, it's convenient and comfortable for teachers to teach."	S_M0
"For instance, during the Maths class, using multiply white board to solve those moving dimentional problems is easier than just drawing different pictures of the maths problems, which also means that it's no need for teachers to draw the pictures on the black board during the class to waste time,and provide a moving scene for students to get more clearly understanding of this probelm as well."	S_S2
"Secondly, advancing the condition of facilities also be helpful for the health of those teachers and students, because with nice lights and desks, students can have a nice pose of doing homeworks or writing word instead of getting short sighted."	S_M0
"Conpared with writing under the dark environment where students can not help themselves to lower their heads to have a clear look at their books, the rate of getting short sight can be much decreased."	B_S0
"In addition, with electronic white boards, which means teachers will be no longer required to write with chalks which will cause asthma when teacher breahe a lot of the powder of chalks in."	I_S0
"Then, the health of both of teachers and students can be protected."	E_S0
"I must admitt that hiring more teachers can also offer individial tutors to every group of students, but without enough experiments and put them into actions, students could only get the ways to gain the score during the examination instead of learn the basic and practical skills which are also helpful for there job hunting in the future as the ability of putting things into actions, or they will face the problem that they can have a high academic performance to get the job, but without enough experience of experiments and practice, they can not have excellent performance in their jobs."	S_M0
"All in all, from the aspects of both health and teaching, I think it's more suitable to spend money in advancing the facilities on campus."	S_C2
 
"Life is always difficult and the hardship appears in different aspects under different backgrounds."	B_I0
"For our grandparents, people had to strive for raising several children with thin income."	E_I0
"Nowdays, we have to keep track with the high pace of the society."	S_M1
"In the past year, the food was inadequate and the salary was low."	B_S0
"In order to cultivate several children, adults had to find additional work to make up thin payment."	I_S0
"The huge pressure from living drove them to eat and wear simply."	I_S0
"I was often told tha  my grandparents merely had rice for dinner without any vegetables, let alone meat."	I_S0
"To reduce the burden of their families, our grandparents went to work earlier, some of them were even immature."	I_S0
"When they received money, they did nothing but to make an informed arrangement on how to spend it."	I_S0
"For example, the daily necessities, the electronic bill, phone bill and the tuition of younger kids were all needed to be taken into acconut."	I_S0
"That is why they seldom bought  themselves new clothes and had some entertainment."	E_S0
"Furthermore, in most families, the younger children had to wear the clothes from their brothers and sisters only because they could not afford the new ones."	S_M1
"At that time, grandparents had no choices but to squeeze the expense every day for the preparation for the new year."	B_S0
"It was their effort that resulted in our relative happier life today."	I_S0
"However, nowdays we also have to face infinite stress from the highly developed society."	E_S0
"Admittedly, we are not that poor as our grandparents, yet tghe diffculties of our age never fade next to theirs."	B_C0
"Actually, the fierce competition provides us with narrowchance to escape but to work hard, even harder than our           grandparents."	I_C0
"In spite of the pressure physically, we are confronted with the mental problems."	E_C0
"Children have to bear the constant expectation from their parents and school and th"	O
 
"Thesedays,with people earn a higher salary,people's living standard have also been improved."	S_T1
"But the quickening tempo of modern lifestyle also contrubutes partly to increasing rubbish problem."	B_S0
"Garbage bring a lot of bad effects."	I_S0
"such as attracts vermin,polluts waterways and causes fire hazard."	I_S0
"In om opinion, I think,there are some reason for those phenomenon."	I_S0
"Firstly,many advertisenent and consumer culture encourage people to spend,such as some billboard,poster and flyer on the street or many commercial on the TV."	I_S0
"After that,disposable packaging become fashionable,which is made from non-degradable substance."	I_S0
"Because many people prefer takeaway fast food and use of disposable items for the convenience,such as milk cartons and burger wrappers."	I_S0
"At last, we lack adequate facilities to dispose various of waste，for example, not many dustbins are seen on the street."	I_S0
"But I also agree with the view that those prombles could be taken to solved."	I_S0
"Our government should take stronger and hasher measures to combat the littering behaviors and raise people's environment awareness."	I_S0
"At the same time ,the rubbish should be classifically so that the procedure can achieve high efficiency."	I_S0
"Besides,people shoule learn recycle."	I_S0
"For instance,reuse some shopping bags instead of plastic bags."	I_S0
"For companies,which should introduce some environment-friendly products and minimally packaged goods should be encouraged."	I_S0
"In conclusion ,reducing waste accumulation are really importent and it is beneficial to the sustainable development."	I_S0
"Certainly nobody wants to see our resources used up and our environment is full of garbages."	E_S0
 
"I agree that parents should let children make mistakes and learn something from mistakes."	S_T0
"In China, when a kid makes mistake, his parents often choose to beat him instead of telling him what he has done."	B_T1
"This is not a valid way to educate kids, quite the reverse, it makes children hate their parents."	E_T1
"As parents, they are responsible to educate their children."	B_S0
"When children make mistakes, it means that they are not good at some aspects, they are not qualified to accomplish the task."	I_S0
"Therefore, they have to learn some experience from mistakes so that they can finish the problem perfectly next time."	I_S0
"This is also a sort of education for children."	I_S0
"In this part,parents play an extremely important role."	E_S0
"Children are young, they sometimes do not understand right or wrong."	S_M2
"Likewise, they are not able to learn and prevent mistakes independently."	B_S0
"In order to help them and lead them to do better next time after a mistake has been made, parents are necessary to teach them."	I_S0
"When I was young, I made a big mistake that I ran to a place without a penny which was really far from my home, my parents knew this from neiborhood and were worried, they looked for me for an afternoon."	I_S0
"After we were home, they did not beat me."	I_S0
"Instead, they talked to me about the danger of running out alone, they asked me to stand in their shoes, which left a great impression in my mind."	I_S0
"I knew I had done something wrong, I had to correct it and learn the danger of getting out of home alone."	E_S0
"In the examplary true experience of mine above, I want to state that it is very necessary for parents to let kids make mistakes because it is efficient and feasible to engrave the experience and what parents want kids to know in their minds."	S_C2
 
"To start a business by oneself is becoming popular, so that less people tend to be a worker in other's coporation."	B_T0
"There are some reasons why this type of job can extremely attract public."	E_T0
"To commence with, people are more and more willing to work with freedom rather than under the supervision of others, they feel pressured."	S_M1
"For instance, when someone lates for work, his salary can be reduced."	B_S0
"They feel that they have limited and restricted time, and sometimes the workload is also unreasonable."	I_S0
"What is more, in the present age, youth has more novel ideas due to the developing technology which can help young people get something easily."	E_S0
"However, this choice has its own weaknesses."	S_M1
"As a self-employed person, there is no guarantee that they will get a stable income, as they are paid with their performances."	B_S0
"While as a business owner, it is obvious that there are a lot of risks for them such as the bank loan, the break of the company..."	I_S0
"On the other hand, the beginning of the innocation is very hard that owner has to deal with many problems by himself, therefore, he needs to stay up during that period."	I_S0
"It is harmful to his health that irregular work and rest bring many illness even the serious disease."	E_S0
"To sum up, I think the self-employment has both benefits and drawbacks in equal measure."	S_C2
"These worker need much energy and certain economi"	O
 
"Nowadays, many people agree that the senior leadership in the same company or organisation should earn higer salaries than other worker."	S_T0
"In my opinion,it is of course a good thing."	S_T1
"Firstly,there is a tendency for those senior leaders to take responsibilities and they need to pay more times on their studys or programs."	B_S0
"If some problems happened,they should learn abour them quickly and make some important decisions."	I_S0
"And then, they should lead their team to solve the problem and achieve the goal."	I_S0
"Therefore, compare with other usual workers, they deserve the higher salaries."	I_S0
"Secondly, there is no double that a person's salary depends on his ability and experience."	I_S0
"When they reach the senior management of the company or organisation, it is showed that they have stronger ability and rich experience."	I_S0
"And also, the higher salaries would be an incentive for employees to work harder and excel in their work."	I_S0
"Some people argue that people's salary should not be decided by his position and whether he is a leader."	I_S0
"But in most companies and organisations, I think that a person's postion is an important index to evaluate his ability and what he has contributed to his company."	I_S0
"In general, I think it is a good desicion for those companies and organisations to give senior management higher pay."	I_S0
"Those people are braces of their company and organisation."	I_S0
"Without them, it is harmful for company to develop itself."	I_S0
"As a person's position is relevant to his skill, experience and responsibility, it is reasonable that at higher positions are paid more than those of usual positions."	E_S0
 
"Nowadays, more and more people learn foreign languages."	S_I0
"They may learn English or Japanese, like me, I learned Portuguese."	B_T1
"People don't seem content with speaking only one language."	I_T1
"From this, two points of view have emerged."	E_T1
"One the one hand, people learn foreign language only for travel and work."	S_M1
"Indeed, due to the development of transportation, people like to go to more places to see different scenery, and travel to other countries, the language is a big problem."	B_S0
"People learn the local language and communicate fluently with the locals."	I_S0
"If they think place is comfortable and want to work here in the future, language is also an important work skill."	I_S0
"But I think that this view is that one-sided."	I_S0
"People do not necessarily learn foreign language just to go abroad."	I_S0
"Now international exchanges are becoming more and more frequent."	I_S0
"There are also many foreigners in our country."	I_S0
"They may not speak Chinese, and then people who with foreign languages have an advantage."	E_S0
"The shortcomings in this view lead to another aspect: learning foreign languages is more than these reasons."	S_M1
"In my opinion, this view is correct."	B_S0
"Of course, there are many reasons for learning a foreign language."	I_S0
"For me, my university major is Portuguese."	I_S0
"The reason for learning this is that in our country,this is still a language that is not well known, but in fact, Portuguese is very unique with its pronunciation, its grammar, etc."	I_S0
"At the same time, through it, I also learned about Portugal and Portuguese culture that I had never been familiar with before, which is a suitable reason for learning languages."	E_S0
"In short, learning a foreign language is an excellent method for us to expand our horizons to see the world."	B_C1
"No matter what the reason is, learning more is always right."	E_C1
 
"The table describes numbers of four tyes of new homes built in a special section durign the period from 1999 to 2000."	S_T0
"It is noticeable that detached house was the dominat kind of accommodation with an upward tendency  in this place during the period."	B_S0
"It maintained satable in 2000 in 2000 and 2001 after increasing from 1800 in 1999, and then in 2002 it rose to nearly 2400."	I_S0
"Being smilar with the trend of detached house, there was an increasing mumber of terrace house during that time."	I_S0
"However, the amount of terrace house was just half of detached house in each year."	I_S0
"By contrast, defferent with detached house and terrace house, a decline can be seen in the building of flat and semi-detached."	I_S0
"Flat was less popular than semi-detached and the number declined quicker than semi-detached."	I_S0
"Overall, detached was the most popular among people in the region, while terrace house was attratless."	I_S0
"Both of them increased."	E_S0

"Besides,a large part of students were not learn any kind of language which is  take over 20 percentage."	I_S0
"About 15 percent students can use French and the same proportions of them can speak other diverse language."	I_S0

"In 2010,Spanish was still the largest language in those record(35%)."	I_S0
"In addition,data of learning other languages also has increased."	I_S0
"In general ,only students who can spesk English has less than 2000."	I_S0
"In conclusion, more students master the second language in 2010."	E_S0

"The changing wave between America and Sweden is almost the same before 2000."	B_S1
"After that the situation changed: there come a outbreak in Sweden in 2010 while America still kept calm."	E_S1

"Playing game like basketball or football can effectively slove such a problem."	I_S0
"These kind of team sports can make children feel that they are closely related to parents and enhance their relationship."	I_S0

"To illustrate, many young people are prone to surf the web and scan other's comments to determine an essence of affair."	I_S0
"In fact, these approach is not reasonale because people will accept extremely narrow information, and could not figure out the truth."	I_S0
"Consequently, it is impossible for these poeple to be knowledgeable."	E_S0
"Adimittedly, it is true that if people are preoccupied with simple one source, they will pay more attention and only focus on it."	S_M0
"Therefore, they can get a deep insight of this."	B_S1
"However, it is likely that the source is not really right or true, so people who fouces on this will go astray way to reaching the ultimate outcome."	E_S1
"To put all into a nutshell, I strongly believe that it is nucessary for people to get information from different new sources because it can broaden their horizon"	S_C2

"And the overall trend has been upward,with only small fluctuations from 1980 to 1990."	B_S0
"Besides, Coalconsumption has been rising slightly all time and has been stable for a period between 1995 and 2005."	I_S0
"And after a small decline,natural gas showed an upward trend for around 30 years ,and then recovered to be stable in 2015 at 25."	E_S0
"After that , there are also three types of energy that consistenty use less than10 quadrillion units which are nuclear, solar and hydropower."	S_M0
"They  have been stay in the same level with only a gradual fluctuation."	B_S1
"And they had the same amount of consumption until 1995."	E_S1
"Overall , the consumption of petrol oil coal and natural gas has always be huge, and it is increasing year by year ."	S_M0
"By contrast  nuclear , solar , wind and hydropower are not taken seriously by people, therefore the consumption has been very low and has not changed much all time."	S_S2
 
"In terms of the publishments, this topic has been talking for many years, some people suggest that it should be given a clear and confirmed punishment to every type of crime."	S_I0
"While, a different voice claims that, deciding on the punishment, we should consider that different condotions of each crime and the intention to committing it."	S_T1
"For one thing, we need to make a regulation of punishment, a fixed one can work well to avoid people to break it."	S_M0
"Once a person obeies this rule, he should be punished, no matter who he is, no matter why he did that."	B_S0
"For example, a poor college student wanted to make money to support his tuition next year, then he planned to work in a restaurant in the spring festival."	I_S0
"While, one day, a customer have dinner in that restanrant, the student was so jealous of her silk-stocking clothes, and her costly bag, he guessed this lady must very rich, when she went to the bathroom, the student stole her purse."	I_S0
"This can not be tolerant, he was an adult already, so he must be punished."	E_S0
"However, in some areas, like countrysides, some punishments may not be carried out as the law."	S_M0
"People will take many factors into consideration, such as the purpose, the circumstances and also the social status and so on."	B_S1
"For instance, a son of one polician, once he commits crime, his father will feel shamed and then, their family will take every effort to reduce his crime."	E_S1
"I support the former one."	S_M0
"As far as I am concerned that, this is a effective way to curd people from commiting crimes."	B_S1
"If we perform this way, then, when some one want to break some law, they would know that they have no excuse and no backway, at last, they may give their ideas."	E_S1
"To sum up, the rules of the law are very significant for our society, everyone should obey and respect them."	B_C1
"Then we can live a safe and happy life together."	E_C1
 
"I totally agree with the statement."	B_T0
"Doing physical exercise will makes me even more tired."	E_T0
"Instead, Watching movies is the best way to relax, which I have been concern for years."	S_T1
"Firstly, movies are entertaining product, which it meant to entertain the audience."	S_M0
"The only thing I need to do while enjoying a movie, is sitting on my sofa."	B_S0
"In my opinion, watching movie is the easiest thing in this world."	I_S0
"With technology developing, I don't even need to use my mouse to do the clicking, instead, I have remote control by my voice."	I_S0
"Imagine that after I have been studying for so long, and for so hard, then I sit on the sofa, and command to my phone, wich connected with my computer already."	I_S0
"I don't even need to unlock my iPhone, instead, I just yell loudly, "Hey, Siri!"	I_S0
"Play Batman vs. Superman!""	I_S0
"How entertaining, and how fast it could be done!"	E_S0
"Secondly, I am always tired about things that are out of my control, but movie won't do it in anyway."	S_M0
"Driving a car on the road can make me tired becasue there are rules to obey, traffic lights to watch, and bikes to avoid."	B_S0
"However, in the movie world, if I am not happy about what I am watching, I can just simpley shut it down."	I_S0
"Many people talk about horror movies, they say this genre movie makes them mentally tired."	I_S0
"I would like to say that, if I don't want the scary sence, I could skip the part."	I_S0
"Things that could be controlled in my hand, makes me relax."	E_S0
"Thirdly, watching a movie is a spritual tour, that makes me forgetting troubles."	S_M0
"Just like doing drugs, like marijuana, after I got high, I don't care about the bills to pay, F grades, girlfriend had sex with others, etc."	B_S1
"I can concentrate on the movie, and put all the rest of the things away, out of the screen."	E_S1

"Nowadays, as the pandemic has happened all over the world, more and more people show great concern about health."	B_I0
"There has been a debate based on the methods that can improve public health."	E_I0
"Some people think increasing the facilities of exercise in the community can be the best method, while others hold a different view, claming that it is not effective at all and there should be other approach to build public health."	B_T0
"From my own perspective, I am in favour of the latter view."	E_T0
"Initially, setting up some equipments for people to play sports stimulates people in a community to do more exercises."	S_M0
"As there are many people hang out in their community in the evening, they would rather chat with their neighbors or take a walk, if there are some sports equipments to play, they can definitely enjoy them."	B_S1
"Besides, since the number of facilities is increasing, meaning that each community will have more equipments, people can be more convenient to do that instead of going to the gym that may be far from one's home."	E_S1
"Nevertheless, the increasing number of sports equipments does not benefit people's health somehow."	S_M0
"For instance, if an individual does not know the correct instruction to use it, consequently, the facilities do not make any sense."	B_S0
"Also, people can keep fit by keep up other living habits such as keep a regular healthy diet."	I_S0
"For instance, in the modern society, it is hard for people to get enough sleep and eat healthy food."	I_S0
"So these are required to improve the public health as well."	E_S0
"Otherwise, the public facilities may require costs on fixing and cleaning them periodically."	S_M0
"An infected person, as an example, spreading the virus by using a public facility, these may make more people getting involved to it."	B_S1
"This is quite tough for the government to control."	E_S1
"In conclusion, I do not agree that establishing more public facilities is the best approach to improve people's health as other implements are also required."	S_C2
 
"Nowadays, an interesting discussion has arisen among the public: whether people today are more willing to help the strangers in struggled field."	S_I0
"Many people indicate that with the development of society people is more warmhearted and glad to assist people."	B_T1
"However, from my perspective, I disagree with this idea."	I_T1
"Here are the reasons I will explain."	E_T1
"Firstly, people today become more careful and self-protected, which means that it is less possible for people to help strangers."	S_M0
"As is known to all, there are continuous reports in our daily newspapers, complaining the thickers and cheaters who used different methods to deceive nice people and stole their money."	B_S0
"For example, I remember that when I was a kid walking on the street with my father, my father was deceived by a strangers, who told my father that he had not eaten for a long time."	I_S0
"Then my father opened his pocket and rendered five dollars for him."	I_S0
"However, when we returned, we met this stranger again, who still asked other walkers for money."	I_S0
"Since then, my father never believed the strangers many more."	I_S0
"So it happened on many other people."	I_S0
"Because of the deceiving behavior, today people are seldem willing to provide help for strangers."	E_S0
"Secondly, people today are under a huge pressure in working, resulting in less chance to focus on the struggling people."	S_M0
"It is universally acknowledged that the development of technology and economy has burdened many people to spare no effort to work for a living."	B_S0
"And this situation accounts for a less attention to others, like the struggling people."	I_S0
"It has been reported that, nowadays people have to work for at least ten hours a day, compared with eight hours a day in the pass."	I_S0
"So it is undeniabe that people will have time to pay attention to the strangers."	I_S0
"For example, in the subway, many employees will bury their heads in cellphones and laptops to read the massages from their boss."	E_S0
"Admittedly, people still maintain a willing for helping weakers, which might be a natural behaivor for humanbeings."	S_M0
"However, with the development of society, this behavior could be more justified, engaged by the government."	B_S0
"Many countries have rules and norms designed for assisting poor people."	I_S0
"So, nowadays people do not have to be worried about the struggling stranges."	E_S0
"Taking everything into account, I interpret that many people are not willing to help struggling people."	B_C1
"But it does not mean people todays are lack of mercy."	E_C1
 
"Some stedent take one year travel or to work is a hot-button issue
this behavior draws praise but stirs suspicion ."	B_I0
"I tend to believe than,student should try to in order to travel or to work because students living in the university campus will be able to get plenty of opportunites to communicate with different people,such as their roommates classmates and tutors"	E_I0
"One obvious advantage for students going to university is that student in university may contribute to nhancing the students communicative abilities."	S_M2
"Admittedlly,some students dont know how to protect themselves and"	O
 
"In mu opinion I think do some exercise is better than watching movie and reading book,cause do some exercise it's good for our healthy also we can find more friends also we can contact outside."	S_T0
"We need do more exercise rather than just watching movie for fun."	S_M0
"In the American almost people use exercise way to remission pressure a lots of people choose do some exercise after working."	B_S0
"If we choose relax by watching movie will let yourself more fat and more negative as you know if you don't do some exercise your body will be very fat, long time later you will admire others muscle and you will become self-abasement and befraid of do some intercation with others."	I_S0
"So we need choose a  best way to relax ourselves rather than choose a comfortable way to relax."	E_S0
"In China has a very famous actor is YuYan Peng when he was young he is a really fat boy,leg him be afraid of to face others."	S_M0
"When he became do exercise accorading his hard training now he his a pretty good body."	B_S0
"What ever may betide he still went to gym may be work very late or has a bad weather."	I_S0
"No thing can stop he do exercise."	I_S0
"He said he likes excercise this is a part of life in his life."	I_S0
"Also go to gym can let people become possitive."	E_S0
"We know wrok or study let us very tired we need find a easy way to relax ourselves,although watching movie let us comfortable."	S_M0
"We just can choose sometimes to do that,in nomally life we need choose do exercise to relax ourselves."	B_S1
"Also we know watching movie for along time is bad for our healthy why not choose a good way to relax ourseleves."	E_S1
"Finally I want to said we reading or watching movie can let us learn something but healthy and good body it's the most important in our life so do more exercise just can good for you."	S_C2
 
"Nowdays, with the qulckly development of technology and economy,people gradually increase their purchase not only in quality but also in quatity."	S_T1
"As for TV Channels, some people think more TV Channels means more choice."	B_S0
"Others thinks the increasing number of it would result a decreasing quatity of TV Channels."	I_S0
"As far as I am concerned, TV channels can be more diverse and keep its quatity with our effect."	I_S0
"In one way,people prefer more different choices to satisfy their different needs."	I_S0
"For example,there is a TV in a house which has five members:grandparents,parents and a lovely child."	I_S0
"If there are more TV channels,grandparents can enjoy the programs which can preserve their health;mother can appreciate the shopping program and the TV drama;father can learn about the finance programs and the sports programs;child can watch the cartoon to get fun."	I_S0
"So,more TV channels benefit more people in satisfying their needs."	I_S0
"However, there are other kind of person who hold a distinct view."	I_S0
"They indicate that more TV channels may lead to the decrease of TV programs quatity."	I_S0
"What they worry about is definitely reasonable for nowdays there comes a phenomenon that some producers produce a bad TV show quickly with a bad repution in order to get more benifit in a short time."	I_S0
"But in my opinion,it is siginificant if our country wants to improve our TV programs situations."	I_S0
"We now have found the problem that some poor TV programs has been made."	I_S0
"What we can do now is against it and improve it instead of avoiding it."	I_S0
"This means diverse TV channels is not the reason for the problem but the society value and incomplete law give loopholes for these businessman to avail."	I_S0
"In one word,we need more time and more complete law to develop our TV field."	I_S0
"In this way,we can gradually solve the problem of the low quatity of TV programs and bring to audience a diverse and high quatity TV channels."	E_S0

"In these days,many young students are leaving schools with negative thoughts on studing."	S_T0
"That's a really bad phenomenon ."	B_S0
"And the reasons for that are vateries."	I_S0
"First of all, we should know the view that studing should never be stopped."	I_S0
"But the benefit from studying can't be seen right now."	I_S0
"However, when young people rapidly want to get to the good fare from studying , they will be upset."	I_S0
"So they became to lose the interests on studying."	I_S0
"And however, techelogy developing gives young people a lot of dividing."	I_S0
"They will prefer playing computer games or just suring in the Internet than studying."	I_S0
"Watching TV sounds more comfortable than reading a math book."	I_S0
"In many young peoples' minds, studying means wasting time and stupid."	I_S0
"When friends are talking together, they would like to laugh at the guy who is hard in learning."	I_S0
"In this situation, more young person give up to be a different guy from his friends."	I_S0
"And however, the negative thoughts on studying will damage the whole socioty , so we should improve the situation and don't negelect the phenomenon."	I_S0
"As a college student, i suggest schools should open more intereting activities about studing to encourage the young person."	I_S0
"And we should let the young person konw the importance of studying."	I_S0
"Studying is not only for families or teachers, but also for themselves."	I_S0
"The interests in studying should be the best teacher for everyone."	I_S0
"So what we should do is in metal to change the negative thoughts."	I_S0
"I believe if young people realize the importance of studying, the thougts will be changed and the phenomenon will be improved."	E_S0
 
"With the development of technology and the introduction of Internet."	B_I0
"People are connected together closer than ever."	I_I0
"They are able to learn different culture and language to widen their view of the world."	I_I0
"Nowadays, it is becoming a fashion that parents let their childeren learn one or two foreign language for their future development and the learning are starting earlier and earlier."	I_I0
"Some children are learning a foreign language at primary school rather that secondary school."	I_I0
"In my opinion, learning a foreign language in primary school has much more disadvandages than the advantages."	E_I0
"The reasons are as follows:"	S_S2
"First, children are starting to learn their first language( native language) in primary school."	S_M0
"Learning two language at the same time is very confusing and difficult."	B_S0
"Children might be confused and mixed them up and not able to tell the difference."	I_S0
"For example, if a child learn Chinese and English at the same time, he or she might not tell the difference and even put some Chinese word when speaking English."	I_S0
"That's not helpful for his or her future study."	E_S0
"Second, it is hard for them to learn their country's culture as well."	S_M0
"Learning a language is equal to learning a culture."	B_S0
"If children don't learn their native language carefully, it is hard for them to learn their culture."	I_S0
"Kids grow in this environment is not likely to have feelings as strong as kids learn their own language first for their country."	E_S0
"Even though learning a different language when they are little means that they can speak it more fluently."	S_M0
"It is not worth to make children have difficulty in their future study and forget their identity."	S_S2
"That's why I don't recommand learning a different language at such a young age."	S_C2
 
"I support the idea that kids should be taught to distinguish between right and wrong when they are young."	B_T1
"And in the progress, the parents or teachers need punitive methods but not just punishment."	E_T1
"Admittedly, some people believe that punishment should be forbid."	S_M2
"Altough this view is true to some extent, it is over-thinking the consciousness of the kids."	B_S0
"For those young children, sometimes they can hardly realize that they are doing something with bad influence."	I_S0
"For example, some little children may be fond of playing with fire, ignoring the danger of it."	I_S0
"If we just tell them to get away from the fire, they may obey it at that time but forget all of what you say hours after then."	I_S0
"Although there are some alternative ways, punishment can be the most effective."	I_S0
"That's why we cannot deny the necessity of punishment."	E_S0

"When it comes to whether the museum should be free to enter,people often have different views."	S_T1
"some people may think it could cause museums become crowded,noisy and difficult to manage, but in my opinion, it is necessary to ensuer museums are free for all the people ."	B_S0
"It is universally acknowledged that museums are public places showing precious cultural relics."	I_S0
"one of the most imporant functions is to eduate people,which may need more peaceful and cleaner environment rather tan noisy crowd."	I_S0
"Besides if people are allowed to visit free of charge there will be more visitors and museums will even be overflowing with folks which could cause some demeges in museums and be hard to recover these demeges."	I_S0
"Maybe even here are many uncivilized behaviors."	I_S0
"However, i think we could not take away  the right of those people who might struggle to pay for the tickets to the museums."	I_S0
"Everyone should have the right to visit  museums free of charge , because it is of great significance to let all the people kown the glorious history and hard work of their ancestors ."	I_S0
"Besides the cost which ensures the normal operation of the museum comes from all the citizens, we should not deny the efforts of those who may live in poverty ."	I_S0
"In conclusion , it seems to me that it is very important to ensure the free charge of museums admission , onyl by keeping this system can all the people in the country know well about their ancestors' history and maintain these good qualities."	E_S0

"Females are different compares to males, they tend to get more top grades in Language and Humanity."	B_T1
"They tend to have lower points in the other proportions ,but not all three proportions are lower than males in the same enviroment."	E_T1
"First,as we can see,the males in the S school get lower top grades in language and humanity,compared with females in the same school as well as males in the nation,which seems to tell us that males in the S school are not good at Language and Humanity."	B_M1
"Second,when we campare females grades in this school with males in the same school and females data in national,we can find that females in this S school get less top grade than males in the same school in math and science,and more top grades in the art ,language and humanity."	E_M1
"When compare to females inn national ,the result seems similair,which might tell that they are poor in math and science."	S_S2
"To sum up,the males get less top grades than females in the S school."	S_C2
"Males have lower level of Language and Humanity,and higher level in math and science,females in the S school go to the opposite."	S_S2
 
"In the reading material, the auther claims that solar energy is the one of the most promising energy."	S_I0
"The professor, however, constradicts this view for the following reasons."	S_T0
"Firstly, despite the statement in the reading material that solar energy does not harm the environment, the professoer contends that the solar enerfy is not perfect."	S_M1
"The solar light is non pulluted."	B_S0
"However, the solar panels are not."	I_S0
"The solar panels consist of many harmful element which will pullute the envieonment."	I_S0
"Also, the element can spared to atmosphere  which is harmful."	E_S0
"Secondly, the reading material indicates that solar energy is an inexhaustible source of energy."	S_M1
"By contrast, in accordance with the professor, this claim does not hold water."	B_S0
"It is on the ground that the usage of solar energy are limitted."	I_S0
"For example, the solar panels in the professor's house are only use to heat water."	I_S0
"besides, it is less efficiency."	E_S0
"Finally, the reading material points out that solar energy can be used from virtually anywhere on the planet,  yet the professor asserts that the traditional energy are convient."	B_C1
"Because the cover of the panel take a large range which is impossible."	E_C1
"The example shows that the US need panel cover 100 meter mult 100 meter squire to support which is bigger then a state."	B_S0
"Also the panel are complicated."	I_S0
"When it broken we are improsbile to fix it by ourselves."	E_S0
 
"As the modern  technology develops,there are more people to give concentration on their health."	S_I0
"Some people think the government should  increase the number of sports facilities."	B_T1
"Whehterelse,some others think it is more effective to improve other required measures than pubulic health."	I_T1
"As far as I am concerned,the best way is the later."	E_T1
"In our daily life,there are many public facilities everywhere."	S_M2
"For example,in our nieghbour,shool and square."	B_S0
"However,a few people would keep exercise everyday."	I_S0
"In addition,some pepole even to destruct public facilities."	I_S0
"However,as the people's life have become better than before."	I_S0
"A lot of health clubs appear in our life,like dance clue,gyms and so on."	I_S0
"People can depend on their interests to chose which clubs they prefer."	I_S0
"On the other hand,people can also do excercise in their home by instructions,coming from some sports application in their phones."	E_S0
 
"Recently, an interesting question has been attached much concern to: whether should people do charity work by putting money in charitable organizations or give the people in need of their own?"	B_S0
"Answers vary from one person to another."	I_S0
"Some people claim that people should decide their money where to go and consider who are the people most in need by themselves while others oppose the idea."	I_S0
"To my way of thinking."	I_S0
"I tend to agree with the latter."	I_S0
"My viewpoint is based on the following reasons."	E_S0
"To begin with, it is more reliable to put money into an organization since they have more experience on how to put the money or give for whom."	S_M2
"Most importantly, a big organization is more unlikely to cheat."	B_S0
"Take a famous new as an example, there were usually some homeless people on the street that putting a bowl to get money from the people past several years ago in China."	I_S0
"But what is food for thought is that some of those people are  even richer than the people give money to them and some of disable people are actually fake, which means they pretend to be a  "	E_S0
 
"It's argued that there are a good thing for that higher salaries should be given to high-grade management positions rather than oher worker in the same company or organization."	S_T1
"I completely agree with this view."	B_S0
"On the one hand, I accept the idea that senior manager get a high salary,because they cost much more toll in their study and then acquire high-level certification in university."	I_S0
"In a certain extent it can verify they have known more knowledge than worker who awalys working for a hard and very dangerous occupation."	I_S0
"while the manager use their brain and knowledge to solve some difficult problem for their company."	I_S0
"take me for example before I  worked in sumsung for IT soft management position ,i just a saller in a small furniture company I even can't  afford my rent,but i didn't make much more profits for my company than latter."	I_S0
"On the other hand,I think the worker just do something that everyone who are strong are able to."	I_S0
"it is show fair in social class."	I_S0
"if you could  do more for you company than other,you could earn more money."	I_S0
"Not only wii it impose people to learn more knowledge for themself  but they also will to educate generation to study hard from they are a child."	I_S0
"it is a good thing for social and individuals."	I_S0
"To conclude it seems to me that it is a good thing for senior management positions to have much higher salaries because of this it just a reflection of social fair."	I_S0
"In certain extent it is very benefit for society."	E_S0
 
"Now, some students would like to take one year off between finishing school and going to university, in order to travel or to work."	S_T1
"But is it really good to their future?"	B_S0
"First of all, why we need to go to school and study?"	I_S0
"Maybe some students were taught to learn well in order to have a good future."	I_S0
"However, the actual situation is that everyone is different, someone good at study, the others are not."	I_S0

"So, in my opinons, this kind of teaching method is totally wrong, which will lead to unchangeable sense of wrong value in the whloe life of the children."	E_S0
"Based on what i've said, i think iis wise to find another way to teach children."	S_C2

"Although knowledge is still make sense,young students completely get if from Internet and learn it by theirselves."	I_S0
"Schools is no longer the only way that young students can study what they want to know."	I_S0
"What's more,the huge competion among so many students makes them lose their heart in studying."	I_S0
"As we all know,there are too many bachelors graduated every years to find them jods."	I_S0
"Studying hard in school gradually become a little part of someone's ability factor."	I_S0
"And someone who was borned in a rich family,will easiler get the chance."	I_S0
"So it is no werid that young students get negative thoughts on studying and choose to drop out of school."	I_S0
"In my opinion,improving teaching level and enrich course content is the most useful way to attrct students come back to school."	I_S0
"Only schools and teachers can teach students something can not be found in Internet,will make students know the importance of studying at school."	I_S0
"No one is willing to stay in a boring class."	I_S0
"From what has been discussed above,we may safely arrive at the conclusion that the inprovement of Internet and huge competion make young students have negative thoughts on studing."	I_S0
"Teaching level is the key to keep them."	E_S0
 
"Both in the passage and the lecture are discussing the ways to address the decline of Torreya, a kind of ever-green tree in the states of Florida."	B_I0
"The author describes three solutions to save this plant species, while the lecturer doubts the passage by stating that none of the three ways will work."	E_I0
"To begin with, the professor points out that the first option mentioned in the passage, reestablishing Torreya, will not succeed."	S_M0
"Why?"	B_S0
"Because many areas within Florida's microclimate region  are turning drier for either global warming or the disappearing wetlands resulted from the drainage."	I_S0
"Consequently, this region failed to meet the condition Torreya needs to survive."	E_S0
"Additionally, the professor claims that the second option, relocating Torreya, will definitely result in vain."	S_M0
"To illustrate this argument, the professor gives an example of another tree, the black locust tree, which was moved to a new environment and them quickly spread to kill off other plants species, including some already endangered ones."	B_S1
"By this example, the professor points out the disastrous consequence and opposes the second method raised in the reading passage."	E_S1
"Finally, the professor argues against the third option in the reading, preserving Torreya in research centers."	S_M0
"The population of Torreya, she explains, has to be genetically diverse in order to resisit diseases."	B_S1
"Nevertheless, research centers, different from the wild, are not capable of maintaining such a size."	E_S1
"For all the above analysis, the solutions in the reading lose their values."	S_C2
 
"The writing claims that  sending humans to Mars is kind of impossible as for some reasons while the listening part goes against it with a lot of solvements."	S_I0
"The discussions are as follows."	S_T1
"What comes first is the problem of taking necessity for life such as water, food and oxygen."	S_M0
"The article maintains that the spaceship limits the place of boarding them."	B_S0
"However, the woman in the tape conflicts it with a high-tech instrument called Hydro-ponike."	I_S0
"It is great that this equipment occupies littel space while it can rotate dirty water into fresh water."	I_S0
"There is also some plants in it so that it  is able to change carbon dioxide into oxygen."	I_S0
"In that case, astronauts have no concerns about daily things."	E_S0
"The second prblem, as the article points out, is the zero- gravity environment."	S_M0
"Astronauts may easily get sick when exposed in the zero-gravity space for a long time."	B_S0
"But this problem can also be solved."	I_S0
"The professor demonstrates that astronaut can overcome difficulties by training in a special instrument and the regular statement in the zero-gravity environment gives them adoption in the future space environment."	E_S0
"The last but not the least, the writing indicates that being exposed to dangerous levels of space radiation does really bad to astronauts."	S_M0

"As social develops, young people's life increasingly become complex due to a variety of aspects of their life."	S_I0
"Some think that it is fundamental to be able to plan and organize, while others think that it is not essential."	S_T0
"As far as I am concerned, I prefer the former."	S_T1
"First of all, the people who have the ability  to plan and organize seldom miss important work."	S_M1
"Because in the modern life, people face huge works and they cannot aware all of vital things without a comprehensive schedule, the ability to plan and organize is directly related to the good schedules, thus helping them avoid missing things."	B_S0
"For example, when my uncle was a students in the university, he got massive jobs such as final paper, experiements in the lab, and the loaded part-time job in the library, for evry time near the final term."	I_S0
"My uncle always scheduled depending on the importance of every job in the beginning of everyday and thus avoided the situation in which he may miss something important like deadline of the final paper."	I_S0
"As a result, my uncle can always complete the jobs in time and get a good grade."	E_S0
"In addition, the ability ot plan and organize can increase people's efficiency."	S_M1
"Nowadays, there is an increase in the things that can distract people's attention, such as smartphones or video games, reducing their productivities important in the modern life."	B_S1
"The people who have the ability to plan and organize can make a schedule about everyday's jobs, and when they complete one of the goal of the schedule, they are able to focus on the next important job rather than distracted by other things, making their attention concentrate well on the most neccessary jobs and increasing their efficiency."	E_S1
"All in all, the people who are able to plan and organize can life successfully in the complex modern life due to the ability to avoid missing important things and access a higher efficiency."	S_C2
 
"From my point of view, I disagree with the statement that it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than that relax by doing physical exercise."	B_T0
"Reasonable as it may sound, it is in fact ill-conceived."	I_T0
"My opinions are as follows."	E_T0
"First of all, reading a book or watching a movie doesn't amount to better relaxation or entertainment, it may take much more energies."	S_M0
"Many books are prodigious, like Ulysis, thus requiring much better energy to fully understand them."	B_S0
"Movies, similarly, are sometimes so moving that they make you bale, not relaxed at all."	I_S0
"As is more often the case, you are really engaged when reading a book or watching a movie, and your brain is calculating, imaging and reasoning all the time."	I_S0
"The energy they cost will only be more instead of less than doing physical exercise."	E_S0
"Besides, physical exercise is another effective way to relax as well."	S_M0
"It contributes to fully strech of your body, especially after a tiring day."	B_S1
"When you have finished your work, leaving the table, why not go out and take a walk or jog, which is much more fun than reading a book under the dull light or wathcing a movie in the crowded cinema."	E_S1
"Last but not least, the statement ignores the variety interest of people."	S_M0
"There are people who love reading, and there are definitely people who are opposite."	B_S0
"You cannot expect Tyson to relax better when reading than boxing, or Newton to enjoy more fun when diving than studying physics."	I_S0
"The statement is too subjective and supply no substance to confirm it."	E_S0
"To sum up, wathcing a movie, reading a book or doing physcal exercise, are all good choice to relax yourself."	B_C0
"The preference indeed varies from person to person."	I_C0
"There will never be a guaranttee that a specific activity will lead you to relax better."	I_C0
"Hence, unless it provides more evidence, I'd say it is intenable."	E_C0
 
"Nowadays, some students choose to take one year off between finishing school and go to college, to travel or to work."	S_T1

"Beatiful scenes, friendly local people, and special food will make up our memory forever."	I_S0

"What's more, Some people may be unwilling to end the relaxed day they had in the last year."	I_S0

"I agree with this idea, but punishment shouldn't occur on a kid."	S_T0
"As we all know that people could access to many imformations and data due to the developed technology of the internet thesedays, so do the children."	S_M1
"If they can tell right from wrong, they could assess the information themselves."	B_S0
"If children in kindergarden is taught that violence is bad for them, they won't touch any topic and informations to violence."	I_S0
"Also, if a child is taught what is right and wrong, they will start to cognize the world and could have thoughts of their own."	E_S0

"But we shouldn't use punishment to reach our goal for bad thing may permanently hurt a child's heart and mind, thus pose a bad threaten to the rest of his or her life."	I_S1
"We should use a gental way."	E_S1
"It's of great importance for kids to learn what is right from wrong, but punishment shouldn't be implemented."	S_C2

"With icreasing of needs in resources,like food, clothes, and buildings, the opinion of protecting wild animal and wildness areas is smothen."	B_T1
"However, I strongly believe that it is significant for future generation to protect wild animals and wilderness areas."	E_T1
"First of all,wild animals is a important part of the whole enviromen because every part in nature play a role in connecting the enviromental curve and  hold the balance of nature."	S_M2
"For exanple, the big fisth will eat the small fish, but if there is no big fish, the small fish will be too more."	B_S0

"Nowadays, the governments and medical care organizations have been taking actions to improve the quality of medical care."	B_I0
"And whether this phenomenon's merits outweigh its defects is a moot point."	E_I0
"From my perspective, improving medical care and  expanding life is positive on the whole."	S_T0
"Admittedly, since people can live longer due to the advanced medical technology, the elderly do not have jobs and income and they need social resource to live, thereby leading to a heavy burden on their children and the social pension system."	B_M1
"Nevertheless, with the , people can devoted more time to their carees, therefore creating more worth to society."	E_M1
"For example, if scientists could live longer, they would accomplish their researchs and contribute more scientific outcomes to the world."	B_S2
"Moreover,citzens' living standard will improve when they have longer life expectancy, because they can enjoy more lesure activities with a healthy body and they do not have stress."	E_S2
 
"Because the world is changing so quickly, people in the world have more and  more pressures (work, study, home rent and other pressures)."	B_T1
"Because of this , many people think people now are less happy or less satisfied with their lives than people were in the past."	E_T1
"But in my point of view, I think people have more happy or satisfied than past."	S_T0
"First, people live in today, there are many ways to find happiness, and it is easier  than past to find satisfaction."	S_M0
"With the development of society, the quality of people's life is much better than in the past."	B_S0

"With the improvement of science and technology and people's living standard,our choice of TV programs is also diversified."	S_T1
"But the phenomenon of accessing to a growing number of TV channels arouses various argues for citizens."	B_S0
"Before rendering my position,I aim to discuss both views and come up with my own opintion."	I_S0
"Obvious,those who support more TV channels are mainly due to the fact that they make it easier for individuals to choose variety of TV programs according to personal taster with diverse interests."	I_S0
"For example ,children prefer childish animations and educative programs to broaden their horizons,some young people tend to enjoy entertainment or exciting programs while the elderly are more interested in news channels."	I_S0
"Furthermore,a variety TV programs  will make it easier for people to acess things they have never known or know what they want to know."	I_S0
"However,some people claim that more programs cannot guarantee their quality."	I_S0
"First and the main concern is about the type of TV programs that there is no distinct line between high-quality and low-quality programs,rusulting inthe production of TV programs with poor quality compares with excellent similar programs."	I_S0
"On the other hand,the professional quality of program producers is not capable of keeping up with the number of TV programs."	I_S0
"As far as I am concerned,lathough increasing TV channels have shortcomings, such as negatively influence individuals' mental development because of unhealthy programs on TV,they can greatly satisty the needs of the resifens,but in my opintion, the bad influence should be stopped."	E_S0
 
"The professor disagrees with the statement made in the passage that ues device to plant trees will not be successful in fighting against desertification."	S_T1
"The writter believes that this plan cannot successful, yet the professor thinks the opposite is true."	S_T0
"To start with, the passage writes that the coast of this device is very expensive, and for many countries may cannot afford to buy this devices for millions of trees."	S_M0
"However the professor says that this device can help young trees to grow and one device can be reused about 20 times."	B_S1
"So the coast of this device is reasonable."	E_S1
"In addition, the author alleges that fighting desertification need local people to install and maintain the device, but people living in such areas work in harsh conditions."	S_M0
"Maybe sometimes they cannot provide food for their family, not mention to maintain those devices."	B_S0
"Nevertheless, the speaker points that it is true that this device cannot provide food for people, but this device can help people to get water, and irrigate their food."	I_S0
"And also the trees can provide firewoods for those people."	E_S0
"The last, the writer asserts that the trees cannot survive in such a harsh environment for there are not enough water to help trees to grow."	S_M0
"Nonetheless, the listening holds an opposite view that this device can help trees grow a long root in order to absorb water from underground."	B_S1
"Moreover, the trees can live for 2 years after they leave this device."	E_S1
 
"Nowadays, people like to use social media to chat with others, because it is more interesting and convenient."	S_I0
"So when it comes to quesion of "when classmates or colleagues communicate about a project in person instead of by email, they can produce a better work"."	B_T1
"Many of the poeple will choose to dissagree, because of the inconvenience of in person communication."	E_T1
"However, I personally agree with this point of view, the reasons are chiefly as below."	S_T0
"To begin with, I think the most important aspects that constitute to a great work is discussion."	S_M1
"Because we all know that if we add everyone's effort together, we can have a wider range of knowledge, thus have a better chance to solve a problem which is not likely to be solved by individual."	B_S0
"Take my personal experience for example, I had once been required to write a paper about golf skills and strategies."	I_S0
"Since I am really good at playing golf, I choose to work by myself."	I_S0
"However, I found the whole process way complicated than I expected, I used so much time to finish the paper."	I_S0
"On the next time, I worked with one of my friends, we had meet each other and discussed a lot."	I_S0
"As a result, we use only one day to finish the whole draft, and obtain a high grade from our teacher."	I_S0
"This directly prove that discussion can save many of your time and improve your quality of work."	E_S0
"Secondly, I think if two person work together in person, they can be more relax than communicate on email."	S_M1
"Because you two can correct the mistakes immediately after you find them out."	B_S0
"Instead, when you work online, it is sometimes hard for you to correct the mistakes."	I_S0
"In this case, a better work are more likely to be produced."	I_S0
"Accordingly to the research, when people are more relaxed and less stressful, they are more likely to concentrate, and have a higher rate of success."	I_S0
"Also take my experience for example, I used to work with my brother in person to draw a portrait."	I_S0
"At the beginning, we don't even think that we can finish, since we both haven't been taught how to draw portrait."	I_S0
"However, since we don't have too much pressure, we produced a portrait within two hours."	I_S0
"We both got shocked by our performance."	E_S0
"Lastly, I have to admit that there is advantage of communicating on email."	B_C0
"For example, some people will be more exited when using computer and phone."	I_C0
"However, consider that fact work with other in person can have a better discussion and more comfortable environment, it is difinitely more easy to produce a better work."	E_C0
 
"Recently, a topic that is related to communication has aroused a heated debate: it is better to communicate in person rather than through emails among colleagues or classmates when doing a project."	S_T1
"Some people think that emails seem to be more formal than face to face."	B_T0
"However, I definitely agree that communicating in person is better than through emails in order to do a project."	E_T0
"To begin with, face to face is the most direct approach for people to communicate with others."	S_M1
"It is common that people misunderstand others when communicating through messages or emails, because the texts are neither alive nor dynamic, and people usually cannot understand others thoughts by reading only the texts."	B_S0
"Many words have more than one meaning and the meanings are contrasting, which will cause bad effects no matter when doing a project or dealing some problems."	I_S0
"For example, I once sent an email to my partner about my idea on our teamwork."	I_S0
"She was not at school because it was a weekend."	I_S0
"She misunderstood me and made a thing that is not m

"	E_S0
"Moreover, communicating in person is the most effective way to finish a project."	S_M1
"Emails usually cannot be read in time when there is no signal or others are busy, which will decrease the efficiency of working and studying."	B_S0
"What is more, it needs a lot of time to tying and discribing one's opinion through emails, which is a waste of time."	I_S0
"On the contrary, if people communicate with others in person, they will be able to know each others meaning, and eliminate the gap between their understandings."	E_S0
"From what has been mentioned above, communicating in person is not only the most direct but also the most effective way for people to do a project, which may also promote their relationship."	S_C2
 
"I disagree with the idea that in the past,people can easier to identify what type  of career or job would lead to a secure,successful future."	S_T0
"First of all,the world changes every single second."	B_T1
"For example,some people used to be a clerk of country's department store."	E_T1
"They think that the job won't change because country is well,but after few years,the clerks are laid-off together bacause country do not want to have so many clerk and want to change the economic condition."	B_T0
"When we say a job may lead you to a secure successful future."	E_T0
"For the most part, it is because of a lack of understanding of the world, resulting in poor judgment."	S_S2
"secondly,most of the peopel who hold this kind of thought may end up not very good."	S_M1
"Because usually they think that this job can bring them the wealth and status they want, so they don't study other knowledge."	B_S1
"But the world is changing, and you can't predict where the world will go next, so if you lose your job, you don't have any other skills to apply for another job, and you have no chance of getting a great future."	E_S1
"Thirdly,In the past, most people chose to work as employees of state-owned enterprises and civil servants."	S_M1
"The older generation assumed that such occupations would have the advantages of a safe work environment and a high degree of upward mobility."	B_S0
"But I think this kind of view is wrong, because the risk and the opportunity coexist, you do not put effort, dare not to take risks, you can not succeed."	I_S0
"Just like a successful investor who dares to invest and is good at seizing opportunities."	I_S0
"But a civil servant on a fixed salary who only wants to muddle along can't succeed."	E_S0
"According to those three reasons."	B_C1
"I disagree that in the past it is easier to identify what type of career job will lead you to a secure successful future."	E_C1
 
"Some people believe parents should teach their children to be good members of society, but I and others think school is the main place for this to be taught."	S_T0
"The main reason why I think schools should primarily be responsible for teaching children to be good members of society is that children spend more time at school with teachers than with their parents."	S_M0
"The children are also in a formal learning environment."	B_S0
"This combination provides more opportunities for teachers to show children how to behave as good members of society."	I_S0
"The teachers can also ensure that all the children have the same chance to learn the same things about being good members of society."	E_S0
"If parents are made more responsible for teaching their children to be good members of society, then many parents might find they do not have the time for this."	S_M0
"Parents have many responsibilities such as work and taking care of the home."	B_S0
"Of course, many parents will naturally prefer to do other things with their children, such as having fun and visiting places of interest."	I_S0
"In addition, some parents might not be as experienced as teachers at teaching children, so the children might not learn as well as at school."	E_S0
"There will always be plenty of parents who have the time, willingness and ability to teach their children to be good members of society."	S_M0
"However, many more will find it difficult and need extra help."	B_S0
"Some will ask other parents or consult books or websites."	I_S0
"I do not think there is anything wrong with this, but we should not assume that all parents will do it."	E_S0
"In summary, I think parents will often teach their children to be good members of society, but this should mainly be done at schools."	S_C2
 
"In these years there are some edition editing books about the autobiography of Stiven Jobs."	B_I0
"They said they have the enough things to prove the book is perfect inllustrate the span of jobs."	I_I0
"However can we know a real personfrom the book?"	E_I0

"The reading material holds that it is impossible for people to establish and keep a permanent human presence on Venus because of the extreme and inhospitable condition on it, however, the professor argues that constructing an permanent human presence that floating in atmoshere 15 kilometers above the surface of Venus is a possible solution."	O
"First, the reading material alludes to the fact that the atmospheric pressure could do great damage to whatever human might land on Venus, yet the professor asserts that the atmospheric pressure would not be a problem for a human presence in the air."	S_M0
"This is because atmospheric pressure becomes lower when the altitude get higher."	B_S1
