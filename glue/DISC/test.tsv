3.0	As this information period advances, it is highly easy for people to receive a myriad of opinions from celebrities such as famous entertainers and athletes.
3.0	Are their opinions so important for us?
11.0	Nevertheless, for me the thoughts for older people are more valuable for us than they are from celebrities.
4.0	In the first place, lots of older people have mastery on some fields; in this condition, their opinion about relative fields are undoubtedly important than the thoughts of famous people without this kind of knowlege.
8.0	For instance, my uncle who works in bank always ask help from my father about problems on marketing analysis and budget planning owing into the fact that my father who majors in economy and works in this field for thirty years has sumless experiences and insight on economy.
8.0	Depending on my father's advisable opinion, my uncle earn achieve his own goals in a short time.
8.0	Nevertheless, if my uncle follow some athletes who almost do not understant marketing, he may lost all of his money and has a big fail on business.
8.0	Therefore, when we meet some professional problems, we are supposed to ask help from older people who have lots of experiences and relative knowledge.
4.0	Secondly, we can not blindly follow the celebrities' opinion because we have totally different condition such as the the big difference on self-supply ability.
8.0	My brother, James recently follow the idea that the most important thing in life is to ejoy because he saw one famous actor said that on television.
8.0	Then he only plays computer games and shops rather than go to the school because the relax is his most important thing.
8.0	Nevertheless, my mother totally disagree with this opinion because these famous actors can only enjoy depend on their long term hardworking and they can feed themself.
8.0	However, James is only a students and he even ask help from parents to feed himself.
8.0	Therefore, without thinking about his own condition, James even can not graduate let alone have a good life in future if he persist this brief.
8.0	The opinion of my mother that he need to study well will make him obtain a good life unlike the celebrities' rediculous thoughts.
4.0	Finally, lots of opinions of celebrities are only contribute for they own disadvantages.
8.0	Lots of famous basketball players claims that it is necessary for players to wear Nike shoes because this pair of shoes can help people do a good job in games.
8.0	However, older people disagrees with this because they think this shoes are expensive and similar to nomar shoes.
8.0	Actually, the opinions of older people are right because the famous basketball player in order to advertise certain brands and get money.
2.0	To sum up, I as into tune that we the older people's opinion are more important than celebrities.
11.0	I think it's a good idea.
12.0	As the society developing rapidly, meterialist is more and more commom in our daily life.
12.0	Money which might be the direct symbolization of the meterialist is used as the reward widly.
11.0	Under this situation, i will give three aspects of reasons to support my opinion.
5.0	First of all, I think money is a good way to encourage their children.
8.0	As we known, money isn't prefect, but we can survive without money.
8.0	Your children can buy some snacks or toys which they have dreamed for a long time with these money, which will make them more energetic.
8.0	After they taste the result of getting the good grade, they will be willing to get more.
5.0	On the other hand, it's a essential class for our children before stepping into the society.
8.0	We get the pay for what we pay.
8.0	In the adult's world, they are also offered money from their boss for each good result they get in work.
8.0	Accordingly, money is common to regarded as the award.
8.0	Someone may think it's a unresponsable for their child to make them facing the money-society too early.
8.0	However,  Inevitably, parents don't always know what their chidren want.
8.0	Thurs, a specific gift for their children won't be the best.
8.0	Money could be the most straigst way to award their children and perhaps decrease the confiction that their children don't like the gift which is selected consideratly by their parents.
1.0	Since the three above-mentioned reason.
1.0	I think it's a good idea that some parents offer the money and money should be the best and the most efficient way to let the children get the further development.
3.0	Everyday we will meet lots of different people.
3.0	Importantly our happenies is based on the relationship with others.
3.0	Nowadays we increasingly value the relationship with others in our life.
11.0	Even the people surrounding me are different such as the family member, teachers, friends, I think that the most important consideration in every connection is honest.
4.0	In the first place, we always telling the truth to family members can bring famimly closer.
8.0	As we know, the family members are the people who love me the most.
8.0	When I have mistakes, they will forgive that and also enclose me.
8.0	When I feel frustrate, they will encaurage me at the first time.
8.0	When I am happy, they will feel happy too and congratulate me.
8.0	I always share my inner world in front of my family as these behavior can create more interaction between I and my family members.
8.0	Even I cannot always accopany them, I can always tell the truth to them, which makes us closer.
4.0	In the second place, that we share our realist mood with our friends can help us better adapt our temper.
8.0	The friends are the people who know us the most since we always have chat and excange our opinion.
8.0	Take myself as an instance.
8.0	In the past, I never tell truth to my friends even I was so sad.
8.0	I always tolerated all sadness by myself.
8.0	Recently, I lost my girlfiend and I tell this truth to my best friend Tom.
8.0	He take me to wath the movie in the movie theater and communicate will me.
8.0	That makes me feel better and I rapidly escape from the sadness.
8.0	Through this experiens I find that telling truth to your friend is not ambarrased and that can adapt your mood fastly.
4.0	Finally, telling the truth to your teacher can help your better improving your grades.
8.0	As we know lots of people like hide their shortcomming in front of their teacher due to the point that they want save their face.
8.0	However, these hiden shortcomming cause the bad grades finally.
8.0	When I study in the university, I always telling the truth to my teacher and honestly ask them.
8.0	Fortunatly, they are helpful and always have discussion with me.
8.0	I even tell them my problem in the life, not to mention the difficulties in the study.
8.0	That behavior makes me advance gradually.
1.0	To sum up, telling the truth to any relationship between people will bring us lots of positive impacts.
1.0	We can have a closer family relationship and have a better mood in life.
11.0	It is very difficult to do a company well because there are many things people needs to concern about.
12.0	The facters that influence the employment.
11.0	Just one little detail can change many things.
12.0	What work to give to the workers to make then satisfying?
12.0	It is a quastion that borthers many employers.
12.0	In my opinion, different types of work satisfy workers better than similar tasks.
4.0	Indeed, one similar job seems easier to finish.
8.0	Workers can just do the same things again and again, which is a simple task for them.
8.0	It's possible that they will think the work easy to finish and be satisfied with it.
8.0	Also, after many times practicing the same thing, people can be skillful and they can finish each task more and more quickly.
8.0	With these improvement, they will gain a sence of achievement.
8.0	People are always satisfied with the work that provide them achievement.
4.0	However, it can attrack employees attention from distractions to do different jobs.
8.0	When people are tired with doing certain thing, they are likely to do some other things to change their attention.
8.0	If they just do the same work, they will just do things that is not connecting with work, which will make them unefficient.
8.0	But when different skills, are given to them, they can put this one away and do another.
8.0	This can lessen the time workers use on doing other things and finish more work.
8.0	And finding that they finish much work efficiently can satisfied them and let them like their jobs.
4.0	Furthermore, workers may feel their work flexible.
9.0	If people can deicde what to do first what to do next, they will feel free and be satisfied.
9.0	I always feel happy when I can ch
1.0	In conclusion, although Doing similer tasks have some benefit on workers, it is more attractive and beneficial to do different work.
1.0	Thus, I suggest employers to offer more different job to workers.
11.0	I agree that people are more willing to help the struggling strangers.
11.0	Because that`s what I`m willing to do.
12.0	"There is an old saying goes""Helping others is helping yourself""."
11.0	While helping others, we can gain lots of things that can`t be bought.
12.0	And it`s gracious of you to help struggling strangers.
5.0	Helping struggling strangers sometimes will let you gain new friendship.
8.0	When I borrow a book in the library, I meet a mate who have trouble in returning the books.
8.0	It seems that he didn`t know he had missed the deadline to return the books.
8.0	He had to pay for overdue fee.
8.0	But he didn`t know where to pay for it.
8.0	Looking at him helpness, I desided to help him.
8.0	So I bring him to the information desk and sole his problem.
8.0	After that, we became good friends and we alwayse hellp each others with study.
5.0	To go up and say, the world is becoming more and more friendly.
8.0	People help each others even they don`t know each others.
8.0	"Do you know ""Trval on a Budget""?"
8.0	That means people who don`t have enough money to go somewhere can travel by free ride.
8.0	The traveler and car owners are stranger.
8.0	But they still are willing to help each others.
8.0	Because you can gain sense of happiness when you recive others` thanks.
1.0	As you can see, the world is becoming more and more unify.
1.0	People are more rely on others than ever before.
7.0	So I think there will be
3.0	Nowadays, people's life has been more and more complex, the question regarding whether young peolpe should have the ability to plan and orgnize has provoked a lot attention from many people.
11.0	Some people thinks it will be not useful and a waste of time, and young people should spend more time on other things.
11.0	However, I have a different idea, and I will utilize two different reasons to support my standpoint.
5.0	First of all, the number of population in the world has been more and more, and the competition among young people must be more and more violent, so the ability to plan and organize will play a more and more essential role in looking for job or other things in the future.
8.0	For instance, if two people come to a company to interview for one job, the interviewer will be more likely to choose the one who can make plans and orgnize others for the company.
8.0	Normally, most interviewers are looking forward to that their staffs can do more things amd have a good overal situation, because this kind of workers can give better adcice for the development in the future of one enterprice.
8.0	Also, these people will more likely to have higher income, because they usually are manager in the company in the future, young people will have more benifits in works by this ability in the future.
5.0	Secondly, young people sometimes are irritable when they make decisions, so they often mke some wrong.
8.0	If they cultivate this kind of ability, they will think twice before they do works and make decision, it really helps them to be more efficient in the works and life.
8.0	For instance, one person who can organize his own things well, he will make plan before he do something, so his life will be clear, and he will do the things by the most rapid and the best way.
8.0	Then, he will have more time to do the things he likes.
1.0	It is no doubt that any kind of people all have their life style, and they can live in this kind of style well.
1.0	Nevertheless, I think a smart young people will be more likely to plan his life, or try to adapt to this kind of atmosphere
3.0	During our everyday life, we can see many things which can try their best to make our lives simpler and easier.
3.0	I believe that you all have seen the machinery that continue to make products no matter day or night.
3.0	Besides, the phone, one of the products that we use most in our lives can often be seen around you.
11.0	Those all are the good things to us and there is no doubt that we are experiencing an easier and more comfortable life than it wsa when our grand parents were children.
5.0	First, mutiply things are finished by robots and machinery instead of persons.
8.0	You can go to some factory where produce some necessites for us.
8.0	They are so big and productive that we almost cannot continue our normal life without the products that are produced there.
8.0	And in the factory the machinery play a very important role.
8.0	If we could not use the machineries any more, how much efforts the workers would pay to get the same effective.
8.0	And many researchers are still inventing the robots that consume less energy so our lives could be more comfortable and easier.
5.0	Secondly, our society is filled with some electronic products such as mobile phone which is making the life easier.
8.0	Take the letter for an example.
8.0	In the past, people must wait for a long time to get letter from their family or friends because of the previous way to send letter is not efficient.
8.0	But now if we miss a frined who lives far away from us, we can just spend several minutes writing a letter and then press the send icon so the friend can get our mail in a second.
8.0	This is what the advanced life brings to us, convinience and comfort.
8.0	By using this, we can achieve a same goal but using less resources and efforts than the past.
0.0	Lastly, some people may disapprove this because people nawdays must put much effors in edcation so they can feed themselves, which is not comfortable than the past.
0.0	But in my opinion, this is surely a comfort.
0.0	When our grandparents are children, they need to work on the farm so the family can get enough income to feed the family, but now we can just sit in the room and read books or finish the assignments that professor gives us.
0.0	It is surely a comfort.
7.0	So the life today is more
12.0	College students is the driving force a nation's development, the quality of education has become the most significant topic.
12.0	Thus some people propose that the salaries of universities professors should be increased, however I think universities should prefer to taking multiple methods to improve the quality of education rtather than just spending money on professors.
4.0	To begin with, hardware is the indispensable component of a good university.
8.0	WIth the increase population in campus, school should pay more attention to premote the infrastracture of school, such as restaurant and dormitory condition.
8.0	Taking myself as an example, there were considerable students living in the campus, so school put a lot of mony on expanding the dining hall to fit all the students need.
8.0	Besides, air condition are offered at every dorm, so we do not need to suffer from cold winter.
8.0	By doing so, our school attract more people to apply for our university.
4.0	Second, scholarship is also an unneglected factor for universities.
8.0	Better a university is, the more scholarship it will offer.
8.0	WIth the help of scholarship, students whose families are in poor conditions can have chance to purse their academic dreams.
8.0	Also, it is the most attractive award for top students, which in turn helps studends bring the best part of themselves.
8.0	If universities spend more money on salaries of professor, it is not likely to spare more money on student's scholarship.
4.0	Admittedly, universities's professors are the most essential factor of college students development, and should be taking seriously.
8.0	However, there is a survy reveal that most professor earned much more money compared to the other occupation.
8.0	On top of that, their incomes also comes from their research results.
8.0	So it is their duty to be more dedicated to their work due to high salary.
7.0	All in all, of universities have enough money, they should consider to really make use of them and take variety ways to improve the quality of education, especially I mentioned
3.0	Different people have different ideas.
3.0	But i think it is right.
3.0	It's a wise way.
3.0	Nowadays, further more students cost money on the no-books.
3.0	They spent money on the eletric-toy, going out with friends.
3.0	So it will be wrose for them to have class.
3.0	So the parents should make the rules for made it.
3.0	The parents should keep abreast of the time.
12.0	The parents can offer their children money for thier mrak.
10.0	It's a good way to know how children studied in the school.
6.0	Firstly, the way makes it impossible for children spent money on the bad place.
8.0	Like drug, game room, KTV.
8.0	Only if the children have the good habit.
8.0	They can improve thire grade.
8.0	Secondly, If they have good grade in the school.
8.0	The school-age children should accustom themself to study hard.
8.0	So, they will spent money on the education.
8.0	It's a good circula.
1.0	Different person has different ideas.
1.0	Each coins has two sides.
3.0	An ancient yet effective way of us human learn, from basic values to small life hacks is by experiences, clearly speaking, from past happening.
3.0	By extracting the patterns emerged and consequences paid, civilizations are able to advance futher into a better and better future.
3.0	Numerous news, that are all kinds of experiences and decisions,  happen every day, providing us information about occurances around the globe.
11.0	Some may argue that knowing these is unnessasery, especially if the events are unlikely to affect one's daily life.
11.0	Yet it is actually farily needed for everyone for it provides knowledge and make one always prepared
4.0	To begin with, knowing about news around the world gives one a large sea of oppotunites to learn lessons that may help with daily life, with school or even with lif and societal choices.
8.0	Everyday there's news about wars and conflicts and they often show the results of violence, which are often devastating.
8.0	The photos taken at a Middle East conflict battle field, for example, would shock anyone with conscientious and sympathy, they would fear the outcome of violence and the next time there is a vote for weather one's country should go to war, he or she may vote no and the society would be safer all together.
8.0	Thus getting to know the events around the world is always educational in some way.
4.0	Moreover, just like how the butterfly effect points out, everything is inter-connected in the world.
8.0	What seems non-consequencial and non-influential in one's daily life at present may oneday affect one's life greatly.
8.0	If one ignores all news, say, about the USA, but suddenly got promoted to work in the USA branch of his or her company?
8.0	The lack of information about America would result in the one finding him or herself in cultural shock or being isolated from locals' talks because he/she knows nothing.
8.0	"In fact, that the one doesn't care about the world would hardly lead to this ""promotion"" at all."
8.0	Oppotunites are there for the ones who are prepared, and prepared ones are unlikely to care nothing about the world.
4.0	Nevertheless, knowing too much details can be too time cosuming and need to be avoided.
10.0	Knowing the big events and waht matters is enough.
0.0	Knowledge itself is defined by experiences and understanding the patterns of the world.
0.0	News can be the best source.
0.0	Knowing about the world, even if it sees unrelavent at the moment, is important after all.
11.0	Whether the children should choose jobs that are pertinent to their parents' jobs is a highly debatable one.
12.0	People hold different views when it comes to this topic.
12.0	From my perspective, I'm persuaded that choosing the jobs which are related to thier parents' job can make the children have adventages over thir peer and result in a better relationship with their parents.
5.0	Firstly, choing the jobs related to that of their parents can make the children more competitive.
8.0	Even though parents may not teach their children about their jobs, the situation that children know about what their parents do are not scarce.
8.0	So before this kind of children entering this field, their have already know a lot about the field, which means more competitive compared with those who choose the jobs different from that of their parents.
8.0	Besides that, after they enter the job afterwards, they can seek their parents for help when they are encoutered with some problems or just want some instructions.
8.0	One typical example of this is those famous family company, where children of the manager choose the same occupation as their parents.
8.0	The extensive existense of this kind fo company reveal the advantage this kind of job choice bring.
5.0	Moreever, this kind of job can bring about a better family relationship.
8.0	When the children choose the similar job to their parents when whey grow up, they can talk about what happens during his job in the family.
8.0	Because all the family members know about the basic knowledge of the job, it will not be a problem to understand each other, which means plenty of common topic.
8.0	One common thing happens in many family is that parents will be worried about the occupation situation or development, which is mainly because they don't understand what your working situation is.
8.0	However, such problem will never occur when the children choose the job related to their parents.
8.0	In summary, choosing the jobs related to that of parents can make the family realationship more harmonious.
3.0	There is a heated disscussion regarding whether the partents offer their money for each hight grade students gei in school.
3.0	Pelple is interest in the debate that education influence people’life.
3.0	Different people present dissimilar opinion.
11.0	I agree with the statement.
6.0	This is the primarily fact that students get high mark is very significant .
8.0	What is more,student get hight mark could be invited to a great collage.
8.0	My sister's sistuation aptly illustrates the point.
8.0	My sister was study at a NO.1 middle school which is the best school in he city.
8.0	A few weeks ago,she was bad in her math and always fail in her grade.
8.0	Her mother was worried about her daugher's grade.
8.0	Finally,her monther offer their school-age for get good grade.
8.0	As a result,she get good grades in math and it is a better wethod improve study.
2.0	Although is unfair to offer money,is a important way to students.
3.0	Nowadays, many parents become more and more busy and have little time to spend with their children.
3.0	So the time they spend together become more and more important.
3.0	And the question comes out.
3.0	Should parents play games with kids in the valueless time?
3.0	Or should parents doing some things about schoolwork with children?
3.0	Which is the best way to spend this rare and valuable time?
3.0	In my opinion, playing with kids in that time is a better choice.
12.0	Here is my reasons.
4.0	First, playing with kids in the rare spare time can strengthen the relationship between parents and kids.
8.0	And this kind of relationship is active.
8.0	Children have fun with parents and they will feel warm and happy with it.
8.0	They can notice that they are loved by their parents, although parents have little time with them, and the kids won't feel lonely.
4.0	In addition, it can help children relax when parents spent that time to have fun playing games or sports with their children.
9.0	The school life is hard enough to make kids feeling stressed out.
9.0	Playing games with kids can help them take it easy and relax.
4.0	Finally, as far as I'm conserned, schools can handle the things well about the schoolwork of children.
7.0	There are so many professional tea
12.0	There is no denying the fact that parents should not connect the money and grades, so it is a bad idea for parents to give their children money when they get good grades.
5.0	First, just for children, scores are just a reaction during their study time, whether grade is good or not, study could not be a way to get rewards.
8.0	Study is a only for students to get improved, and it is of critical significance for students to use to live and work better in the future.
8.0	As a result, if a student know what they should get most, they should refuse the money from their parents.
8.0	Taking an example, one of my best friends, whose mother once gave his some money because of his good scores, refused the money, and told his mother that study could not be contacted by parents' money, he did not want to get successful in study depending on parents' money.
8.0	When a student knows the study is his onw resbonsibility, he will always succeed in study.
5.0	On the contary, for parents, they are not supposed to regards the money as a way of couragement.
8.0	Money could move everyone's deep heart, and parents could not make the students think study is a way of getting money.
8.0	Study is to take resbonsibiity of their own futures.
8.0	Meanwhile, giving money could give the students wrong attention when learning, because they will not focus on the money instead of real study.
8.0	For example, my father used to told me if I could get a full mark in a math test, he could give me some money to buy whatever I want.
8.0	After that, I always wanted what I would buy when getting the money.
8.0	Nevertheless, I failed in that test and missed everything.
8.0	So it is not helpful for parents to give students money for good scores.
2.0	In a word, to give children money for their good mark is not a helpful way for the real students' study.
12.0	I don't think offering school-age children money for high grades is a good idea.
11.0	The reasons are as follows: First of all, learning is something children should fall in love with sincerely, rather than a thing that should be supported by money or else.
11.0	Once getting a lower grade, children tend to become upset  and unconfident about themselves, which will reverse parents' initial intention.
5.0	Secondly, getting high grades means getting money, which tends to force children to become a man whose hearts are fully filled with money and aggressive about every success and failure.
9.0	In my opinion, it is not a good phenomenon.
9.0	Children should grow up with their whole hearts pure and simple.
5.0	Thirdly, i think just offering money for children's high remarks is not ennough to make them develop healthily, in addition to it, children should be provided with some candies or else in that they should be told it is not a shame to be a failure, instead it is a shame not to corret themselves and develop themselves.
10.0	By doing this, children can grow up physically and mentally healthy.
0.0	Last but not least, it is my own experience that tells me that failure is the mother of success and even more important.
0.0	It is a normal state to be honored for success and laughed at for failure.
0.0	But my mother teaches me that results are not important,instead, the fact that makes me become who i am is more valuable and meaningful.
3.0	How to motivate a child to study hard is a common problem that parents face.
3.0	Some parents offer their children money for each high grade they get in order to encourage them.
12.0	As far as I'm concerned, it is not an ideal way to motivate a child.
4.0	At the begining, money is just an extrinsic motivation, which won't last long.
8.0	That is what I learn in psychology class.
8.0	Think about that, every time a child get a good grade, his parents offers him money.
8.0	What if the parents forget to offer the money one time?
8.0	The child will be frustrated or even angry, and lose the motivation to dedicate energy and time into academic performance.
8.0	Only when the parents continue to offer the money, the child will be willing to study harder.
8.0	I also learned that only intrinsic motivation can work in a long period of time.
8.0	So the parents should help their child to build up inner confidence and make them feel satisfied and be proud of themselve when getting high mark.
4.0	Besides, children will be misguided and form incorrect value of money and effort if they are motivated by money.
9.0	In this case, children would have a belief that the reason why they go to school, do the assignments, get involved in academic seminar is just to get high grade and the money offered by parents.
9.0	How ridiculous!
4.0	It is because study can increase a person's value, enrich his knowlegement, broaden his horizon and position him to contribute to the society and world that people have to learn.
9.0	A good grade can be a certification of the effort that a person make.
9.0	So the children should know that they study for their career and future, not for the money.
2.0	In a nut shell, I don't agree that offering money to a child for each high grade they get is a proper way to motivate children.
3.0	From my point of view,I'm firmly oppose that some parents offer their school-age children money for high grade mark they get in school.
3.0	First of all,stutying is the main job for the school-age children.
8.0	If they get a lot of money to satisfy their desire,they may not highlight their schoolwork.
12.0	As a result ,they will get low grades in school and turn not that well-behaved.
8.0	Their parents will surely notice this change but they can't realize the reason of it.
8.0	If they can't communicate well with their kids ,conflict will show up between their relationship.
8.0	Secondly,the children will fail to have a healthy method of storing and using money if they get high amount of money in their pocket.
8.0	They won't understand how difficult their parents earn the money.
8.0	When they grow up and get into the society,they will find it too much hard to get enough money to satisfy their need in their own life.
8.0	Then they can't get finance independent and continue to rely on their old parents who probably get retired.
8.0	All this bad situation is due to the high grade money their parents offer them when they are kids.
6.0	There is an example to what I have said above.
8.0	A girl name Mary got his parents' credit card when she was a primary school student to use.
8.0	From then she bought everything she wanted without concearning about the price.
8.0	By doing that she made lot of friends.
8.0	With time goes on,the things she bought turned from clothes and bags to many luxuries.
8.0	Her prents is not  that rich,soon they couldn't offer their daughter's need .
8.0	After she spent all the money,she was not possible to understand her parents and they had a big argument.
8.0	She moved out angrily to have her own life.
8.0	But she was frustrated to find she could hardly make it by herself.
8.0	Mary finally know how hard the money can be earned.
10.0	th
12.0	From my persepective, I think that offering money for high grades is not a good idea.
8.0	As it is known to us, the reason why parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade is that they want their children to get better grade so that they might be admitted by famous universities.
8.0	But I strongly believe that this behavior may work in a short time, but it won't useful in the long term.
8.0	For example,Tony was a middle school student who studied hard enough to get high grades.
8.0	In this circomstance, he studied by his own, enjoying the fun of voluntary study.
8.0	However, his parents suddenly wanted to pay him money for his good grades.
8.0	At the beginning, he was delighted to accept the money, and have another strong inspiration to study hard and get good grades.
8.0	Unfortunately, his motive for study was no longer pure as before, because he studied for getting money from his parents.
8.0	As time past by, if his parents didn't offer him enough money that Tony expected, Tony would lose the desire for studing hard and getting good grades.
8.0	The most harmful thing is that Tony would gradually lose the love for study.
8.0	Seeing the disadvantages causing by offering money for children's study, we can draw the conclusion that parents should not offering money for high grade children get in school.
11.0	I have to say that I do agree with the statement and I think it is becoming a serious problem in our society.
4.0	There is more and more news such as someone refused to feed their parents or left their parents and kids in countryside without giving them enough money to afford their life.
8.0	However,at the same time,more and more people would be moved by somebody who shared his or her poor life maybe in a TV show.
8.0	And some others would give the money to the people who is in rags rather than buying some food for their relatives.
8.0	From all above,it is obvious that people today are more willing to help the struggling strangers.
4.0	In my opnion,it is easy to understand how the situation formed.
8.0	First,familiars are the people who know us well,not only our  advantages but also our shortbacks.
8.0	Thus we do not like them for the most of time.
8.0	But a stranger is one who does not know our names or even has not meet us yet.
8.0	So it is more easy for people to share their kindness with strangers.
4.0	Except above reasons,there is still another important cause.
9.0	It is that people consider fame as the most important thing, but not families or friends ever.
9.0	It is really an unpleasant thing to happen in today's society.
7.0	I think nothing can be more important than our families and
3.0	As the development in our society, there are more and more families choose to buy a car as their tool for insteading walking.
3.0	In fact, we cannot deny that the appearance of cars brings negative effect to our environment, and the traffic jams also waste us a lot of time.
12.0	Thus, with the negative effects come into our life, people will lessen the userate of cars, so I believe that in the future there will be fewer cars then there are today.
6.0	To begin with, the advant of pollution triggers the alarm of people's mind.
8.0	These years, environmental pollutions become a hot topic for people, and residents are care about how to control the urban pollution.
8.0	In fact, a mount of car exhaust causes elders suffer from respiratory disease.
8.0	My grandmother bought an air cleaner and never open the windows and she would not go to the park to exercise with her friends because of the air pollution.
8.0	Every morning she will check the weather forecast and the pollution indux.
8.0	When she went out, she will choose to take subway or the bus instead of taking the taxi.
8.0	My grandmother also talks to me that I should ride a bike to ge to school.
8.0	People now are care about the environment, and no one wants to live under a grey sky, so more and more people start to change the situation by reducing the use of cars, and in the future there will be fewer cars.
10.0	Second, subway
12.0	The issue of whether students perform should decide the thechers salary is a highly debatable one.
11.0	On the one hand, it can make teacher pay more attention to their quality of education.
12.0	On the other hand, it is unfair because of the variety of students.
12.0	However, in the ultimate analysis, I contend that teachers pay should not be related to what students perform.
5.0	When the teachers salary is according to the students performance, it is unfair for the student who has improved but get a low score.
8.0	For example, when a student who had a poor base of math has improved the score from 10 to 59, he has made great effort and his teacher is trying the best to help him, but in the assess system, the student also fails the exam, and the teacher has decreased the salary.
8.0	Apparently, it is unfair for a good thacher and the endeavour of a student.
8.0	However, if a teacher can hlep a student a lot when she doesn't worry about the pay, it is beneficial for teacher be rewarded with the improvement of students, although the students performance aren't good.
8.0	This way is fair for teachers to get paid when the assess system of students performance has deficiency.
5.0	Also, there are many kinds of factors have influenced the students behaviors.
8.0	The teacher, however, can just help them about 8 hours study in school.
8.0	And even sometimes, a lot of students are absent when teacher has prepared the lesson very well.
8.0	For example, a student always lies to parents to absent the math lesson.
8.0	Although the teacher has persuades the student to listen in class and practice, the student refuses and lies again and again.
8.0	Finally,he fails the exam, and the teacher should be punished to get a lower salary.
8.0	There is an inequity assessment to lead the teacher hasn't gotten the payment and benefits, when a student doesn't want to learn something and lies to people.
8.0	The performance not only decided on teacher's resposibility and skill, but also on what a student's family, attitude, interest, talence and so on.
0.0	We can't ignore the advantage of the relation between students behavior and teachers skill, that will encourage teachers to prepare the lessons well.
0.0	But, it is better to abandon the assesment, because there are lots of disadvantages to both students and teachers, which make the condition be unfair.
0.0	In conclusion, I really disagree with the statement that teachers should be paid for the students perform.
3.0	Recently , an interesting question has aroused heated debate among people : should teachers be paid at least as much as business leaders are paid?
3.0	Answers vary from person to person.
3.0	Some cliam that teachers should not be paid too much.
3.0	However, I sand on the opposite side and I firmly believe that teachers are deserve to be paid too much.
12.0	Some reasons and examples given below can illustrate my point of view.
5.0	First, the job as a teacher is too tired that the teachers deserve to have good salery.
8.0	As we all know the teacher should be stay with students whole day and answers so many different questions.
8.0	Their brains should be used every moment, it is so tired for person.
8.0	Therefore they deserve to get the enough salery.
8.0	For example , my sister is a math teacher in the Wuhan NO.1 high school.
8.0	And every day she needs to get up in the six o'clock and rush to the school to teach students in the morning class.
8.0	And she have sixty five homework needs to check every day.
8.0	So many day work she needs to finish that even in the ten p.m. she just on the way home most days.
8.0	In this situation, she told me if she do not have salary increase, she would quite, because it is so tired.
5.0	Second, it would attract more experience teacher if schools could afford good salary.
8.0	A good salary is main point that attract good teacher, and if the school have so many famous teacher who teach many A-level students, the school could take more good students and therefore the school can have a great income.
8.0	It is a positive circle.
8.0	On the contrary, if one school cannot provide a high salary for their teachers, the experience teacher would lose their motivation to stay in their school.
8.0	For example, the Wuhan university is so famous in the whole country because of their high salary for teachers and their outstanding students.
8.0	My friend Sam is a good English teacher who have many effective way to teach English words and make students remember it so clearly.
8.0	He firstly stand on the Hubei University, but this school did noy pay much attention to him and give little salary.
8.0	So he jump to the Wnhan university which have high salary for experience teachers.
1.0	To pit it in the nutshell.
1.0	Teachers should be paid much, it not only because they deserve it but also because it should attract more good teachers to work in the school.
11.0	Nowadays most people choose to do physical exercise in order to relax ,while I believe that it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book .
4.0	"Firstly,people won""t get tired if they relax by watching a movie or reading a book ."
8.0	When people do these things,they can just shut off their brains and enjoy the book you are reading or the movie you are watching.
8.0	If you simply wanna relax ,you can watch comedies;if you intend to forget narrows, read books that can comfort you and cheer you up;if you are a fan of scary movies,you can just get some in your spare time,especially after a busy day of work.
8.0	However,doing physcial exercise requires us to move our bodies extremely instead of letting us sit and relax.
8.0	It only make us more exhausted after doing exercise and it dosen't have the ability to change our moods.
4.0	Secondly,watching a movie or reading a book can help us gain many new experieces and obtain fresh sensations about the world.
8.0	There are many useful and significant viewpoints in books and movies.
8.0	Sometimes it even can lead us to a right way in our life.
8.0	In addition,there are many solutions for us to resolve a complicated problem.
8.0	Although different people have diverse feelings even though they read the same book or watch the same movie.
8.0	we have to admit that we abtain new things after doing these things.
8.0	Physical exercise can' t improve us.
4.0	I don't say it is quite useless to do physical exercise to relax,it is a good way to release stress,in fact.
10.0	The thing is that watching a movie or reading a book can do both things easily and they have more benefits for humans,so it is just better.
2.0	There are the reasons why I think it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book.
10.0	t
12.0	i disagree with the following statement.
8.0	because physical exercise can help we keep a good healthy physical.
8.0	if we don not have enough physical exercise.
8.0	we must have a fiu.
8.0	during this flu.
8.0	we also don not watching a movie or reading a book.
8.0	so a good healthy physical is important for us.
8.0	however watching a movie or reading a book can help us improve my grade.
8.0	but don not have good healthy physical.
8.0	you not to do anything.
8.0	let us keep physical exercise.
8.0	have a good healthy physical.
3.0	Nowadays, almost everyone lives in a high-speed modern society, many parents do not have many time to spend with their children, in the small smount of free time, thet will choose play games or sports with their chidren, the other choice is doing some thing that sre related to school works.
11.0	In my opinion, it is better if parents have fun with their children.
4.0	At the begining with, playing with childern can improve the relationship between parents and children.
10.0	those small kids always have many heavy homework in the school and they do not have enough time to play, if parents play with them, they can relaxed for a short time and thet may think their parents can understand them, then the relationship between them and their parents will be more harmonious.
4.0	Secondly, parents spend time to play with their childern can help them underatsnd their children better.
10.0	Because parents are usually very busy, they always tend to neglect the communication with their children, when they play with their children, they can talk lot with them and they can know how was their children's diary life, and also know what  their children are up against, then thet can know how to hep them be a better person.
4.0	At last, playing games and sports also is helpful to their chidren's body.
8.0	today's children always sit in the classroom, and they do not have enough time for activities, parents can help them exercise and relax by play games or sports.
8.0	Nowadays, there are a lot of games are helpful for childre's brain and their body, children can help themselevs while playing with their parents.
8.0	A good body is the foundation of all things as long as they want to any things.
1.0	All in all, the best use of the time which the busy parents spend with their children is to have fun playing games or sports.
1.0	It can have a lot of benefits at same time, it can improve the relationship between parents can childrem, help parents kno their childern better and help childern have a great body.
3.0	Someone think young children watch television is not a big deal.
12.0	But i have different idea,there are some why i disagree with it.
8.0	Adimmitedly,watching television is a good way to know about the newest information.
8.0	Because it can deliver information that come from all over the world.
8.0	Children just need to use their eyes and learn aboutanything First ,it have bad influence on the development of children's brain.
8.0	Because in that time,children's brain is developing,they need to do some good games to stimulate their brain's development.
8.0	Scientists have prove a resulting,the children that always watch television is worse than this children that seldom watch televison in creative,practice,ect.
8.0	For example,my yonger sister like watching ,so she almost stay at home in order to watch.
8.0	Thus,she seldom go out home to play sports , games or communicate with her peers.
8.0	So when she came into school,her teacher found her mind is odder than others.
6.0	Second,it is harmful to childlren's eyes.
8.0	Because in that case,children are too young.
8.0	Their eyes need some natuar conditions to grow.
8.0	If they always watch television at home,and seldom have conncetion with outdoors,it will cause many issues about eyes.
8.0	For instance,my negiborhood has a little girl,her folks like her very much.
8.0	So she can do anything that she wants.
8.0	She prefers to watch cartoon,even her eyes tired.
8.0	But her familiar don't think is a problem.
8.0	One day,she found that she can't see objrects that far away from her.
8.0	When her folks bring her to hospital but found she have big issues about eyes.
3.0	In our daily life,people suffer from hard times,as obstacles and setbacks happen frequently.
3.0	When we see other people in a dilemma,we often don't mind to help them out of our kind heart.
12.0	However,there exists an arguement that people today prefer to help the struggling strangers,which reach my agreement.
6.0	As far as I'm concerned,the idea that people are willing to help others in a dilemma is out of a mentality called transpositional consideration,which means when people see others facing problems,they may probably replace themselves in that situation and think what they have to do and what they want.
9.0	As a result,the action of their assistance reflect the thought from their deep heart,that is,they long for others' help.
9.0	So it's not difficult to generalize the theory.
7.0	Imagine that when you are in most efforts during a group of people,and there is an opportunity to get promotion,would you think
3.0	Recently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people: which aspect influences you the most when it comes to a major purchase: your friend's or colleagues' recommendation, information from media, or saleman in the market?
3.0	Opinions vary from person to person.
3.0	Some people claim that recomendations from your freinds or colleagues will inluences you most, other people say that salesman in the market will influences you the most.
11.0	However, I would stand on their opposite side and I believe when it comes to a major purchase, the information from media will influence you the most.
12.0	My veiwpoints can be elaborated as follows.
4.0	Firstly, the recommendations from you friends or colleagues sometimes will be one-side.
8.0	The things which your friends or colleagues have already known at most of the time are your known things too, because your friends or colleagues are living in the same circumustances with you.
8.0	Their experience are same as yours, so their recommendations would be similar with you.
8.0	Thus, these recommendations would have less help.
8.0	For example, when I was in high school, I was facing the trouble of choosing piano.
8.0	I did not know which school I should choose and all of my freinds and classmates were science students.
8.0	All of them thought I should choose the Wuhan Conservertory School Of Music, and I also thought at that time.
8.0	After I went there, I found what I really want was QingHua University, I felt very regret and I should make decision by meself.
4.0	Secondly, the salesman in the market at most time will hide the bad side and only show you the good side.
8.0	As salesman, the just want to sell you their products and get your money.
8.0	So they hardly would tell you the bad aspect of their product and then if you listen to them, you would be easy to buy a very well product.
8.0	For example, last year I wanted to buy a computer and I just wanted to use it for study and work.
8.0	I went to the JieDaokou computer market and told my willing to the salesman.
8.0	They recommended a computer to me and I bought it.
8.0	However, it was broken just one month.
4.0	Admittedly, the information from media may be fake or wrong, but I think it can be overcome by viewing many website and contrasting them.
10.0	Therefore, you can find the result or answer what you really want and help you the most.
7.0	All in all, when it comes to a major purchase, the
3.0	Nowadays, young people find it difficult to get a great and decent job in the employment market.
3.0	So what is the employers pay more attention to?
12.0	Some people believe that we are supposed to develop the ability to relate well to people, as this is the magnificent quality in a future job, while I certainly agree with this opinion.
12.0	I am a passionate advocate of studying hard in school, because we can get excellent qualifications and ser In the first place, studing hard in school lays a foundation for our excellent qualifications.
8.0	As is know to all, it is necessary for everyone to possess impressive job skills, if we want to get a good job.
8.0	And the learning process in school definitely plays an indispensable role in the way to finding a decent job.
8.0	On the contrary, if we spend too much time on developing the ability to relate well to people, it will be likely that we are fail to pass exams in school, which is that last thing we want.
8.0	Madam Curie is a perfect example.
8.0	She was known for the discovery of radioactive elements and the owner of two Noble Prizes.
8.0	Since she studied so hard in school that she was an expert in her career------chemistry.
8.0	She was good at all kinds of properties of elements, which were crucial for her future sucess.
8.0	Therefore, a well school learner is inclined to be famous expert in the future.
6.0	In addition to that, we are expected to study hard in school to possess the quality of treating everything serious instead of relating well to people.
8.0	There exist so many things that do not relate to our job directly in our professional life, but are significant parts of our promotion and other important moments.
8.0	We are able to facilitate them, only if we take them seriouly, which can be obtained from our diligent attitude to our job in school.
8.0	For instance, my brother, Tom was famous for his diligence and hard- working in his college.
8.0	He brought these qualities to his work, arranging his own table logically and orderly, which impressed his boss a lot.
8.0	Therefore, he got many chances from his boss to present his talents in public.
8.0	So this serious attitude towards studying benefit us to succeed in a future job To put it into a nutshell, studying hard in school can help us get required qualifications and skills and develop a excellent habit of performing everything seriously, which contribute to our future success in our jobs.
3.0	When it comes to the topic of satisfactory of workers, it occurs to my mind immediately that working with different types of tasks is the distinction between workers and robots and it is also the source of satisfactory.
4.0	To start with, different types if tasks can cultivate more skills than similar tasks.
8.0	Different types always mean facing with different challenge in one day, and using skills in different aspects in a short time.
8.0	However, similar tasks mean doing the same things for the whole day, and the problem the workers meet is the same everyday, which is sure to lead to the result that the workers forget other skills and have no chance to learn new skills in their work.
8.0	Obviously, the former can make the life filled with challenge and chance, which can make the workers more satisfied.
4.0	Besides, different types of tasks can enrich worker's life but similiar tasks just make workers feel bored.
8.0	For example, my uncle is an officer who was asked to type all the day.
8.0	And he always complains he believes he is just like a robot.
8.0	It is true that only robots do the same things everyday and don't complain.
4.0	Thirdly, completing different types of tasks facilates the development of a sense of achievement, which can make workers satisfied with their work in return.
8.0	The less types of tasks a worker can complete, the easier the worker can be replaced by others.
8.0	This will result in the fear of workers that they will be afraid of losing their job all the time, let alone being satisfied to their work.
8.0	On the other hand, if they can see how valuable they show during completing many different types of tasks, they will get safety and get the achievement.
8.0	Naturely, they will be content with their work.
7.0	According to what I have mentioned above, it is obvious that workers are more satisfied when they h
3.0	Some parents offer their school-age children money for high grade they've got in school.
3.0	In my opinion, that is a good way to encourage the most of the student to work hard on their study.
3.0	So I am supporting this  suggerstion.
3.0	Also it engage some people who is poor or have a problem on paying school fee will get a chance to study with the others.
11.0	With this way to help people study is meanningful and health to a country.
4.0	To begin with, parents can just cut off the porket money from student, by telling them earn the money themselves.
8.0	Like give them a target to get the money from school.
8.0	This way can make people's avid to motivation.
8.0	After few times they will learn themselves automatically.
4.0	On the other hand, it can motivate some poor familly to get a chance to study with the others.
8.0	Maybe they can pay the school fee by using a wonderful result on study.
8.0	Also this kind of student in this situation will study much more harder than the other student.
8.0	That is good for a school or even the country.
4.0	The last but not least,this way is meanningful and healther than force student to study.
8.0	Because student notice knowledge may make them rich since beginning to study.
8.0	The different to the force to study is student will learn more positive and enjoyable.
8.0	The meanning of this is the first time that more people avid on study and knowledge.
8.0	Not just study and a exam after that with no thing for a student.
8.0	That is what make a country health when every student want to study as hard as they can to achieve higher grade.
1.0	In conclusion,this way to motivate student to study must be successful,meanningful and health to a country or city.
1.0	The world will get pay back after this student graduate.
12.0	In my opinion, I disagreen with this statement, parents shouldn't let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes, because they don't have ability to define what is right and what is worry, so parent need to teach them, so that children can understand if the student make a big mistake also is worrng thing and panrent just let them learn from it, the children may think the thing do is right and can't feel what is worry with it , they may do the same thing like this again and again until someone to tell the children the thing is worry, may be the children will understand and change the maind but most of them can't, until that time is too late for them.
10.0	For example my friend mike, he parents want he learn from the mistake in his young, once he stolen he mother money, mike parent didn't tell he was worried, and he didn't know neither, so he stolen again and again until he stolen almost one thousand dollor, he parnet tell taht is worry, Finally he change this bad hably.
7.0	Infact  children can learn little part from thee mistake and help them group up, but the most important is the parent lead them to undersatnd the mistake, because the parents is the best teacher for children, they will know what the problem the children will have and they will use them half of live experience to teach their own children,  mistake will solve easily,  the little mistake for people in adult or the senior is not nescessary but it happen in child, everything begin in the chilhood, is ddecide the the futher
7.0	so is very importan
3.0	As we know,most of time in a person's life is spent on the work.
11.0	It seems that people can not live without a job.
12.0	And it is a real question how people to organize their schedule.
12.0	Some may argue that doing similar tasks all day long is better,while others way think having different types of tasks to do is more satisfying.
11.0	In my opinion,I agree with the latter.
10.0	Here are some reasons.
5.0	Firstly,for workers themselves,doing such varias jobs is one of the best way to avoid becoming tired.
8.0	People always easily get bored of something after they keep doing it for a long sequent time without any break or chage,even though they pretty love such things.
8.0	Children always fall crazy when they first get their new toys,but after a while,those articles can only be seen in a box,seldom being touched again.
8.0	So changing seems essential  to workers whiling doing their job.
5.0	What's more ,for managers and boss in the company,it can benefit them when people have different types to do because this way can make the sufficient of workers.
9.0	Some people never feel dull while facing different tasks,making them more energetic and desire to finish more.
9.0	For example ,in such a situation,I usually think that work will change and desire to do more,always having lots of power.
0.0	By the way,although similar tasks means a relatively easier arragement for job,I don't think it is a good a idea.
0.0	Imagine a situatuion where lots of workers do the same tasks again and again,seeming having little energy and working like a machine,shouting for a break in their mind.
0.0	It is not a good result people want to get.
12.0	When faced with the topic of celebrities or idol influence, and especially when it comes to  the target group the prestigious people have influence on, some will hold the opinion that they will have much more impact on the teenagers and the youth not the middle-aged and elderly  people.
8.0	And others will contend the older people would focus more on the current trend which is brought by the people rising to fame.
8.0	I am confirmly in agreement by the statement that the celebrities are more   essential to yonger generations, which follows three reasons.
8.0	First, the younger generation need to find their life supervisor seting an example for their uncertain future.
8.0	In one way, the youth's life experience is relatively incomplicated than the older one.
8.0	Hence, once the celebtrties behave proplerly, the youth can stimulate them and regulate  themselves and set up a prospective objective for them to achieve.
8.0	For instance, my sister is her junior year in university.
8.0	Now she is engaged in her new schedule of go for further education of her mashine desion major after being inspired by her icon in related field.
8.0	Actually she was extremly anxious and didn't what to do in the furture and how to improve her drawing skills while there were enomous assignments awaiting for her.
8.0	So the people specializinf in a paticular career can help the confused youngers to find the sea lamp in the sea.
8.0	In another way what's more, the older people are lazy to change their attitude towards the world.
8.0	They odler generation have already formed their own conception about how to study, work and live in the current life.
8.0	They are less likely to be influenced by the celebrities.
8.0	And even they change, thier abitlity is limited by the family,work and thier age.
8.0	As is known to all, the young genera
3.0	As far as I'm concerned,offering small amount of money to the children who get high grade in school may not be a bad idea,which can usually motivate the children to study harder.
4.0	Most children are prone to get bored when they spend time studying in school day by day.
10.0	Thus,they need something to help them relieve themselves and stimulate them to be more hardworking.
4.0	I rember when I was in the primary school,my mom would prize me 10 yuan if I could get double full marks in the school's exams.
9.0	This measure indeed helped a lot since the money which I could use for games attracted me very much.
9.0	I put all my heart in studying and finally achieved to reach the goal for the prize.
4.0	However,I don't agree that a big deal of money should be given to the children because they don't really know how to arrange it and make it for good use.
10.0	So,just give a little when they do a good job and tell them how to use it is the best way I reckon.
3.0	I disagreed the statement.
3.0	In my opinion,relax by doing physical exercise is more important than by watching a movie or reading a book.
3.0	"A proverb which is ""Health is invaluable."" flashed into my mind the moment I have finished reading the question."
11.0	It is well known that physical exercise is a excellent way to keep healthy.
11.0	I am not said that movies or books is a bad way to relax ourselves.
11.0	This is the reasons.
6.0	First of all,movies is fake because it made by actor.
8.0	Directors decides all scene.
8.0	There are many movies we can watch in any month.
8.0	There are no sense to watch movies because it can not provide us nothing without funny.
8.0	Appart from this,reading book is a traditional way to relax us.
8.0	In the mordern years,people  like reading books in the Interent,which,is harmful to our health such as our eyes.
8.0	Books also make people rigid.
8.0	At last,doing physical exercise make it possible for people to be a strong man.we can relax ourselves farthest beacuse exercises consume our strength quickly.
8.0	Last but not least,exercise make us live more.
10.0	Form what has been said above,I can draw a conclusion without any difficulities that it is a good way for people to relax by doing physical exercise.
11.0	I am quite honored to have the chance to state my opinion.
12.0	Initially,i have to put forward my thought that i think this is a good idea.
10.0	The reason goes as follows:
4.0	First and foremost,in China,as a result of our heavy study, it is kind of difficult to have some spare time to earn our extra money,so in my opinion it is a good way that can provide us students with money.
8.0	Next,offering money when we have a good grade is quite an effective way to keep up our study enthusiasm and it is a way to show us that only if we make some progress will we be praised and highly appreciated.
8.0	Then,for those students who do not want to learn, it is also an exceedingly fantastic way to arouse their interest in learning.
8.0	Last but not least ,we students do not know much about our social,learning is a kind of way to make us know more about the fabulous world.
4.0	As far as i know,in American,some parents will pay for the students if they do some housework.
8.0	I think they are similar in some way.
8.0	Doing housework means he or she is brilliant in his or her social ability,but doing good in the exam also is to show their talents in learning,so their being awarded can be understood and studied.
8.0	Some people may think that will make students lazier and make them bad at living skills,but i think that is not the case.
8.0	If you worry about that ,you can just settle another rule that doing housework are also awarded.
4.0	However, every coin has two sides.
9.0	I have to admit it is not perfect.
9.0	But what i want to put forward here is that the bad side can cover the good sides,so all in all, i want to state that i think this acting is beneficial in general.
2.0	That is all.
12.0	Nowadays,there are more and more saying that parent should make decisions for the children,because the children do not have enough experiment to make the correct decisions,if they make mistakes,there will be some bad effects on them,which will lead to their failure in their lifves.
11.0	But in my opinion,I insist that it is good for children to make mistakes,and they can learn from it,and the reasons are listed as followd.
4.0	First,when children make mistakes,there will be a stronger memory.
9.0	Beacuse when children make mistakes,they need to find why they fail,they should try another way or correct their mistakes to get success,and in this way,they will learn from it, and the next time when they face the same problem,they will know how to do it,and they will not make the same mistakes again,beacuse they know what they should take care of and how to get rid of it.
9.0	But if their parents do not let them to make mistakes,maybe he will make the same mistakes.
4.0	Besides,if children have not make any mistakes,they will collapse when they fail.
8.0	For example,I have a good friend named July,she is a cute girl and her parents love her very much,they make all the dicisions for her,so she can slove her problem rapidly.
8.0	But when she graduate from the junior high school,she have to face the problem by herself,so when she failed in the first exam in the university,she collapsed,she did nothing but crying.
8.0	So I think,if she had made mistakes before,she would be more resistent to her failure,and she will try to slove the problem by herselves.
4.0	Last but not the least,when children is trying to slove their problems,it is also a good oppotunity for them to cultivate their ablilty of communicate and socialization.
9.0	When they try to tackle the barrier,maybe they can not do it by themselves and they have to turn to the another for help,they need to contact with others,and in this process,they should learn how to convey their thought so that the others could understand their problem more comprehensive,and they how the others could be willing to help them.
9.0	Only in this way could them gain experience from the problem,and I think it is the ablilties that really worth them to learn.
2.0	So that is why I think parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.
3.0	Recently, there is a heated discussion about young people's decision.
11.0	Some people believe that children's decisions can't influence their future of society as a whole, because they are young and less experience.
12.0	HOwever, others hold a dissimliar viewpoint that children's idea can influence their future.
11.0	As for me, I agree with the latter one.
12.0	My reasons and examples are listed as folloews.
5.0	One reason why I am in favor of my perspective is that young people always have some interesting ideas of application we used on our smart phones.
8.0	This is because young people are have creative ability, which makes them invented games, interenet or other things.
8.0	A good example of this is my brother.
8.0	When he played games on computure, he always think about to create his own game and people can played on their mobiles or television.
8.0	Therefore, his friend and he strated to create their own game.
8.0	Now I can see many people played his game, which is really successful.
8.0	As the example suggests, young people's ideas does change the world.
5.0	Another relevant reason used to support my opinion that young people's decisions are more valueable.
8.0	This is due to the fact that old people's thought was formalist, therefore young people's ideas will be worthly.
8.0	A typical illustration of this can be seen in my friends who want to choose anime for her major.
8.0	In our country, our ACG culture are developing.
8.0	Many young people are intereting with it.
8.0	But in old people's opiinion watching cartoon is wasting time.
8.0	They are not encourge theri children to study those kind of things.
8.0	Actually,we need more people to help and encourge anime culture.
8.0	The example in dicates that sometime young people'd ideas is better.
11.0	I agree that doing physical exercise to relax myself.
12.0	It is obvious that playing physical exercise make our body better than watching a move or reading a book.
12.0	If i feel tried when I finished my homework I always play tennis to make meself feel better.
12.0	And we will make friends with other when we doing physical exercise.
12.0	Group activities can make our life better .
8.0	Doing group activities can enlarge our social network because members in group s are more likely to become their new friends.
8.0	And the quality of our life can undoubtedlty benefit from new friendship.
8.0	The advantage of doing physical exercise does not only affect my current life as astudent but will also have strong implicantions for my future work and studies.
8.0	therefore I strongly recommend it.
6.0	on the other hand watching a movie or read a book will make us feel more tried.
8.0	Many young students lack sufficient self control.
8.0	Without proper guidance from parents they will develop bad habits.
8.0	The disadvantage of watching a movie does not apply t me but also many other members of the society.
8.0	Therefore I'm sure many people will recognize its obvious downside and agree with me.
3.0	Watching movies and televisions is an important means of entertainment of popularity, it's seems to be the choice to kill the night time for the majority of the people.
3.0	But movies and televisions' effect on the young people is a controversial topic that aroused continuous discussion.
11.0	In my point of view, the negative effects on the way young people behave outweigh the positive ones.
5.0	Primarily, some films and TV program's contents will expose the young people to some bad languages.
8.0	It is acknowledged that a large amount of movies contains lines of curse words to meet the requirement of being an essential part to tell the story.
8.0	But it is the youth that we are talking about, the crowd of man lack of capability to disguise the behavior is appropriate or not, so there is a huge risk that they will likely to imitate the roles in the show and catch up using the bad words, which is a surely impolite deed.
8.0	Take my little brother, Ted, a six-year-old boy, as an example, he loves to watch TV during spare time.
8.0	After watched some shows and movies with vague rated that includes words without manners, he began to use some inappropriate words in the arguments with families and friends, which is an intolerable behavior.
8.0	Thus, the movies and Television shows will do harm to young people's behavior since they will learn the impolite sentences from them.
5.0	Another detrimental effect that movies and TV does to the way young people behave is that they might be misguided to commit crimes.
8.0	Action movies are commonly the winner among all genres in the movie markets, and there are also plentiful contents about criminal stories on the cable networks.
8.0	The youths, mostly without stable mental status and the ability of independent thinking, will easily be obsessed with the violence and other illegal actions they see.
8.0	There was a news that a high school student was in prison because he tried to sell drugs after seeing the heated TV show, the Breaking Bad, a show about the drug business, which is a lively supporting evidence that the movies and televisions' contents might do some negative effects on the youths.
2.0	To sum up, because of the serious misleading effects they bring, I think movies and television do more harmful effect on the behaviors of young people.
3.0	As we known,every parent wants their children has good grade.
12.0	But not everyone knows how to do to excitate children get high mark.
12.0	So many parents in order to able their child to get it,they use money to encourage them.
12.0	I don't think it's a awful idea.
12.0	My friend's father uses this method to make his child to study hard.
8.0	The effect also very significant.
8.0	So i think it's great to use this method properly.
8.0	No matter what,too dependence this way only make child to catch benifit.
8.0	Instead of really loving learning.
8.0	What parents really have to do?
6.0	Learing to communicate with theri children,understand their children what they really like and dislike.
8.0	Don't be force they do they don't want to do.
8.0	Otherwise they would only not listen to your word.
8.0	Go back to first topic,parents should make their children get good grades  through other ways.
8.0	I think this is best idea.
3.0	In recent year, whether parents should offer their children money for each high grade becomes a relatively controversial problem.
3.0	Some individuals believe that parents are supposed not to reward each time.
11.0	As far as I'm concerned, I disagree.
11.0	I think it is positive for students to be provided money for high marks.
6.0	On the one hand, I think it is a motivation which encourages students to study hard.
8.0	It also represents a conception that if you work hard enough, you can get what you want.
8.0	My cousin is a good illustration.
8.0	There was some time that his parents decided to offer money for him to buy i-phone six if he got a high grade in final exam.
8.0	During that period, he did too much exercises and prepared a lot and even spent twice as much time as usual.
8.0	Finally, he made it.
8.0	This experiece also encourages me to try my best for everthing I would like    On the other hand, children could also learn financial management advance by getting extral money.
8.0	Children could have a totally different attitude money they achieve, comparing with pin money they get directly from parents.
8.0	Financial management includes the addition of inflow, the subtraction of outflow and the distribution of money to related purpose.
8.0	For example, I want to but a pet dog which deserves one thousand RMB.
8.0	I have to accumulate the variation of budget and the acutual cost.
1.0	Admittedly, it is clever to offer no money for students to some degrees, because the money could distort the attitudes of children for studies.
1.0	However, if the amount of money was relatively proper, this result could not happen.
3.0	Do you always do things  you like to do?
3.0	If you do, do you think you ignore things that you shoud do?
11.0	I always do things I like to do, but I do not think that I spend little time on things I should do.
11.0	Therefore, I disagree that people today spend too much time on things they like to do rather than they should do.
12.0	There is a couple of specific facets why I think in this way.
5.0	Initially, people today spend much time on things they like to do, and most of these things are also things they should do.
8.0	Nowadays people have chance to choose works that they like, so they always do things they like to do.
8.0	For example, my sister works in a international trade company because she likes speaking English and is willing to have connects with different people.
8.0	Her work is to communicate with foreigners, and that is what she likes.
8.0	Thereby, she does things she likes to do and enjoy it.
5.0	Moreover, today people know how to make things they should do the things they like to do through technology.
8.0	For instance, when I was in primary school the first time I had a touch with English, I disliked this foreign language.
8.0	However, if I wanted to get good grades, I had to learn it.
8.0	I spent this painful time for a lone time until my mother encouraged me to learn English with computer.
8.0	I saw a different side of English that our teacher had never shown.
8.0	I play fanscinating English games with my mother, and that help me recite words and improve my vocabulary.
8.0	After that I regard Engligh as my favorite language.
8.0	I do things I like to do.
2.0	Taking account of all factors mentioned above, we can safely arrive the conclusion that people spend on things they like to do and also take good care of things they should do.
3.0	Nowadays,more and more parents will provide their children with money if they get high grade in school.
12.0	Although it does bring about some advantages on children's confidence and proud,the drawbacks it produces are more apparent.
5.0	It's true that giving kids some money exerts on some benefits.
8.0	It can encourage children to work and study harder in school and get better grades.
8.0	In addition, it can also develop children's confidence and make them feel proud about themselves.
8.0	As a result, they become more active and competitive on their study.
5.0	However,the above-mentioned benefits don't mean that we can turn a blind eye to the disadvantages it brings about.
8.0	First,money for high mark can let kids connect study with money in their own mind.
8.0	This is really bad for their study.
8.0	Next,more money means more parent's expection,and this will give children much pressure on study.
8.0	What is more important lies in the fact that money will make the relationship between kids and parents become worse.
8.0	If a child much depends on the money that is given by parents,when parents don't meet their needs,they will hate their parents and even steal the money to satisfy themselves.
1.0	In conclusion,although giving children money for each high grade does bring some advantages,the drawbacks it exerts on are more obviously.
1.0	How to find a better method to encourage children to study harder is a urgent task for each parent to concern about.
3.0	These days, there were an interesting debate on the internet, should teachers paid more than doctors and lawyers.
3.0	Some people said that teachers deserved paid more than others.
11.0	But I have an opposite opinion.
11.0	I think doctors, lawyers or business leaders should paid more than teachers.
5.0	First, in our society, doctor  and lawyers do more important job than teachers.
8.0	Like doctor's job which is cure people.
8.0	Everyone want to have a healthy body.
8.0	Sometimes we ues some food diet, and sometimes we do exercise.
8.0	But what would we do when we were get some desease?
8.0	The only answer is go to the hospital, to ask the doctors.
8.0	For example, when I was 9, I have a lung's desease, my parents are teacher, but they teach math.
8.0	In that period, I was disappoint, beacuse I realized that my parents cannot do everything.
8.0	And in the hospital, doctor give me many help to through the problem.
8.0	It equals to save my life.
8.0	Nothing is more important than your life, and in our society, only doctor can help you to keep health.
8.0	It's a similar reason with the lawyers, they can give some advice to keep your justice on the court.
5.0	Secondly, unlike the doctors, lawyers or business leaders, teacher are easier to be.
8.0	Sometime they even don't need to trained many years.
8.0	However, doctors and lawyers they spend much time in there life to pass their lisence text to find job.
8.0	It is a same condition of business leaders, they pay lots of money to achive the goal, and sometime they cannot be success.
8.0	Therefore, teachers, expecially some unimportant subject, they can find a  job after they just be trained in few years.
8.0	Which is unfair to doctors and lawyers, if  teachers paid more than them.
1.0	To conclude, doctors, lawyers or business leaders are more important than teachers in our community.
1.0	Moreover, they pay more attention on there major than teachers in there life, and they are all export in our society.
12.0	When talks about gifts for kids who get good grades some parents think that parents offer their school-age chlidren money for high grade they get in school,while others disagree.
11.0	Both of them are right but I agree with the firest opinion.
6.0	First of all,this decision could encourage children work harder.
8.0	As a high school I don't have enough money to spend,if I get good grades that my parents give me lots of money I would be very happy.
8.0	I can stimulate me work harder,and I can buy the thngs I want.
8.0	Some people are frustrated when they get a gift they don't want.
8.0	Take my mother for examlpe,last year my father sent her a excellent watch but my mother didn't very happy because she didn't like the color of the chain.
1.0	Aother reason drives me to choose that is that it can help children to practice the ability of manage their money,which is useful to children.
1.0	During the method that giving money as a reward, chilren will have a chance to managetheir own money,which is benefit to their future.
10.0	For instance,my grandfather gave my father as a reward when he got good grades.
7.0	Then he got great success in managing money,know he live by managing
7.0	Admittedly, it's bad to give a lots of money to children,
11.0	In the contemporary society, people not only care about themselves and also pay attention to people who need helps or struggle their life.
11.0	The statement claim that people are more happy to help the struggling strangers.
11.0	And I believe that statement is very correct.
5.0	At first, most people have economic ability to help the struggling strangers than before.
8.0	In the past, people had to worry about their survival.
8.0	And people earned money very less to maintian a familiy's expenses.
8.0	However, in the contemporary society, the economy is develop fastly.
8.0	Compared with the past, people can earn more money.
8.0	And they don't only worry about how to survial, they have abilities to do another things, such as they can to invest, go traveling, donate money to others and so on.
8.0	For instance, in China, these is big boss named Li Kaifu, he has a lot of money.
8.0	And recent years, he love to give money to the struggling strangers to help them to set up their companies and creat new technology.
8.0	And in China, this phenomenon is more and more commonly.
8.0	So, today people have more ability to help the struggling people.
5.0	On the other hand, almost peopel are educated, the shcool and the society's publicity are encouraging people to help people who need help than in the past.
8.0	In today's society, people are willing to believe others and love to help strangers.
8.0	People think do a little things may be can give a lot of help to strangers.
8.0	Take my tutor for example, he always give some help to people who need help, especially the struggling strangers.
8.0	He think his money or his help is not big or very value, but maybe for a people who struggling is a big help and also is a grate support.
3.0	Nowadays, an increasing number of graduates facing job hunting seasons would wonder what kind of job they should do, or what kind of job would bring them more satisfaction while working, those works that consist of various sorts of tasks or those are similar and present more repetitiveness.
3.0	In my point of view, I prefer the previous kind mentiond above, for the reason that  First of all, doing diverse types of work contributes to efficiency ,which brings a sence of satisfaction.
3.0	Because people won't easily get tired when they are requently exposed to fresh things, then they can remain high efficiency.
3.0	This is quite close to a physical condition of our body.
3.0	If we have to raise and hold our harms up in the air, not long after that, we will definitely feel the musle nearly frozen and can't even pull back a bit, but when we move arms up and down, it would be more comfortable, So as to our brains foucusing on different tasks.
11.0	Brains facing new tasks will work faster, as a result, we would feel better.
6.0	Secondly, different works may mean better development.
8.0	This is also a source of job satisfaction.
8.0	In work places, most people prefer to be praised as capable person since it means they would obtain more opportunities in the future promotion competition.
8.0	However if someone is required  to do somilar tasks all day long, he can't learn something new from what he already knows.
8.0	In the competitive society now, this kind of single dimention person is not welcomed.
2.0	To conclude, people are more satisfied when they have diifferent types of tasks rather than repetitiv tasks.
11.0	Nowadays, the development of the times is faster, so it is more important to learn new things.
11.0	So a number of people, they may think older people still need to learn new things, because they also have to follow the pace of the times, they may have their own reason to support their opinion.
11.0	However, i think they do not need to learn new thing, because old thing are often the most useful at the most critical time and this is also the most basic thing, so the elderly can teach young peole.
5.0	Firstly, older people do not have to learn new things, because maybe old thing are often the most useful at the most critical time.
8.0	To be more specific, the current technology is very fancy, so some things look good but not necessarily useful, and the old thing will not make mistake.
8.0	So if you try to teach older people new things, they may contradict these things, and get mad with you.
8.0	For example, once i went camping with my friends in the wild, suddenly there was a heavy rain, the lighters were wet, and we were very cold, so there was mo way, but a friend learned form his grandfather how to use wood to get fire, so he saved us.
5.0	In addition, many new things have evolved from old things.
10.0	To be more specific, elderly can teach young people how to quickly learn these basic things, because the elderly have experience.
7.0	In the other hand, if young people learn to expore on their own, they may spend a lot of time, so it may lead to slow development in the wor
12.0	I disagree that people today are more wlling to help the struggling strangs.
8.0	Beacuse we are teenagers，we should be  helpful,In some ways,if you help some people who in the danger,the peope will thank for your help.
8.0	On the other hand, if you see some people needs help and you didn't help him.
8.0	Don't you feel sick in your heart?
8.0	In our daily life ,most of us have the experience of helping strangers ,like giving directions to a lost boy or giving our seat to an elderly lady on the bus.
8.0	What a great felling it is to see a smile on others face!
8.0	"As an old saying goes ""Giving roses to others and the lasting fragance will remain in your hand."""
8.0	Therefore,it is necessary to help others.
8.0	It is right to help others .
8.0	But it should be within our reach.
8.0	To sum up , wu should be ready to help others beacuse  it make us feel better and makes our society more harmonious.
8.0	However when it comes to strangers  ,we should be cautious in case we may put ourself into trouble by helping them.
8.0	All in all ,I thinkpeople today are mor willing
3.0	There is no denying that the primary responsibility of the government is to improve people's daily lives in any aspect.
3.0	However, when terrible economic crisis arrives, the government has to curb some expenditures to maintain the operation of the authorities and provide financial assistance to help people get over the difficulty.
3.0	Although library, police and public transportation are vital for civilan's life, I reckon the government is able to save up some money from libraries, bacause both police and public transportation play a crucial role in help the country survive the crisis.
4.0	First of all, police is able to ensure the security of the society and appease people's panic mind.
8.0	To be specific, economic crisis are supposed to bring about the increase in umemployment, which lead to more people have to find ways to sustain their families.
8.0	In this case, some of them are possible to commit crimes such as theft and robbery to earn money, which would cause massive chaos in the cities.
8.0	To address the problem, police stations would dispatch officers to tackle the crime and ensure the safety of the residents.
8.0	Only in this way, people would retrieve the hope of life gradually and recover from the crisis.
8.0	For example, in 1980s, Japan encountered a horrible economic crisis as the depreciation of Japanese currency.
8.0	To stablize the society, the government increase the police power to fight with the gangsters who were planning to take advantage of the crisis to gain profit.
8.0	As a result, as many crimical organizations were wept out from almost every streets, people gradually regain their resolutions to work hard for a better life without the disturbance of crimes.
4.0	Besides, public transportation enables people to save money to confront the economic crisis.
8.0	In most cases, the cost of taking public transportation is far less than that of driving private cars.
8.0	Furthermore, many families have to morgage or sell their cars to pay their debts.
8.0	Under such circumstance, public bus and subway would be the only way to commute.
8.0	Imagine if the public transportation is suspended because of lack of fund to maintain, plenty of people are likely to bankrupt or fail to support their family.
8.0	For instance, as economic crisis devastrated the US in 2008, California reinforced the expenditure of public transportation, allowing many workers and white collars to release their financial pressure and help them get out of the crisis.
4.0	Admittedly, libraries are the center of knowledge and deserve massive investments.
8.0	However, libraries have little, if any, positive impact on the recovery of the economic crisis.
8.0	Moreover, many citizens are urge to earn money and look for job to make a living.
8.0	In other words, most of them are not in the mood for reading novels and newspaper in the library.
8.0	Plus, maintaining the present libraries does not require a huge number of expenditures.
8.0	As a result, it is feasible to cut down the expendure on the libraries.
2.0	To sum up, police and public transportation are too important to recover the economic.
12.0	I think this is a good idea.
8.0	First,it can make their school-age children have energe to study.
8.0	For us student,study is obviously less interesting than playing,so money can let students spend more time on studying.
8.0	If their children want to get the money,they should study hard,then they will learn more.
8.0	Second,giving their money can help them know how to deal with them.
8.0	I think if their parents teach them how to use the money,they will know importance of keeping money and will not use the money in wrong ways.
8.0	Finally,in my opinion,if parents can do this correctly,giving money as presents could become a good idea to encourage their kids to study hard and get high grade.
3.0	Nowadays, many people think that the rules for young people are applicable.
11.0	There are many reason why they think so: The rules ensure the young's safety and let them grow up healthily.
3.0	They also think that what youths can do are limited by rules and it is easier for parents to educate their kids.
12.0	However, I think the rules are too strict for young people to obey.
5.0	First, the young cannot earn money themselves because of the rules.
8.0	This leds to their dependence on their parents and aasking for reward without any effort.
8.0	Youths will ask the parents for money and think it easy to make money.
8.0	It is also possible that they even pay the bill that their family cannot afford.
8.0	And also, what if the family rely on the youny to support?
8.0	If the kids obey the rule not to work, who earn money to support their sick grandparents?
8.0	This rule seems not so suitable to youths.
5.0	Furthermore, driving is not allowed if the young are under 18 years old.
8.0	It's not a good rule because young people always want to hang out with friends and it is not convenient if they cannot drive.
8.0	The buses are safe, however, some children take taxi on their own in order to save time, which may set themselves in danger.
8.0	Some youths' riding bikes is not that safe as they thought.
8.0	Besides, why the youths cannot  drive if they get the lisence?
8.0	It is unfair.
10.0	I
12.0	I think it's a good idea for parents to praise children for their higher marks in the form of offering money.
11.0	The reasons are as follows.
4.0	Firstly, parents should offer prize to their children if they progress in studying, because children need encouragement and motivation.
8.0	A student may lost passion when they gain good results but find the results mean nothing.
8.0	Giving them prize is telling them that they have done a great job, and telling them that their hardwork and progress mean a lot.
8.0	Once they get encouraged, they feel what they do is worthwile.
8.0	Also, prizes can serve as a motivation, and can stimulate students to get another prize next time.
8.0	Then they will make effort to learn in order to win this honor.
4.0	Secondly, as school-aged children, they don't have source of money, and desire to have more.
10.0	So if the prize is cash, they will cherish it and will have a stronger motivation to learn.
4.0	Thirdly, cash can be useful for students than other prizes.
8.0	When giving children money for high grades, parents should ask their children what the cash will be used for.
8.0	In this way, parents can lead their children to have a clear view on money management.
8.0	For example, if the student want the money to learn an instrument, but the prize for each high score is not enough to buy one, then parents can tell them to save money they gained, and make economic plans for learning an instrument.
3.0	What do you think will happen if you repeat same movements for an hour?
3.0	What about 4 hours?
3.0	And even a whole day?
8.0	If you will get superemly exhausted and absolutly bored, you may hold the same opinion with me.
8.0	In other words, I believe that doing various tasks during the workday is more satisfying for workers than doing silimar tasks all day.
8.0	Handling diverponous tasks result in the stimulation with respect to workers' interests and willingness of their work as well as the improvment of workers' abilities in addressing problems.
5.0	First of all, doing diverse assignments can arouse workers' willingness and interests of work.
8.0	Most of workers today are doing boring matters requiring little intelligence and knowledge, which may cause the decrease of their passion and expectation of their careers.
8.0	However, the diversity types of their tasks could stimulate their active minds and make them feel fresh.
8.0	From my own experience, once I did Maths assignments for all day long, my correct rates and my productivity decreasing rapidly.
8.0	However, when I accomplishing assignments of various subjects, I made less mistakes and finish them quicklier.
5.0	Secondly, dealing with different kinds of projects may lead to the development of workers' capability conprehensivly.
9.0	When coping with one kind of problem, workers could only exercise and being familiar with this specific type of ability, yet they can absorb a large amount of methods and techniques while facing different problems.
9.0	In this way, the factory's productivity could be enhance so that workers could get more profits.
10.0	Although tackling similar matters for a whole day could decrease the obstacle of work and make it easier for workers to apply one technique better, handling various type of tasks outweighs the other.
10.0	All in all, I bel
11.0	From my point of view, I think this is a good idea that parents should offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.
11.0	Althought offer money by getting high mark is very venality ,it also a good way to educate children that if you want to gain more, you should pay more.
11.0	The student will be more hardworking in their study that they could gain lots of money by getting high marks.
10.0	And it also could teach them the money is hard to gain and learn them why should they have to cherish the money which is gained from their parents.
5.0	Further, children now are usually  have great pressure from their school and family.
8.0	If use this way to increase the their deviser of economy, the same will increase their passion.
8.0	Not only parents want their children get high mark in school, but also offer a power to let them advance.
8.0	It is a way to lead the children do not lose their movement in such enormous stress from these society.
5.0	Moreover, parents offer their school-age children money such as reward to pay for their endeavor and encourage them to establish a mental to save money without costing it in many meaningless ways.
9.0	It could increase the knowledge of children's financial mind that told them how to use or plan the money's value in maximum.
9.0	Also, children could increse their math ability that they measure the money's daily cost.
10.0	For the reason above that is why
12.0	I don't agree with this,because I think students should be given more time to study by themselveses.
12.0	On one hand,when students working together,they always try to make other people belive their explaination.
12.0	It will cause many disagreement and also much unhappyness,on the other hand,studying by oneself is a great way to examine themselves.
6.0	When students study along,they will find more questions.
9.0	If there aren't patners who can offer help,they will seek help from their teachers.
9.0	So,the other benefits you can get from study along is the good relationships between you and your teachers.
3.0	Recently, a controversal topic has arouse a heat debate among the public: whether the governments should improve the safety by hiring more police or improve the appearance by improving the old buildings and streets.
3.0	Oponion vary from people to people, some are inclined to disagree it.
3.0	While according to my exprience and preference, I support the government hires more police or improve the appearance to attract more tourists.
5.0	First of all.
8.0	Lacking of the safety will cause some dangerous accidents which will stop the increasing of tourists.
8.0	This is primarily becasue if there is not amounts of police, the numbers of comminals who want to rob tourists will increase.
8.0	With the events of bad things happened and the spread of bad side affect, the people will not choose to travel in this city and the number of tourists will decline.
8.0	For example, my town once had a lot of travel points and there were lots of people choose to have a trip in our town every years so do the robbers.
8.0	But the governments did hire more police to protect the tourists.
8.0	With some people be rodded in my town, the other people did not dare to have a travel in my city anymore.
5.0	What is more, if the governments improve the old buildings and streets it will made tourists comfortable.
8.0	It is largely since the transportation will not be crowded with a wider street and the old building is more attractive than before.
8.0	So the tourists will not experience a traffic jam and the old building is so advenced that spice up the experince of tourists.
8.0	For instance, my old town always had a traffic jam, which disturb the mood of tourists who spended most of time on the road.
8.0	And the old building made my town look like a developing city which disappointed the tourists.
7.0	To put in to a nutshell, I support that idea because
3.0	Nowadays,people are always stressed out and everyone is burdened with various difficulties,such as work pressure,study difficulties and financial dilemma.
3.0	Therefore,how to relax ourselves in such a quick-pace society has become a hot debate recently.
3.0	Some people believe that watching a movie or reading a book is a good way to get refreshed but other people prefer to do physical exercise.
11.0	As for me,I would like to choose the former because I think it is better for relaxing than exercise.
4.0	The first reason that I make the choose is that among all the entertainment,I like films and books the best.
8.0	I am always impressed by the beautiful lines in diffirent kinds of films and the impressive words in novels and poems.
8.0	When I feel tired or anxious for daily pressure,I will spend one or two hours watching a movie or reading some stories just for fun and relaxing.
8.0	When I really go into the screen,I will forget what I am worried about just now and totally get refreshed.
4.0	What is more,enjoying movies and books makes people think nothing but the beautiful stories on the screen or paper and thus their worries can be thrown out of their heart.
9.0	While doing exercise,one's brain is blank and filled with nothing and maybe he or she cannot stop to think over the difficulties he or she is faced with,which leads to more and more anxiety.
9.0	But by watch or read something,his or her brain and heart are taken up by the moving scenes or some interesting phrases,which exiles all the pressure out.
4.0	In addition,some pressure comes from the physical tireness and in this case,it is not a good idea to do some exercise.
8.0	Obviously,a film of a interesing book will be much better.
8.0	Some people take several hours in commuting and they spare a lot of time and energy on transportation.
8.0	For them,when they go back to home after work or study,they have no time and energy to exercise.
8.0	But watching a movie or read something is another story.
8.0	This kind of relaxing need nothing but one's eyes.
8.0	What they need to do is just finding a comfortable position and enjoy the stories!
8.0	Even for some special jobs,such as porters,how can you imagine them to spend time doing exercise for refreshment?
2.0	For my personal preference,the advantege of watching movies or reading books in reducing pressure and the weakness of exercise in physical condition,I firmly believe that compared with physical exercise,it is better to reduce burden and relax oneself by watching films or reading books.
3.0	Recently, the parents uasually concern about the grade of their children and continously find a way to encorage their children to promote their marks.
3.0	Some parents have a idea that provide money for their childrn if they get a high grade in the school.
12.0	Grantly speaking, it partly works, however it have potential disadvantages.
4.0	The additional money provide can be a driving for childrens.
8.0	By this I mean, not every one have a strong motivation to immense their self to study.
8.0	However, the efficiency and the enthusiasm is decided by the strength of the driving.
8.0	if the parents offer money for their children when they have a great grade, as a result, the children can aim for the finacial encouragement, that means they can have enthusiasm to manage the dull studing work which thwy consider before.
4.0	however, the negative effects is evitable.
8.0	Firstly, the potential risk is that when parents decide to stop this kind of encoragement, the children may not make effort on study anymore.
8.0	In this case the motivation of the children is the finacial reward.
8.0	the brains of they would naturally connect the study with the money as a integrety.
8.0	if their parents change their idea and not provide the money, those connection break and the children would lose the only reason of study.
4.0	In addition, the money offered indicate that the parents force thier children to concentrate themselves in stading only.
8.0	it meas the parents only care about the grade of the children and ignore other kind of need of the students.
8.0	for instance, a student who love the craftwork but his parents tell him if you can get a good grade, they will provide extra mony for him.
8.0	Consequently, child may be attracted by financial reward and give up the habit which he actually like.
2.0	To sum up, the parents should not offer finacial rewrard if their children get good grades
3.0	It is universally acknowledge that various technologies such as cell phone, online games, and social networking website paly an indispensable role on students' daily lifes.
3.0	However some people assert that children nowadays are more difficult because of technologies applications mentioned above, but from my perspective, I disagree with this arguement for children can actually take advantages of  the high-technologies to enhance their study.
4.0	First and foremost, compared to the past, at present cell phones and devices like ipad creat a good effect on children's study.
8.0	For instance, children on China learned new English words in textbook without audio format, which led to the problem- children could not pronounce the words correct, and often made mistakes when giving speaks in public.
8.0	While today, cell phones facilitate children to learn English by playing standard English record, so they can imitate the native speaker's voice through audio files in cell phones.
8.0	As a result, there are more children today can learn English by themeselves and makes educating children much easier than before.
4.0	Furthermore, playing online games can stimulate children's creativities with proper supervise.
9.0	It is true that addicted to inline games may result in failures in study, but with proper control by children's parents, children can discover new things in the virtual world, and in online games, children are assigned to different tasks, only they cooperate well with other players can they get the final success.
9.0	From this experience, children can not only gain ful butfillment but also learn the team work spiritual.
4.0	Lastly, contrast to the past, thanks to the social networking, children ahve ability to get to know people from everywhere in the world, and share experience, feelings with other people, which in turn expand children's horizen.
9.0	On top of that, websites like linkened, facebook equip children ability to  build their own networkings.
9.0	Networking is a important resourese when later they enter in the world.
7.0	If they can expose to these
3.0	I support that it is more significant for the goverments to use fund to improve public transportation than to improve Internet access.
3.0	First of all, what matters in the human society is the real contacting of each other.
3.0	When we talk to our family members, we hope that we can tough them, we can hug, and we can laugh together, not just say some words online.
11.0	That can only be achieved in meeting someone in reality.
11.0	So we need the public transportation to get to somewhere.
12.0	I have to admit that it is convinnient to chat in the internet.
10.0	However, there is no warm.
6.0	In addition, there are severe problems waiting to be solved in the public transportation in our country.
8.0	Every festival, there is a traffic jam in the street, and buses are always extremely crowded.
8.0	For instance, in the last Spring Festival, I prepared all the things in good mood and wanted to take the bus to the train station.
8.0	Although it costed me a lot of time to purchase the ticket of the train because there were not enough seats for the passangers, what suprised me more is that all the buses are filled with people.
8.0	Therefore, I strongly insist that it can't be wait to improve the routes of the buses, fix the broken road, and update the speeding machine of the buses.
8.0	These measures all need the money.
1.0	Last but not least, individuals need to go out and have a look of natural environments in the current society, especially internet can not figure out everything for you.
1.0	There is no doubt that people can be lazy naturally.
8.0	They refuse to move to avoid the matters, and think it can save the money and time.
8.0	Actually, it's harmful to their health and mood.
8.0	They need go out to look around.
8.0	That's the significance of the public transportation.
3.0	When I was in the senior high school, our teachers always told us something about our society and political views.
3.0	And them help us to close the real society and expend our horizon.
3.0	Therefore, I think teachers should make thir social or political views known to students in the classroom.
11.0	Moreover, there are two more spercific reason why I think in this way.
5.0	Initially, I think teachers' social or political views are almost right and can help us to get close and familiar to the society, which we need to get in sooner or later.
8.0	And when we know more about this society, we will become more calm when we work in the society.
8.0	"For instance, My sister said "" Thanks for my teachers' political views, I was major in English in university and now I get a perfect work."
8.0	"And the country make a policy about my work and then I get a chance to finish my further study abroad"" Now because of the teachers' political views, my sister can get a good job and have more privilage."
8.0	Therefore, the teacher's political views can help us to choose our major and get good chances.
5.0	Moreover, I think we can get imformation about the society from teachers' views, and wecan use them when we talk with elders such as grandparents.
8.0	That will help us maintain our relationship.
8.0	For example, my teacher told us that our sociey develops dramatically.
8.0	From the military technology, we have more powerful missile.
1.0	Even though sometimes teachers will transfer their wrong view of the society, I still think we can get close to the realistic word and make our own future plan.
1.0	Taking account of the factors mentioned above, we can safely arrive the conclusion that it is beneficial for us to get teachers' social or political views in the classroom.
3.0	The issue that whether famous people have more influence on youngesters or senior citizens is highly debatebale.
11.0	And the fact is that there are a lot of people support that famous celebrities are more significant to young adult.
12.0	As far as I am concerned, as long as celebrities, whether famous entertainers or athletes, are ambitious, modest and hard working , they can play a role in both young residents and old residents.
5.0	One the one hand, celebrities do make a big differnce on young adults life.
8.0	As we all konw, many younger people especially teenagers in university or graduates who just step into the society are not really mature, sometimes they are more emotional than rational so that they can not distinguish between rights and wrongs..
8.0	Most of them are big fans of celebrities.
8.0	And they are easy to be affected by their idols as the more they appreciate the celebrity, the more they will imitate the celebity's behavior.
8.0	That's why choosing a suitable idol is especially crucial.
8.0	And I still remember one of my best friends in university.
8.0	When we were freshman, she liked Jay Zhou so much that she had known almost everything about Jay Zhou.
8.0	In her spare time, She would listen to Jay Zhou's music over and over again.
8.0	Apart from that, she would also spent a lot of time collecting information about Jay Zhou , like his childhood or the background and experience of his music.
8.0	But one thing was clear, she was not the person who just paid attention to exterior things, she would dig out sometging more special.
8.0	As we all know, Jay Zhou really suffered a lot during his music carrer, and he made it.
8.0	This spirit inspired my friend to keep calm and go on all the time.
8.0	Under the influence of Jay Zhou, my friend kept better herserlf all the time and will never give up without trying.
8.0	This is really amazing.
8.0	Although we , young adults like to Chase the star, but if the star set a good example for us, why not we consider it as beneficial and support it.
5.0	On the other hand, celebrities with high reputation should also gain respect from old people and maybe old people could learn from them.
8.0	Whe it comes to vitues ,there is no gap between  young adults and old adults.
8.0	In fact, it is often misunderstood that old people are too arrogant and self-confident about their experience to admire celebrities.
8.0	As they may believe themselves more.
8.0	However, I have to say, my grandmother who is over 80 years old also admire the successful sportsman Sun Yang very much.
8.0	She knows that Sun Yang does a great amount of exercise to gain his achievement and he tries again and again.
8.0	Sun Yang is the person my grandmother respect a lot.
8.0	It has nothing to do with the age, if you think something is right or you think someone is fabulous, then you will follow her or him to better yourself.
8.0	We should not hold the wrong idea that old people do not like celebrities at all, they just focus on themselves.
8.0	In fact, if the person, no matter how old he or she is, set a good example, old adults will see it and they will impart this spirit to their familities which is beneficial.
10.0	sO IT IS
3.0	Through history,education play a important part of society.
3.0	Rencently, there have made a lof of discusiion about ideas that giving prize to high ranked students.
3.0	Some people think the school should support enough prize to students.
3.0	I my poing of view, contends that hard worked and high grader students deserve get some awards.
3.0	By giving their prize can make more students to have passion to study and working.
11.0	There is no doubt that,more sudents glad to working will make our future more proprous.
5.0	Firstly, the money is always so predcious for alomst students.
8.0	Because a students dosen't have regular income,that means  they dose not have the finical ability.
8.0	But we all konw that,be a teen always have different kind of thought.
8.0	So that,they always want to gain many things that they are interested.
8.0	So if parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade can achieve them support for material demand。While the children overcome some difficulties by themselves it normal to give them some gift to make them keep hard-working.
8.0	Last summer,I have a presentation in my school.
8.0	But I am not a people who clever and outgoing.
8.0	But I still try my hard to improve my improvsation skills and spend much time in practise.
8.0	After presentation ,I win the competition and enrich my knowledge.
8.0	Them my parent gave me a gift that my favourite novel！
8.0	In addition,it also make me feel more confidence and happy to face difficulties in the future.
5.0	Secondly, another reason is that the compete to earn this prize prepare students to living in society at future.
8.0	After finishing school and university, they must enter to society and in it there are different kinds of competitior for get chance and money.
8.0	This task help them know how toachieve their goal.
8.0	In society,there are boundless problems and studentsmust have enough impetus to achieve their goal.
0.0	In a word, give children their money for each gard they get in school can help them grow and improve them management skills.
0.0	It's effective for childern to realize and enter society easily.
0.0	On the top of that,it's a benifical way to improve scientic level of students and incentive to try more for their dream.
0.0	All in all,it's recommened further survey to be conducted to asses long term effect to children!
3.0	Because of the new fassion trend,lots of parents want to help their children to get higher mark by some methods.
11.0	Then some parents come up with an idea which is to use the pocket money to enhance children's willing to study well.
11.0	I reckon this new method is a good one.
12.0	Here are my perspectives below.
5.0	Initially,if parents give the money to their children bacause they get high marks,children will have the aspiration to study hard to earn the awards again.
8.0	As a child,he or she can use the money to buy things that he or she likes and do not have to depend on his or her parents.
8.0	This way can help kids develop more independent.
8.0	Also kids can enjoy the happiness that the money gives to them.
8.0	Money as a reward contributes the relaxation of the children.
8.0	Since they study hard and do not have any spare time for the recreation.
8.0	They can utilize the money for shopping or other games shopping.
5.0	Secondly,this new trend can help their children develop a new skill--money management.
8.0	Since they have to face the society someday,they need to master this ability for their future lives.
8.0	For example,lots of adults do not know the money management,therefore,they lost their money by ventures,deceiving,large consumption and other things.
8.0	Hence,this new method can let children manage their money to avoid the things happened that mentioned above.
0.0	Eventually,this new method brings lots of advantages to the parents and the students.
0.0	For instance,parents do not have to worry about their kids about the study because they will fight for their pocket money.
0.0	Simultaneously,the kids can improve their marks and enhance their capability of study.
0.0	This new way is a win-win idea.
0.0	Not only students can benefit,but also the parents.
12.0	Today lots of children like to tsay at home play vedio game and not cost time on their communities, but sometime it may be are not right.
11.0	In my opinion young people today should use mor time to help their communities.
11.0	And it can make them better when they talk with other.
4.0	When young people helping thier communities they can lean more social experence, and they can learn when they talk with different people.
9.0	But some young people dosen't like go out to talk with other, for me it is a bad situationn.
9.0	If a young people do not give enough time to helping their communities they will never learn who to join society, it is a bad things when they join to the work or when they doing bussiness.
4.0	And when young people cost more time to helping their communities they can make more friends and they can cost there time on something meanfull.
9.0	When they make more friends they will have more people who can help them in the future, and young people also can learn more things when they talk with friends.
9.0	Is much better to stay at home.
4.0	However it is ture to stay home is more save than go out to communicate with other, but for everyone we finally have a day have to go out and talkwith everyone we have to, it is a good things to learn those thing when we was young.
10.0	Such as my brother, he alway cost lot of time on helping his communities, and have a day he got a wonderfull job from his friend.
1.0	I really hope those young people who do not give their time to help their communities to go out and talk more with people, it must have some benifit.
1.0	at lest it is my opinion.
12.0	I think it is a perfect way to relax by watching a movie or reading a book other than dong physical exercise.
11.0	From my perspectives,there are three reasons.
11.0	First,I can learn a lot of knowledge of costum of different countries,given the fact that I have an favor for watching American and European movies which bear many local people's daily lives,ways to live and most of all,love for lives.
6.0	Second,it is high time that I learn English,which can be partly done by watching an English movies or reading an English book that contains countless native expressions.
8.0	When I was in primary school,I hated English,I hated English teachers,I hated Englishman and I even hated the classmate who is good at English.
8.0	There is only one reason for that:I can not get a good mark in English exams for the various even unknown words and expressions.
8.0	Then,one day,a relative introduce me an trick to learn English well and easily;that is to read English cartoon books.
8.0	It did work.
8.0	From then on,every time feel tired,I would read a cartoon book,which lifted me out of the depression and tireness and most of all,improved my English .
1.0	Last but not least,wachting a movie and reading a book are far more cozier than doing physical exercise on account of the feeling of tired after physical exercise.
1.0	To summary,I perfer to relaxing by watching a movie and reading a book to relaxing by doing physical exercise.
3.0	As the culture and technology develops, life is become more and more complex and confused.
11.0	Some people always bemused in this society and don't know what to do.
11.0	So, some people claim that it is essential for young people to have the ability to plan and organize.
11.0	As far as I concerned, I strongly believe in this point of view that ability to plan and organize is of great importance for us to live on this complicated world.
5.0	Firstly, planning and organized ability can make us effective.
8.0	One of the reason for why the modern life is complex is we have more stuff to concern about now.
8.0	Don't like ancient people, we have to do more than subsist, plentful activities verify our life.
8.0	So we have much stuff to deal with everyday.
8.0	Clear plan can manage out life well in order to avoid waste of time.
8.0	For example, when I was in junior school, I almost cannot finish my daily homework because there are too many subjects.
8.0	What I did to with this is to make a plan for homework.
8.0	Like I spend half hour in English, 40 minutes on Math.
8.0	After I had my specific plan, I could finish my work well.
8.0	So it's apparent that planning and organized ability can improve out effectiveness.
5.0	Secondly, emergency can be resolved by our ability to plan and organize.
8.0	By the Internet, we can communicate with people easily and instantly, which means we would always meet some occasional situations or emergency.
8.0	Sometime even a seccesion of events happen at the same time.
8.0	So the ablity to plan and organize is essential to deal that.
8.0	To demostrate, once I was in home, my wife called me that her car was out of gas and stopped on the road, and at the sane time, my friend called me that his computer didn't work and wanted me to help.
8.0	So I organized it well and eal with both or their problems on time.
8.0	So, ability to plan and organize is really essential now.
2.0	To conclusion, the ability to plan and organize is essential to our daily life because we need it to effectively cope with daily affair and handle with emergency that we might meet in our life.
3.0	Today, society has been greatly improved by technologies, while the pressure on people is increased at the same time.
11.0	Different people will turn to different ways to relax themselves.
12.0	Two of these ways are watching a movie or reading a book and doing physical exercise, which are the most popular ones.
12.0	In my opinion, watching a movie or reading a book is the better one.
4.0	First of all, movies and books have an extremely large number.
8.0	Under different circumstances, people always can find the ones they want.
8.0	For example, you can read some books about other people's successful methods to solve the problems you are facing.
8.0	This methods are not be taught to when doing exercise, except that you want to improve your PE results.
4.0	Secondly, when watching or reading you are in a quite quiet situation.
8.0	Such situation cannot be got during your exercise time.
8.0	Exercise means that you have to be activitive and be exposed to a noisy place even if you do execise on your own.
8.0	Noise disturb you so that it is impossible to think of your difficulties.
8.0	You just forget them temporarily but the loss of time is permanent.
8.0	Thus movies and books may be the good helpers.
4.0	Last but not least, you can watch movies and read books whenever you want.
8.0	You cannot run in rainy days, or you have to find a gym and pay for your exercise.
8.0	By comparison, movies and books will even pay for your time uesd in them.
8.0	They offer  people the invisible wealth, like knowledge, wisdom and so on.
0.0	That's why I choose movies and books when it comes to relax.
0.0	Of course, we should select correct ones before we use time on them.
0.0	After seleting, here comes joy.
0.0	People will fall in love with this way.
3.0	The passed two decades have witnessed that our country's economy is booming.
3.0	With the accumulating of wealth, a question has aroused our attention among people---should children be praised by money when they perform well in school examinations?
3.0	Answers vary from one person to another.
11.0	As for me, being a girl who supports the quality-oriented education, I vote for that we should not use money to express our satisfaction and encouragement.
5.0	Firstly, children's characters are greatly molded by parents' education methods.
8.0	If parents put too much emphasis on their scores on paper and offer economical stimulus to them, it can be inferred that children will regard scores as a vital part in their life and neglect other significant qualities.
8.0	That's too partial.
8.0	I have read an article written by a professor who graduated from the UCB, in which she wrote that her son did weakly in exams in school but never be blamed for it by parents.
8.0	On the contrary, his confidence was well constructed in his childhood, as she often praised her son for some progresses in life, such as being careful when crossing streers, remembering parent's birthdays, and offering help to classmates and so on.
8.0	Maybe her son wasn't proficient in any cricullum in school, but he must be a nice guy in the future.
8.0	As it is acknowledged that no one can deny the value of study, for only when you can lay a good fundation in school, can you make more progress  in further study and construct your own career.
8.0	Nonetheless, it is overemphasized now.
5.0	In addition, with little self-discipline and little experience in managing their wealth, children should not be given money as bonus even though they do well in school.
8.0	How to deal with money is an abstract lesson which should be paid enough attention to.
8.0	It's widely deemed that attaining an unimaginable fortune may be a catastrophe when someone hasn't be prepared quite well for it.
8.0	An appalling report I have read from a newspaper said that, the majority of lucky people who won trillions of money from a sudden coincidence have suffered from many disasters.
8.0	The reason why they were so depressed now was lack of self-discipline and professional knowledge of managing wealth.
8.0	Thus they may go to waste their sudden fortune and buy exessive luxuries which are not necessary  Finally, they were living in despair and poverty, even debt.
8.0	Consequencely, I think children should not be given money when they are not mature enough to assigh their money rationally, instead of paying for computer games.
0.0	Admittedly, children given money can be rational and have chance to promote an awareness of economy.
0.0	Nevertheless, I think it has too many risks that we cannot control well.
0.0	In a nutshell, I strongly think we should not use money to express our satisfaction and encouragement.
0.0	On the other hand, we should fin
3.0	All parents in the world love their children deeply and look foward to their children's growth and success.
3.0	However, how to educate and cultivate our children puzzles many people.
3.0	A lot of parents are very likely to misunderstand this kind of love and spoil our children.
3.0	I have seen many parents and grandparents spoil and ruin their children by never let them make any mistakes.
11.0	In my opinion, making mistakes plays  a significant role in a child's grow.
10.0	And as parents, our duty is to lead our children how to learn from making mistakes instead of avoiding them from making mistakes.
6.0	I remenber two things in my life tought me the value of making mistake.
8.0	First thing happens in my childhood.
8.0	At that times, I was about 14 years old and I felt curious about my schoolmates' smoking and drinking.
8.0	Then I told my father that I wanted to have a try.
8.0	At first my father diagreed my suggestion and said that it was inappropriate for children to  do so.
8.0	But I still felt eager to do so.
8.0	"I wondered."""
8.0	How does it feel?
8.0	"It is as cool and comfortable as we see?"""
8.0	In a evening when I came back home, my father handed me a bottle of wine and a ciga.
8.0	He said that I could have a try as long as I did not care about having a terrible lung and a weak stomach in the rest of my life.
8.0	Then I drank a little and smoke the ciga, the fact was that I found that it felt not as good as I saw other people do.
8.0	And I never try that again from then on.
8.0	If my father did not allow me to try to make the mistake, I might go and learn with my schoolmates.
8.0	From this experience, I learned that sometimes parents' permission for children to make mistakes cna lead to a good result.
0.0	The second thing also happened in that curious age.
0.0	I wondered why people cannot steel money.
0.0	Then I asked my mother about this question.
8.0	She said that it was because you would feel bad about it and it might lead to serious  results.
8.0	Then she brought me to one of her friends' store and let me have a try.
8.0	I tried to steel one stuff from the store and avoiding being looked by the employees.
7.0	I gave up later because during the whole process I felt very terrible and determined to lead a life
3.0	When ask about watching movie and sport which one is best choice for relax, different people have different answers.
3.0	An inmeasurable number of people who maintain the standpoint that whatching movie or reading book are bet way to relax, because movie and book is more intresting.
11.0	I partly agree with it.
11.0	Howevery, as far as I am concern relax by doing physical exercise is best choice, because the sport can make you health and happy, it also can help you make new friend.
6.0	The first reason to support my standpoint is that a reserch about which way you like for relax.
8.0	the 49.89%people like relax by watching or reading.
8.0	they believe book and movie can tell you a store, and you can explore in the unreal world, then you can learn a lot of knowledge.
8.0	The 51.13% people think sport is best way to relax, because the sport make you health, the health is most important thing in your life.
8.0	And it can make you happy, you will forget the bad thing when you doing some sports.
2.0	Adimddetly, reading book or watching movie is very intresting, you can know many thing you never know before.
10.0	The many people can use the knowledge in they life.
7.0	But I think the most inportant thing for relax is happy, reading and watching is intresti
3.0	As we all know, some parents may use a method to inspire their children to try their best to get a high grade.
3.0	And one of the main methods is offering money when they get a high mak.
3.0	Some people think that this kind of behavior even though can improve children's grade in some degrees, this can also delivery a abnormal thought to the children that the reason why I have to get a excellent grade is because only if so I can get the money.
11.0	I have to admit this circumstance is exist but you can not throw the fault to the specific behavior.
12.0	I agree this kind of method.
4.0	Let us think about how a eligible parent educates his child.
8.0	The most important task of education is to help his child develop its viewponts toward the value and the morality.
8.0	Only when a child has good morality and can judge the values of different things can he do the right things and become successful by his own.
8.0	We have to believe that such a child is able to know his pursuation and reason of learning.
8.0	Under this circumstances, The method that can inspire children's study passion just become a supplement and it will never influenece the children's thought of the reason of study.
8.0	They can gain a great grade and gain the money.
8.0	So why not do this?
4.0	Moreover, I think it is neccessary to let a child have basic ability of the arrangement and management of money.
8.0	In China, because of the high pressure of College Entrance Examination, many students occupied them in the endless studying.
8.0	It seems that there are nothing in their life without learning.
8.0	And the result is they are lack of various ability.
8.0	They do not know the knowlegde of art or history and seldom do body exercise.
8.0	When they get their living money, they do not know how to use it.
8.0	It is ridiculous but this condition truly exist.
4.0	To talk about my own experience, in my childhood, when I got a full score, my mom would give me 20 yuan to but some snacks or toys I like.
9.0	"I enjoyed them so much so I talked to myself: "" You can get another full score and buy more things you want."""
9.0	Yes, I was totally benefited from this method.
1.0	All in all, this method can not only improve children's grade but also has few disadvantages.
1.0	So why not use it if the effection is actually splendid?
12.0	Nowadays, many parents think they should give their school-age children money gor each high grade they get in school.
12.0	Some others may think it's not fit to give school-age children monry for their grde but I think there are many benefits for parents to give them money for their high grade.
4.0	first,giving childrn money as a praise can provide power that to get good grade.
8.0	School-age children always  needs impetus to improve their grade.
8.0	My brothe is a good example.
8.0	When he is in middle school, his grade are usually not high.
8.0	He says he just don't want to work hard to study.
8.0	Then my parents find a way is that telling him if he can get a good grade in the test, they will  give him some money as reward.
8.0	Of course my brother wants to get money,so he works much harder to try to get the high score.
8.0	Finally, his grade gets great improvement.
8.0	I thinl is a really good idea to give the students some power to get the better grade.
4.0	Secomd, by giving them money as reward can teach them how to fight to get what they want.
9.0	Kids sometimes think parents must give them money, they think is a normal thing yo get money from their parents but actually it's not right.
9.0	Through this way, children will understand everything they want should get by hard working,And this feature mau can also help them in the future.
4.0	last, this way may also have some drawbacks.
8.0	For example, the kids may take the money as the most important part in their life.
8.0	It's not really good for the young kids.
8.0	They may create the idea that they only want to fight for the money during their whole life.
2.0	All in all, I think giving school-age children money for each high grade truly has many benefits and it really can help the kids to improve them a lot.
12.0	I disagree this statement which some parents offer their school-age children monry for each high grade they get in school.
8.0	Nowadays, most of parent want let their children to win since they were borned, so they supply too much money for their children to get some extra lesson or hobbies.
8.0	Bacasue they think their children will have harder competition in the future.
8.0	I have three point that support my attitude.
8.0	Firstly, I think children should have their own childhood rather than a schedule of children by their parent.
8.0	I saw too much example that parent run out of their children's free time for studying some thing that their children may not like to do.
8.0	These children always can not get real happy atttude from theire learning, and they usually have conflct with parents, beacuse they do not want to something which they dislike to do.
8.0	But parent always let them have to do these thing.
8.0	This is also some reason why there are many bad attitude students now that I think.
8.0	If they do not get happy, then they will not follow parent's direction.
8.0	Secondly, high grade is depended on forever hard working, it may destroy a child.
8.0	When you have a high grade in the school, you will get many pressure that make you keep you grade or get higher grade, then you will not get any rest because of this reason, or you will get punish when you get lower grade.
8.0	For example, I was second high grade in my first year in my primary school, the my parents and teachers give my lots of expect that I called them pressure, beacuse I fall down to 10th place when the result of my final grade of grade 2.
8.0	My mon and teacher give me less smile because of my grade, they feel disppoint to me, then I also lose my confident for study, after remian of 4 years in my primary school, I can not get the second place of my grade again, and I feel failing.
8.0	Thirdly, money has better way for children's healthy and their happiness rather than only on their grade.
8.0	For example, my friend called Tom, he has very effective studying ability, but he always get sick or other problem of his healthy, that is because his parents only mind his score rather than his healthy.
8.0	And his parent think his unhealthy is beacuse of himself, so I think his grade is not valuable for his healthy, he may not have a long and happiness life in his future, he will consider his health everyday.
8.0	He may not finish his hope in his life.
8.0	I think this life do not have strong reason for exist.
12.0	Recently, there has been ceaseless discussion over whether the opinion of celebrities is more important.
12.0	Some argues that the opinion of celebrities is more important to younger people than old people because the opinion of celebrities lead to fashion, positive attitude or new idea; yet, others propose that the opinion of celebrities is more improtant for old people than younger people.
12.0	personally speaker, I am in a favor of the second arguement.
6.0	Firstly, the younger is so busy every weekday and they can not extro time to pay attention the opinion of celebrities.
8.0	with the developme of the technology and the society competition is becoming more and more serious, many opinion of celebrities were quickly repalced and renew.
8.0	it is easy for people toget confused,Gradually, people are starting to stop focusing on celebrities.
8.0	however, the old people began to pay attention to the view of these famous.
8.0	because they had neither a job nor a need to take care of their grandchildren, they live is so boring and the opinion as
3.0	As far as I am concerned,this is not a good idea in most circumstances.
3.0	For the school-aged children,what they need is very simple.
3.0	Just plained clothes,books which are helpful for their mental health,celebrated dinners and so on.
3.0	And none of them costs high amount of money.
3.0	If parents offer their kids money for high grade mark,the kids may spend the money on many luxury things they don't need at all.
3.0	At the same time,they won't know haw hard their parents earn the money they waste.
12.0	They may turn more and more wasty.
9.0	After they grow up,when their parents can't afford the their needs,they are impossible to get used to it.
9.0	Then something bad may happen and their parents will feel regretful for what they have done all those years.
6.0	There are several examples of this.
8.0	A girl whose parents are just ordinary workers had been spoiled by her parents all the time.
8.0	Her parents gave nearly all the money they earned a month to the girl.
8.0	She then hanged out with her friends and bought everything she wanted without having a glance of the price.
8.0	She took her friends out to dinner in really expensive restaurants so that her friends would like her and more teenagers would love to make friends with her.
8.0	She soon became famous in her school and she enjoyed it,but she didn't know her parents were having a difficult time in their life because of her waste of money.
8.0	After she growed up,she still liked all those luxries.
8.0	But her parents had no more money for her.
8.0	She couldn't believe it and had an big argument with her parents.
8.0	She could not understand them,and that really upset her parents.
8.0	After that,she borrowed more and more money to satisfy her desire and then had no ability to pay back.
8.0	She decided to have a suicide.
8.0	Luckily,she was rescued by her friends.
1.0	From what has been mentioned above,it's not a good idea for parents to offer their kids money for high grade mark.
1.0	The school-age children need to be taught about the right way to spend and manage money.
3.0	The world we are living in has seen drasic changes during the past decades, thanks to the development of science and technology.
3.0	In the context of technological development, amounts of ways to relax appears in our life, like watching a movie or reading some appealing books.
3.0	We no longer relax just by doing physical exercise in the past time.
12.0	So a perturbing problem has arisen whether it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.
5.0	some people really enjoy watching movie or reading the books so they put  their time and energy in the movie and books.
8.0	Through absorbing in the movie and the book, we can get a quick galance on other styles of life in the movie or the book and consider other people's difficulties which make them forget their true life in the outside world and relax themselves.
8.0	At the meanwhile, some people with converse opinion think that by doing physical exercise they can have great leisure time to relax.
8.0	In my opinion, I would favor doing physical exercise.
5.0	As far as I am concerned, watching a movie or reading a book is just like passive entertainment.
8.0	We cannot truely participate in these relaxing activities.
8.0	We feel like relaxing through forgeting our life or our difficulties while watching a movie or reading a book.
8.0	Maybe when finishing watching the movie or reading the book, we must get into our true life immediately and feel nervous again.
8.0	But doing physical exercise is totally different.
8.0	When we take part in the physical exercise, we can totally be absorbed in it and have time think our life in a different angle.
8.0	After long-term physical exercise, we have better body and much energy striking back our difficulties so we can get truly relaxing life.
7.0	So when you feel tired, go to do some physical
3.0	The movies and the televisions are everywhere around us.
3.0	But do them really benefit us?
11.0	I doubt that the good things rhey bring are more than the bad things.
12.0	The public eyesight's decreasing and the less physical activity we take has soem relation with the existence of movies and televisions.
11.0	Also, they make us less capable to appreciate the beauty of natural and less responsible to take our own responsbility.
5.0	First, since the movies and the televisions become common in our dailiy life.
8.0	Young people spend most of their time on watching them.
8.0	Undoubtedly, the eletronic products are harming the young people's eyes.
8.0	I have read a report which shows that since the movies and televisions existed, the ratio of the teenager who has healthy eyesight is deceasing all the time and almost ninety percent of teenagers are wearing glass to things clearly.
8.0	What a pity.
8.0	"There is an old saying, which goes like that ""eyes are the window that we interact with the world.“"
8.0	If that window is closed by the movies and televisions, isn't that a shame.
5.0	Secondly, these two things are makeing us less capable to appreciate beauty of the nature.
8.0	Because wespend most time on watching movies and televisions, all the beautiful things is shown on the screen for a second and tuen to another one immediately.
8.0	There is no chance for us to understand and truly the attractive elements of these natural pictures.
8.0	Take my brother for an instance, when the art teacher announced the grades of the class, he found that his work got the highest marks and the teachers thought the work of him was resembling the naturae most.
8.0	And why did the pictures of other students not resemble the nature?
8.0	Because what they did in holiday is to watch movies, but my brother would be taken outside by my family and he had opportunity to look the really beautiful things.
8.0	Thus, the movies and the televisions is making us have less ideas about beauty.
0.0	Last, many people may say that the movie and television offer us great entertainment.
0.0	But on the other sides, we are becoming less responsible.
0.0	In the past, we have no movie to watch, so we would spend some time finifhing some house work to make our parents less tired.
0.0	But now, all the young people consider is the television programm.
0.0	They even think the housework are supposed to do by our parents, which make them less responsible.
7.0	In this condition, the movies and the televisions are harming us and bring some
3.0	When i watched a TV show, i was confused because workers always do the same jobs everyday.
3.0	In my view, this kind of life like workers go through one day again and again.
3.0	As i grow up, i accidentally see a quesionare which is researching wether workers are more willing to have different kinds of jobs than have the same jobs everyday.
12.0	From my prespective, i prefer the first choice.
5.0	To begin with, different types of jobs make employees more efficient.
8.0	If they have various tasks every single day, they will hold imagination about what kinds of jobs they would do tomorron.
8.0	Moreover, they have more motivation to get things down because they had been expected their works since last night.
8.0	As a result, they can work efficiently, which is good for the company to become more outstanding.
5.0	Second of all, diversity of jobs can decide wether employees can gain enough knowledges.
8.0	The workers are assigned to do different jobs all day long, as we all know, it's unavoidable for them to meet different people because they need to exchange ideas with other members.
8.0	Through this, the workers can enrich themselves by learing how to see things from diiferent prespectives or developing critical thinking.
8.0	Plus.
8.0	they may get to know more about others and then improve their interperson relationships.
0.0	It's no denying that doing similar tasks during the workday can make workers become specilists of the area.
0.0	But nowadays, companies have biger demand for people who can approxiamently handle every fields.
0.0	In my view, going to a company where workers have many types of tasks make it easier for adults to find jobs in the future.
3.0	With the ramarkable progress of people's life standard, we have more expectations towards work.
12.0	Some people think the most satisfying work is that you can deal with identical tasks all day long until you have a good command of them, while I prefer to acknowledge that only vasellite work can make us satisfied, as they not only give us motivation and inspiration but also compel us to be a generalist.
5.0	Above all, well-rounded work gives us inspiration and motivation, since it is unpredictable and makes us feel brand new every day, which can effectively get us out of institutionalization.
9.0	When we are exposed to various kinds of work, we can get along with novel things as much frequently as possible and update our skills and knowledge instantly.
9.0	Our curiosity is well meeted everyday so that we are much more easily to be satisfied with our work and more difficult to get tired of our job.
5.0	On top of that, we are possible to be a generalist by dealing with all types of work.
8.0	As we all know, the generalist is proven to be needed by our society now.
8.0	After being overwhelmed in these various tasks, we will be much more competitive and confident than before, which will contribute a lot to our satisfaction!
8.0	After all, we all want to be popular among emplo Admittedly, Single-type works can mold our character of patient and diligent.
8.0	They can compel us to repeat the same process of a work and learn this work much more thoroughly than others.
8.0	Nevertheless, we are easily to get tired of this sort of work, since this work contradicts with our original mind of seeking for novelty and challenge.
8.0	Thus it is absurd to think the single-type work will make workers satisfied.
2.0	In conclusion, the multi-type work is much more easily to make workers feel satisfied, for it can meet our curiosity and cultivate us to be a popular generalist.
3.0	Nowadays since the modern people pay more attention to the celebrities, these famous people seems to have greater influences on people.
3.0	Some people may think that the opinion came up by celebrities is more important to the younger people while othes hold the view that the celecrities' opinion is more important to the older people.
11.0	From my perspective, I think the younger people is the better receiver of these opinion.
5.0	First of all, the young are easier to be effected by those famous people than the old.
8.0	The younger are more likely to accept the new idea, especially from the famous people they perferred.
8.0	Take myself for example, I am a fan of a famous singer Jay Chou, and I know that Jay is not only a popular star but also a person who is passionate about public welfare activities.
8.0	I remmber that after a big earthquake hit China, Jay donated a large amount of money earned by the concerts to the disaster area and appeal people to donate more money.
8.0	Influenced by him, I donate my pocket money to that area and hope to be a warm-hearted peerson.
8.0	The celebirties possitive opinion could make me be a better person.
5.0	Secondly, young people are more sensitive when they obtain the opinion from the celebrities, which means they have the ability to recognize whether the opinion is useful for them.
8.0	The opinion came up by the famous are always too innovative for olders to accept.
8.0	For example when a kind of smartphones showed up, and the company hired a well-known singer to advertise the product.
8.0	The olders may be impacted to buy the phone but actually the smartphones have no use to them.
8.0	However, for the young person, they will think carefully after they saw these information, and the opinion came up by the modern celebrities seems more useful to the young people.
2.0	In conclusion, considering the fact that the older's minds are not open enough to accept the opinion from the famous people, the celebrities' opinion is more significant for the younger people because these opinion can let the young people make a change.
11.0	Since there is a growing requirement in people's work, they need to accomplish more work within the same time, which leads to a controversy that people are supposed to work quickly or not.
11.0	In my opinion, it is more important for people to work quickly and rish making mistakes rather than work slowly and my reasons and examples are given below.
5.0	First, why woking quickly can be a better choice is that it can help people work more effective.
8.0	If people work faster, they can fishish their duty within less time, which gives them more time to relax and recover from working.
8.0	As a result, they can have a more energy for their next work.
8.0	For instance, my brother is an editor and always have a lot of work to do.
8.0	However, he managed to make himself work swiftly.
8.0	So he always has twenty minutes to relax after finishing a single job.
8.0	Hence, he is always vigorous and effective when it comes to the upcoming work.
5.0	Second, although working quickly cannot avoid making mistakes, people can learn from it and reduce the possibility of making faults.
8.0	A good case in point is that no matter how many assignment I have, I am never afraid of making mitakes.
8.0	When I was doing a cashier as a part-time job, I must handle a lot of money and arrange it.
8.0	Initially, I often make mistakes for I was doing fast.
8.0	However, with more work being handled, I got the way to decrese the possibility of making mistakes.
8.0	As  a result, I became moer effective and made less mistakes.
7.0	Finally, If people works slowly, they may easily become afraid of making mistakes, which will make them
3.0	Have you ever seen that some people learned many different fields, but they don't understand well in each fields?
11.0	Some people in the society think that people's measureless potentials can make them do many different things well in the same timie.
11.0	When it comes to the opinion that people will do bad in each of the things when they focus on many different areas, I strongly agree.
11.0	There are three aspects that can help me to illustrate my perspective.
6.0	First of all, when people have to do many different things, they will change their concentations more frequently.
8.0	It will make all the thing cannot be finished perfectly because people are not delicated.
8.0	For instance, nowadays, many parents decided to make their children learning many different areas, like art, music, dance and so on.
8.0	However, children cannot pay attention to so many different subjects.
8.0	It will make them easy to forget the skills and knowlege about each fields when they are busy on another thing.
8.0	Instead, some children just study one or two subjects and understand them very well.
8.0	They may not forget them during a large period of time.
10.0	Second,
3.0	Advertisements in the Television is a common phenonmenon, especially in the modern society.
3.0	In order to make more profits, the mechants concentrate on  the strategy that the advertisement should be targeted at a specific group of people , including the kids aging from two tho five.
11.0	In my opinion, I hold the possitive view that the advertisement could be classified by the needs of varies kinds of people.
5.0	Firstly, kids also have the needs for materials.
8.0	As we all know, kid have the nature to play.
8.0	For instance, toy cars, dolls, books or even just a pen is indispensible in the process for their growing.
8.0	And the appropriate advertisement   can just meet the needs for kids' material demand.
5.0	Moreover,  the real individuals that watchTelevision advertising are kids'parents instead of themselves.
8.0	So there are so such thing like kids are easier to be disoriated or cheated by the ads.
8.0	Adult have the distinctive sense to tell what are suitable for kids future developement and what are junks preventing kids to growing up normally.
8.0	Take my nephew as an example,  he  is a five-year-old kid, his mom always buy a seris of cartoon books.
8.0	At the time i come by and visit him, i figure out that he is throwing himself out reading the book and even talking to the cartoon figure in the picture.
8.0	I asks his mom how does she know the book is perfect for the kids.
8.0	She says she have watched the ads on TV and the peers also read the same kind of books.
8.0	Since then, i know the  positive power of media to spread a wonderful atomosphere to read.
2.0	In conclusion, there is every reason to believe that television advertising aimed at young children could both meets the need for them and  have a positive affect since slec
3.0	In my opionon,I think it is better to do physical exercise comparing to watch a movie or read a book .
12.0	Here is my explaination.
11.0	First of all,doing exercise makes us healthier and more energetic which  may do good to our lives.
8.0	however,when you spend a lot of time trying to kill time with a movie or a book,your body might be relexed too much to be fit.
8.0	For sake of keeping healthy,we must continue exercising no matter how busy or how lazy you are.
8.0	You know,it is health that make our lives colorful and meaningful.
8.0	One of my relatives who loves staied at home and relax all day died of lacking exercise.
8.0	If she had paid more attention to  taking care of her body,she would have had a better life.
8.0	So,doing exercise is not only a way to relax ourselves,but also a way to make us fit enough to conquer the problems  in our daily lives.
6.0	Second,doing exercise will let us throw away bad temper and other terrible emotion.
8.0	A recent research said that doing exercise can help you decrease pressure and make your mind clean and clear.
8.0	Obviously,the more you taking exercise,the less pressure you will have.
8.0	Some white collars also choose doing exercise as a efficent way to decrease pressure.
8.0	If you are stressed out,it is a great and fast way to make yourself feel better.
0.0	Also,there are quantities of advantiges of doing exercise.
0.0	Now I will tell you the bad effect of just lying on the sofa to watch a movie or a book.
0.0	In fact,many people will choose this way just beacause it is quite easy to finish.
0.0	however,it may make your mind lazy.
0.0	In order to have a energetic a rigid ,I think that doing physical exercise is much meaningful than just wasting your time on the sofa.
3.0	Nowadays, there comes a trend that students are more and more often awarded for there great academic performence by their parents.
11.0	And no doubt the most common rewarding is to give them money.
4.0	From where I stand, I firmly believe that efficient as it is to lift children's interest in studying, it is, to some extent, leading children to a wrong direction in that they are just pushed by temptation of getting more money, but overlook the original meaning of getting knowledge.
8.0	And giving children money for their high grade may just encloud them with a potential idea that they learn just for money, a wealthy futurn life.
8.0	Actually many children had a great ambition for their own, some wanted to be scientists, some determined to be engineers, some turned their head to save lives, however, surrounding by such a money-drived atmosphere and system, many of them has lost their initial mind.
8.0	So,since this cannot cut the mustard, parents should reflect  themselves.
4.0	There is no denying that rewarding is essential during children's studying, maybe offering chilredn a Kindle, or just encouraging them mentally may works better.
10.0	parents are to children what soil is to flowers, rich soil will absolutely help flowers for their growth, however, acid soil, although let flowers root themselves deeply, would kill them at final.
4.0	Since money is the acid soil, we must throw them away and replace them with a more nutricious things such an a family-trip, a happy party, a sweet kiss, or just a common encouragement.
9.0	All of these will  contribute to children's correct attitude towards learning and fuel their way to a higer level.
9.0	Another way is to cultivate children's interest in study and aware them that they must keep going, or they will not achieve any advancement.
10.0	These ov
8.0	To think about this topic, I think we should considering this queation first: where is the origion of your tiredness?
8.0	It comes from your body or your soul?
8.0	We both have the experience that if we stick on one single work of English or Marhs for a long time will greatly effect our work efficency.
8.0	This is the type of tiredness of spirit and if we can find some other work to do, just like watching a moive or reading a book, we will feel much better cause our brain can transfer the activate region!
8.0	But not all tiredness comes from this way, it may occur when your life is facing a big problem or a tough challenge.
8.0	No matter how frequently you changing your current work, this type of tiredness will follow you as a ghost.
8.0	I call it the tired of body doesn't mean it is somekind of physical illness, I mean it is just a part of yourself.
8.0	We can see a lot of people yelling all day long wish to change their life but all of them fail sooner or later.
8.0	What's the reason?
8.0	From my point of view, they can't see the truth of their problem is themselves.
8.0	If you can't change part yourself from bottom of your heart, you can't change your life anyway.
8.0	By taking this into consideration, we can tell the linkage between physical exercise and solving the problems of the tiredness of body.
8.0	Everytime I complete my exercise mission I can feel a refreshment of myself: I can forget the unpleasent things, I can make a new plan of my study project, I have energy to do all the work it takes to make me a better man.
8.0	This is just the begin of self-improving and as long as it start to roll, you can see the tiredness of body get away day by day till your whole life totally changed.
8.0	So, all I can tell is that there is no better choice of relaxation, the most suitable one is the best.
8.0	Find the origion of your tiredness then choose the suitable way to solve it, then you will receive true relaxation: the peace of your heart.
3.0	In this generation, parents usually pay high attention on their child.
3.0	In China, a family usually has only one child, they are likely to be the great lawyer or pripority of this sosiety in thier parents' thoughts, so that parents get high hope on children.
11.0	Some would think nowadays parents are much more open-minded and they will respect childrens' own choice and opinions, but I believe that parents most of them still force the young generation to do things they don't like.
5.0	First of all, with a low self-conciousness and changable thoughts, they need parents to make the decision.
8.0	My friend is a person who almost enjoy everything around her, she wants to try everything.
8.0	However, she doesn't know how to choose a good friend which can help her a lot ,or how to protect herself from emergency and the environment.
8.0	Today she promises to be a painter when she grow up, but tomorrow she will immediately change her mind.
8.0	But her parents know her the best, and she doesn't have the right to say anything.
5.0	Secondly, high technology devices and the outside world blind teen's eyes from exploring them.
8.0	The materials' world is colorful, and individuals just do the things they like.
8.0	I used to want to be a photographer when I grow up, because of its enjoyable working experience.
8.0	But only after knowing that the professional prothographer have to carry tons of heavy things and they may work at night without having payment, I give up my mind right away.
8.0	The answer to this career is ridiculous,I can not fully understand whether the job is good or not by one person's words , only because I am aroused by the surroundings.
8.0	I am not familiar with the world, for the sake of I am a teenager.
8.0	By my parents help me to make a decision.
8.0	They say doctor is a good job, as it can have a large amount of the salary, and it will make my life meaningful.
0.0	Last but not the least, in the past, young people didn't have such strengh to face so many things.
0.0	In my mom's childhood, she only have to worry about what to eat and what to wear.
0.0	They didn't  get high hope from their parents so that parents didn't expect much.
0.0	After school they can go anywhere they want and the only decision they have to follow by the parents was to go back home before 10.
3.0	Now,with development of education,pople have different idea about children on making mistakes.
12.0	For me,I think kids should learn from their mistakes.
8.0	Children is a weak group.
8.0	They are not able to choose which one is right.
8.0	S they need parents to help.
8.0	what is more,if they just are told that you are not right and they would have not thought it wrong.
8.0	And they may do it again.
8.0	On the contary,they can realize the mistake and learn from it ,they have a good expressionabout it ,when they meet the same thing ,they would recall and never do it again.
6.0	As I remember,my father and I went for a walk,when I was young.
8.0	I ask my father to buy something to eat .
8.0	Something is wrong happened.
8.0	I drop the rubbish on the road.
7.0	while my father
3.0	nowadays, many student did not interested in their study, so that will make their parent very nervous thus many parentsoffer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school .
3.0	however ,as a student I think it is a really good iaea .
11.0	an i have some reason to support my oppnion.
5.0	first of all ,when the students in their school they  have many pressure from both their parents and thier classmate.
8.0	they need to foucs on their work any times even their free times ,because they want to get a good university offer also they did not want to let their parents down,however ,many student can not bear all the pressure  ,maybe their will give up .
8.0	so i think the money is the one way to realise the students pressure .
8.0	they can do any things they want if they have free money.
5.0	the other reason is that ,it can let the student have more power.
8.0	some of student did not konw why need to study ,when they graduate from high school they still need to study in university .
8.0	they have this ideas just because they are too simple so parents need to use some simple things to encourege their children .
8.0	such as money .
8.0	when those students have some power to study ,it become more easy to study.
2.0	so, from both of my reasons i am extraodinary believe that parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school is a good idea.
8.0	I agree with the statement that parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn fromm their own mistakes.
8.0	First of all, when children make mistakes, they can think about if the action he take is wrong then try to right them with effort so that he won't make the same mistakes again.
8.0	Like the math problem you meet.
8.0	You give the wrong response once, and you will give the correct ones when you meet the same problem another time.
8.0	Corret mistakes is a procession of uncovering one's shortage as well as the bad habbits and fixing the problem you are facing now.
8.0	Each time you make a mistake, you betteren yourself once.
6.0	Secondly, as an old saying, even the greatest man in the world can't avoid making mistakes.
10.0	Everyone has the experience of making mistakes, so parents should give them the opportunity to right the mistakes.
12.0	In my opinion, in 20 years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.
12.0	there are several reason why I think the cars will be fewer, the new transportation mothods, more convenient public transportation and the higher car cost.
4.0	Firstly, there wii be some new transportation in 20 years.
8.0	As we know, with the development of the technology, more and more inventions have been created.
8.0	now days,so many cars  cause a lot of polution wich is harmful to our environment and themumerous cars beyond the capacity of city transportaion system.
8.0	Therefore,  those face will boost people  come up with a new transportation mothods to replace the car.
8.0	For example, some inventor will cread a kind of plane which use theelectronic power fly through the city.
8.0	this kind of new transpotation is good for the environment and make the transport more smoothly, so they will replace the car very soon.
4.0	Second, government maybe will build more conveient public transportation to the citizen. a amout of cars will make road and strees very busy which will cause citizen take a lot of time on shift from one places to another place.
8.0	it will reduce the efficiency.
8.0	Public transprotation can solve this problem.
8.0	For example ,in the subway, no matter how many peope there, subway can arrive to one station from other station on time, it would ont effect by other issues.
4.0	Finally, the fuel cost is higher and higher and the fix fee for the car is more and more expensive.
8.0	Many people can not afford the cost for car that cause  it is not necessary to own a car.
8.0	the higher cost to own a car push peopleto choose other mohods for transprotation.
8.0	For example, the car cost become higher, many citizen dicide to ride a bicycle  to go to work,rater
1.0	In conclusion, in 20 years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.
1.0	there are several reason why I think the cars will be fewer, the new transportation mothods, more convenient public transportation and the higher fuel cost.
12.0	whether school-age children can get mony as prize when they do well at school has become a heated debate between peolpe.
12.0	Generally speaking, I think offering them money as reward.
11.0	it is a wise choice.
12.0	Here are my reasons.
4.0	First, money can be a good motivation for children.
8.0	Since they can gain reward when they get high grade, they will try their best in studying in order to earn poket money.
8.0	Namely, when they want to own something new, they will no begging parents with tears and screaming, but to put efforts on their school work.
8.0	This not only give them opportunity to buy what they want, but also raise their academic interest.
4.0	Second, different from directly giving them gifts parents have chosen already to make them disappointed, money can bring them more selections.
8.0	Parents don't  understand what their children really want.
8.0	When I was a little girl, my parents offered me a book which only contains black and white pictures.
8.0	They thought I will pretty enjoy coloring those well-complete pictures with my crayons, but actually, I didn't like it at all.
8.0	I was a creative child, that's why I prefer drawing pictures by myself from initial white sheet instead of coloring other people's work.
8.0	If they gave me the money directly, I will rather buy a blank sketch book!
4.0	Second, this can help children build right recognition on money.
8.0	From paying huge effort on studying to earn money, they will know how their parents working hard to feed the family.
8.0	When they feel this feeling as well, they will not waste or use the money so fast than they earn.
8.0	So offering money is an educational strategy for children.
2.0	According to all I have disscussed above, It is not hard to understand that I agree that offering money to school-age children for their high mark is a good idea.
3.0	Recently, there is a heated discussion about the important decisions.
11.0	Some people believe that young people today have no influence on the essential decisions that determine the future of society as a whole, because they just determine which job they want to do.
11.0	It has nothing to do with the future of society.
11.0	However, others hold a dissimilar viewpoint that young people have effect on the important decisions about the future of society.
11.0	As for me, I agree with the latter one.
12.0	My reasons and examples are listed as follows.
5.0	One reason why I am in favor of my perspective is that old people's thoughts have been out of date.
8.0	This is because old people's ideas are used until now, but the society needs to progress.
8.0	The society needs some new ideas to help it to improve.
8.0	A good example of this is a case of my mother's friend.
8.0	Once one of my mother's friends wanted to have her own company to research high technology, but she had not studied this knowledge.
8.0	She could not do this, but young poeple had studied when they were in school.
8.0	They could do it.
5.0	Another relevant reason used to support my opinion is that the ideas of young people are more novel and inventive.
8.0	This is because young people live in a technologically advanced society, they can know more knowledge than old people.
8.0	A good example of this some undergraduates' case.
8.0	Now, many students in colleges sponsor some activities that can change the society.
8.0	These ideas are created by young people.
8.0	Old people just take part in these activities and do something they need to.
2.0	According to these reasons given before, I think that young people today have more influence on the significant decisions that determine the future of society as a whole.
3.0	The wilderness and wild animals has forever been a part of the human culture, life and soul.
11.0	Although some may argue that more land should be developed for economic purposes, I still stand that the wilderness should be protected for the future generation, and also our own.
4.0	One should never cut down one's roots.
8.0	The wild is the root of humans.
8.0	It is where we all come from.
8.0	However we might evolve, might grow, we can never change the fact that we come from the wild, and to the wild we shall all go.
8.0	Just as history is protected by a nation, the wild should be protected by the human kind.
8.0	For the wild is our history that  lives on.
8.0	The generation of children now see little enough of the wild, what will happen to it if it continues to fade.
8.0	Will they forget where they come from?
8.0	How unsettling that will be.
8.0	It may lead to ignorance, and the continuous distruction of the environment until Earth is no longer enhabitable.
8.0	There is a book called Brave New World, where people have lived in a community completely artificial.
8.0	All who have read the book could see how horrid that is.
8.0	It is not the future anyone would wish for the generation of tomorrow.
8.0	Remebering our roots can let us make better choices for our future.
4.0	The wild is where the human body and soul can truly become one.
8.0	Many spiritual trips taken in the wilderness.
8.0	Like going to Tibetan plateau to live with the monks.
8.0	In a simple and natural temple, staring out at the mountains, listening to the soud of raindrops from the windowledge, and humming the ancient rhymes.
8.0	Without the sophistication of human society, can one really settle down one's heart, and all that is outside, and focus on what is going inside.
8.0	My trip to a remote little town in the mountains taught me that.
8.0	Time passes on by, but one does nothing but stare out into the wilde, mysterious sky.
8.0	People need that in this fast, and often brainwrecking society.
8.0	Governments should protect the wild, if only to keep their citizens sain.
8.0	The future generations deserve to have this sort of comfort.
4.0	Although it is necessary for the society to expand, and have more resources, but it does not have to come at the price of the wild.
10.0	As the resources in the human hands are plenty, I don't seem to see the problem with people trying to expand the resources at hand to the fullest, instead of mindlessly exploting the untouched, sacred, and ever wild land.
1.0	May the wild help them make better choices, and be more spiritually connected, and relaxed.
1.0	For the better of the future generation, I sincerely hope the government will put in more effort to protect the wild areas and wild animals.
3.0	With the remarked progress of the society,people  have more and more perssure,so it become important for people to learn how to relax.
12.0	Some people believed that watching a movies or reading a book is a good way to relax.
11.0	Others think that doing physical exercise will be more useful.
11.0	Persomally,i believe that it is better to relax by doing physical exercise.
11.0	There are some reasons that illustrate my point of view.
4.0	One reason is that practices can keep healthy while relaxing ourselives.
8.0	Nowadays,people devote themselives into working and ignore their bodies.
8.0	Therfore,many youghs are in sub-healthy.
8.0	So,it is wonderful for them to running or swimming to have a rest.
8.0	It not only help them keep healthy,but also have a break at the same time.
4.0	secondly,doing exercise can help head work better.
9.0	For instance, one day i have a heavy workload ,when i finish the job ,i must be very tired.
9.0	So, at that time ,i can go out to take a walk and breath fresh air,which give me enough energy for next work.
4.0	Admittedly,watching films or reading books also can relax us.
9.0	However,they also need to use our eyes which need rest after a complix work.
9.0	So, the best way to relax is doing practices which can keep our health and refersh our head.
1.0	From what has been discussed above, we can safely draw a conclusion that exercise is better for us to relax when we take a break.
1.0	Thus, when you finish your whole day work,let's go out to runing or swimming.
3.0	Nowadays more and more parents offer extrem love to their children.
3.0	And some parents offer their school-age children money for high grade.
11.0	From my perspective, it's not a good idea.
11.0	My reasons and examples are as following.
5.0	First, there are many ways for parents to praise their children when they get high grade in school.
8.0	It's not a good way that offering school-age children money.
8.0	School-age children are too young to have the ability to spend those money well.
8.0	If they spend those money incorrectly, like spending money on games, it's not good for them study well.
8.0	Parents can offer their children something else, such as watching movies, buying them gifts, encouraging.
5.0	Also, it's not a good idea that offer money for each high grade.
8.0	Parents can offer gifts depending on children's progress in their study.
8.0	Besides, high grade is not a standard criterion for awards.
8.0	If children have done something that they never did, parents can encourage them.
0.0	Admittedly, it's a idea for parents to offer money for high grade their children get in school, but it's not a good idea.
0.0	In a nutshell, there are other methods for parents to offer their children and high grade is not equal to awards.
0.0	So my opinion is offering school-age children money for high grade is not a good idea.
3.0	"As the saying goes ""Failure is the mother of success."""
3.0	Nowadays,some parents agree the view that children are allowed to make mistakes, but the others disagree with it .
3.0	Nonetheless.
3.0	In my point a view.
3.0	I support the former .
12.0	Here are my reasons.
4.0	In the first place, Making mistakes will help strendthen children's ability of solving problems as they will learn the method from the mistakes.
8.0	For example, many students may get bad grades after finishing examinations which are so difficult.
8.0	Through the failure, most of them will study harder and deepen their realization of mistakes.
8.0	In spite of the progree is not favoring.
8.0	However,the learning progress, they make great effort, will give them unforgetable impresson.
8.0	On in this way can they know the efficient method to solve problem.
4.0	Moreover,It is the way that develop children's capacity of individual thinking.
8.0	they need to consider further and more thorough about their mistakes by themselves.
8.0	If parents had not let them make mistakes,they could not form their habit of thinking independely and they might depend on their parents forever.
8.0	It is a bad influence on children's growth.
4.0	Last but not least, It can boost the relationship between children and parents.
8.0	Once children made mistakes,the parents , obviously, give a helping hand to their kids.
8.0	Because the parents are the people who know their children most.
8.0	During the communication, their relationship are able to develp increasely.
0.0	In a word, parents'd better let their children have mistakes.
0.0	"Kongzi, in our country,is a philosopher and educator who has the elevated reputation；he has a famous quote that""A fault confessed can be cured'."
0.0	For children's future, we need them to have mistakes.
0.0	If the children be stronger, our whole nation will be more confident!
3.0	With the development of modern technology, people have varied ways to communicate with others such as email, social media application or message.
11.0	So a controversial topic arouses a debate: whether people should use email or communicate in person when they want to do a project.
11.0	Some people believe that it is more casual to do project through email.
11.0	However, I hold the view that people should communicate personnal when they do a project.
11.0	My view can be illustrated as follows.
5.0	First, communicating personal will help people get the real imformation and filter bias.
8.0	People can know about the opinion not only through the words but also the body language which sometimes express one's real thoughts.
8.0	With meeting face to face, people can identify whether the interview is effective or not.
8.0	But if people just collect the question and anwser list through email, the responser may not express their first statements and cheat in anwsering the question.
8.0	For example, I have ever done a project in email and spread about 100 persons.
8.0	The responser all said our products are good even some people did not use our products which we could clarify if we communicate with them face to face.
8.0	Eventually the consequense of the project is not satisfying.
5.0	Second, communicating personnal will help to get more imformation in limited time.
8.0	People can know about others opinion with particular and specific question, and the question will be answered immediatedly.
8.0	On the other hand, the email will be easily missed and people can not get feedbak at once.
8.0	For example, my friend Amy want to ask her professor about her paper topic, she write an email the professor.
8.0	After a week she get the feedback so that she thinks it is not effctive.
8.0	Then she goes to the professor's office meet him personnal and professor solves all her proplem in an hour.
2.0	To sum up, when people do a project, they should communicate in person but not through emails.
7.0	Not only because people can get real information but also get information qui
8.0	Currently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people: In the economic crisis which can be reduced, library, police or public transportation.
8.0	Opinion vary from person to person.
8.0	Some claim that police and publice transportation are not necessary to the people.
8.0	However, contrary to their view comes my perspective that in that case, the library may not be a place people really need.
8.0	My point can be elaborated as follows.
6.0	First of all, reducing the amount of money spent on libraries will not have a big impact on people in an economic crisis.
8.0	To be more specific, people spend their time thinking about how to make more money, they don not have as much time to read as before.
8.0	On the contrary, if the government spends money in the library, they will likely going to lose these money, because no one goes to the library at all, so that will exacerbate the economic crisis and slow down the global econnmic crisis.
8.0	For example, our government, hoping to change people's mood during the economic crisis, invested some money in the library.
8.0	As a result, no one reads book in the
3.0	Recently, celebrities' effects are of great significance to our society, since many people are concerned about what the celebrities' attitude toward an event or a product.
3.0	So an increasing number of companies employ celebrities like renowned singers, actors, and athletes, to advertise for their products.
11.0	In my opinion, there are more youger people who will care about the opinions of celebrities than older people.
5.0	First, younger people are more familar about those celebrities than the olders.
8.0	It is more likely for a person to care about the opinion of a celebrity when he or her is femiliar with that celebrity.
8.0	For instance, one day, there was a big event, and one of my favourite actors had expressed his attitude toward it.
8.0	Though I am very concerned about this, when I talked about this event with my grandma, she told me that she even did niot know who he was.
8.0	In that case, it is not hard to believe, older people may not care about the opinions of celebrities, since sometimes they are not familiar with these famous people or even don't know them.
5.0	Second, the olders are more independent and have their own ideas so that they will not care about the opinions of renowned people or pay less attention about them.
8.0	For example, myn grandpa always thinks that the ideas of a celebrity cannot be completely trust.
8.0	Because they have different situations with us.
8.0	Renowned people are weathier than most of us, and they do some things we cannot imagine.
8.0	Therefore, in their opinions, many things can be solved by money and many things can be solved by their assistants, they even don't need to get involved of some things.
7.0	To sum up, I think the opinions of celebrities are more significant to you
3.0	what would you do to relax yourself？
3.0	i am sure that the answers would be varied.
3.0	Some of my friends like playing vidio games when relaxing,and somes enjoy reading books.
11.0	As for me,doing physical exercise is my favorite.
5.0	I once talked about this with my friends.
8.0	Most of them thought it would be better to be calm while relaxing thus watching excels doing exercise.
8.0	It was easy to understand.
8.0	When you are tried,exercising makes you more tired.
5.0	However,I am holding on to another point of view.
8.0	Actually,in most cases,we are only mentally fatigued when we want a relax.
8.0	So doing exercise does not make things worse.
8.0	More over,physical exercising can let me get a thorough mental relaxation and get your mind free when I fouse on  the body.
8.0	On the other hand,regular exercising makes me healthy then I would be less easily to get tired.
10.0	I really can
12.0	When the triffic becoming more and more convenient, people have available ways to travel around the world.
12.0	And there are also have various  typies on their trip, like go to the unfamiliar city alonely and enjoy private vacation or share the time with friends, and also, in my opinion the best way to travel is in a group by a tour guide, with the help of a tour guide, the trip will more comfortable.
6.0	The tour guide is indispensable because he or she can make a suitable schedule accroding to the demend that come up with the tourists.
10.0	For example, when I was guaduated, and wanted to have a trip with my friends, but we are strange with the city that we plan to go.
3.0	The author thinks that watching a movie or reading a book can relax us more than by doing physical exercise.
3.0	There is no doubt that when we are tired or in fatigue,we can relax us by watching a movie or reading a book.
11.0	However,if we are nervous or work a long time,taking physical exercise can be better for us to relax.
5.0	On the one hand,for example,when we have done the physical work for a whole day,we are exhausted and tired.
8.0	What can make us feel better is to relax our mind.
8.0	Under this condition,we can watch a movie or read a book in sofa with a cup of tea or coffee.
8.0	In this way,we will concentrate on the contents of the movie or the book so that the bodies' fatigue will be ignored and we will feel relaxed.
5.0	On the other hand,what if we are nervous when there will be a exam in next day or work in office for a whole day.
8.0	It is quite possible that our minds are out of control,and we cannot stop ourselves to think about the work or study.
8.0	Thus,it is better to relax by doing physical exercise under this condition.
8.0	During taking physical exercise,we can release pressure of taking the exam or stretch our bodies after sitting in the office for a whole day by using out of our energy so that we have no more vigor to think about them.
0.0	To sum up,what we should do first is to know which stage we are in.
0.0	After finding out what make us feel not better exactly,we can choose right way to relax us.
0.0	Specifically speaking,if we are tired mentally,what we should do is to take some physical exercise to relax our bodise.
0.0	Of course,if we are tired physically,we should watch a movie or read a book to relax our mind.
10.0	The Benefits of  Doing Physical Exercise to Relax
11.0	In my point of view ,I think it is better to do physical exercise to relax rather than by watching a movie or reading a book.
12.0	Here are some specific reason to support my view.
5.0	First and foremost,doing physical exercise is not only beneficial to your health ,but it also relax your mind.
10.0	Recently, an investigation made Qinghua University shows that physical exercise can help to relieve one's nerve by release a special kind of chemical which can make our moods better.
5.0	As we all know , doing physical exercise can build a strong body.
8.0	For example , doing work outs can enhance our muscles and make them stouter and stronger,whilewatching a movie and reading abook are bad for our eyes and even can cause short sightness.
8.0	Research shows that if one concentrates  on something within 5 metres for two hours or more, the harm that has made is enternal.
8.0	The happineness they give us is much ,but through a long term aspect,they actually are harmful.
7.0	However, if you do physical exercise to relax , there i
3.0	Nowadays， more and more people pay attition to  young people .
11.0	Most people think because modern life is very complex , so it is more importent thing that young people need to have the ability to plan and organize.
11.0	I agree with that , because In today' s society , more and more company need to new blood --- young people , The company need to young people  manage the company, if young people have ability , then they will have more jobs.
6.0	When young peolple into society , they need to survivus and adept in society , improve their ability of plan and organize is good for  them to find a work.
8.0	I have a friend , she is a university graduare.
8.0	When she in university, she is a proprieter , this let her gian the ability of organize.
8.0	she is good at to conversation with other prople  , that  practice her.
8.0	When she graduare .
8.0	Three more company invest her , and she passed their interviews.
8.0	Becuse those company absent manager, like her.
7.0	The modern life is very complex, there is more and more competition between people , so if you don't get improve , you will lose in the
10.0	Educating chilsren today
3.0	Some claim that educating chilren today is more difficult than it was in the past, for children devote a lot of time on cell phone, online games and social network web site.
3.0	However, I disagree with this point.
11.0	In fact, educating has become easier than before with the advanced technology.
4.0	Web is a great source of knowledge, through surfing the internet, children are able to get in touch with a wide range of knowledge.
8.0	This is an easier source knowledge than books, for all the thing you need to do is clicking a few words to the serch engine,and then you can get the result.
8.0	The internet enhances the spread of knowledge and reduces the cost of getting knowledge.
8.0	And make the educating method developed, For on the past, a children may have to sit in the classroom and easily get bored.
8.0	With modern technology, you can easily keep the interest of children and make the process of education fun.
4.0	Next, today parents and educators could also know better about educating children.
8.0	Take my family as example, when my grandparents had my father, their first kid, they admitted it was a difficult task, for they were lack of experience on how to raise and educate a child.
8.0	In consquence, they had to explore by themselves.
8.0	They told me they did not do well in some perspects.
8.0	And they turly did better when they raised my aunt.
8.0	However, with today's easy access to knowledge, parents and educators could easily know which way is better for children, for they can share experience with others and grab systemtic knowledge of educating children.
8.0	Modern technology turly enhances the quality of educating children.
4.0	I have to admit cell phone and online games turly remove children's passion.
8.0	However, if this thing don't exist, it doesn't mean they will devote the time to the area which is thought useful by parents.
8.0	Children always search for some thing fun, they always tend to enjoy themselves.
8.0	You can ban the equipment from his life, but you can not control them to do all you want.
4.0	Every coin has two sides, modern technology turly cost children a lot of time, but it also offers new method of educating children.
10.0	The key point is not banning the technology, but make it a useful tool of us.
11.0	Nowaydays, parents are more willing to send children to a school which focuses more on a well-planned routine.
12.0	This routine refers to joing organized activities related to school or sports, and adjusting more time for students to do their homework.
11.0	Kids have less time to do what they truly desire.
9.0	From my perspective, this is a wrong decision because i think  a child should be allowedto do what he or she wants.
9.0	The reasons are as follows.
4.0	Firstly, regulating children to do these precisely organized things or spend more time doing homework may lead to the dislike of school and even rebellion.
8.0	If children are asked make more efforts with their work and required to participate in activities or sports that they totally dislike, they would definitly be unwilling to do so.
8.0	In addition, they lack the knowledge of why they are doing these kind of things, so in their mind, grown-ups never consider their opinion and asks them to do boring things.
8.0	This feeling might even cause disobeyment.
8.0	For example, my brother was asked to do homework all night long and the only sport he could play was football, which was really famous in his school.
8.0	He never liked ball games, but because he never had time to play what he wanted and was always pushed to do homeworks, he always argues with my parents and even thought of quitting school.
4.0	Secondly, allowing children to follow their own choices can lead to creativity and success.
8.0	When immersed in the things we like, we tend to forget the time and concentrate more on that particular aspect.
8.0	Thus with full concetration we are likely to come up with new and fascinating thoughts and ideas, which are innovating and leads to success.
8.0	My cousin loves painting and her parents support her dream so they allow her to draw every  day.
8.0	Indulged in the use of countless colours, she created a pattern of her own,  her paintings were even sent to an exhibition.
4.0	Though the things children are required to do now may be beneficial to their future.
8.0	However children may lack their own unique characteristics and personalities.
8.0	Due to the fact that they were always asked to do homework and attend the planned activities and sports, they might not have their own interest and hobbies, not to speak their preferences.
8.0	They may be the ones who continuously follows the trend, but they may never be the ones who stand out among the crowd.
0.0	All in all, I subscribe to the idea that children should be allowed to follow their heart.
0.0	By doing so they may enjoy learning and parents don't need to worry about arguements.
0.0	Also by becoming a creative person with great personality, they will sure succeed in the future.
11.0	I don't think it's a good idea.
8.0	Because i think study is a student's own tasks and he or she has the responsibility to study for himself or herself, and if the parents offer thier school- age children money just for the high grade they get, the students may think they are studying just for the money from the parents.
8.0	As a result, they won't work hard in the future when thry have to live on themselves.
8.0	Students have to study just for having more opportunities to success or having better education sources and better environment to achieve what thy want.
8.0	As for me, i study for my own, i konw that the competition in the social it's cruel, and i am an ambitious person, so i'll study very hard just for my future development.
8.0	If i just study for the money from my parents, i won't have motivation to achieve my goal.
6.0	If the parents offer their school-age students money for the high grade, the children will just focus on their acdemic subjects,  they won't develop their other habits to enjoy the life and to experience the difference of the world which is unwise for the children's future development.
8.0	On the other hand, if they have other habits, they can adjust to the social better and find what they really want to do when they are in the social instead of being hopeless for not knowing what to do.
8.0	I have many habits, such as dancing, singing, drawing, swimming,playing the piano and so on, and i think my life is very unique because i have more ways and views to feel the world which others can't.
8.0	Also thanks to my parents, they supported to learn more different things when i was a little girl instead of giving me money for the high grades, so i am more out-going than my peer.
8.0	in addition, i am very proud of myself and my parents, i do well in my acdemic subjects as i have high grades, and also i am in a band as the vocal.
8.0	What's more  i am in the student's union.
8.0	I have a lot of friends because of my richful experience.
2.0	Parents should encourage their children to do well to get high grades, but they should do it in a healtheir way instead of offering money.
11.0	I agree with this proach to give school age students money for each high grade, and these are my following reasons.
4.0	To start with this,Give the children money when they get good grade is a very useful way to encourage the children to work harder in the next time ,the children will think their parents are accord about their hard working, and think if they work harder and they will get more rewards.
9.0	the parents can gives the rewards to their children after they work and the rewards can not be too much or too low.
9.0	i am sure it can courage many children.
4.0	The second reason is that,this proach can teach the children how to control the money.
10.0	The parents can gives their children constant value of the money as their rewards,an tell them how to use the money correctly,it not only can prove the ability of control money,it also can build a basic way for their children,in the future,they will use money correctly and when they are in their career maybe this ability will become an advantage for their future jobs.
4.0	The third reason is that this proach can gives children confidence.
8.0	If you don not give the children any essentially rewards after they got really great grades,the children maybe think you do not trust them and dose not care about their hard work,and you will let them to lose the confident to working hard and dissapoint with your atitude with their work.
8.0	In that way giving them money is a way to encourage them and show your trust to them.
8.0	Some children will work harder after you do this behavior and closer to the parents.
2.0	These are the reasons which can prove my opinion that parents offer their childre money for each higher grade they get in school
3.0	Nowadays parents offering their children money for high grades marks seems normal and has it meaning.
3.0	It is a way of reward with can help children gain interest for study and purse hidh grades, which is exactly the goal of their studying.
11.0	But I think it is not a good idea.
11.0	Reason as follows.
5.0	First offering money seems to encourage children's studying , but it can't arouse their real interest for studying.
8.0	What push them to study is the happiness of receiving money.
8.0	If parents stop offering this, it's hard to say whter they can remain passion for studying.
8.0	It can't build the habit of life long study, and not suitble for their afterwards studying life.
8.0	What their needs is the real interest for studying.
8.0	Only the interesting to studying itself can continue their study to life long.
8.0	Many of the scientists come from a poor background, but their interest for study help them conquer the hardness and make a meaning.
8.0	Like the case of Chengjingun, who had too little money to maintain his life and died in poverty, it is  his interest to math that assist him to make really amazing discovery.
8.0	For the children offered money to study, they can't conquer the hardness when all resourses gone and only study remains, and they can't conquer the hardness and  make real discovery.
8.0	So what important is the interest for study itself, not interst for money.
5.0	Secong, money award may form a wrong idea for them.
8.0	They may gain the idea that what important is the thing that can make them directly happy, like money.
8.0	They can't know the happiness when all the hardness conquered and finally know what really matters in life.
8.0	With this idea the only study ther superficial part of the subject ,for they have already got what makes them happy, and can't study deeper.
2.0	So in my view,money awards only have instant effect, but  is not a suitable way to encourage children to study.
3.0	In the modren society, hleping to each other is familiar thing.
12.0	People clerly know that it is very hard for them to live in urban.
8.0	when they see or hear something that one should be hleped, they will undoubtly hlep to her.
8.0	However, there are two conditions, one person who is your friend have any ambition and another one is the struggling stranger.
8.0	People would be more willing to help the strangers but struggling.
6.0	Firstly, in most of people's view, they think quality is more important for one.
9.0	Indeed, a struggling persom has grater probability of success, even though now he seems to very poor of money or status.
9.0	but who can accurate predict the future about a struggling person.
12.0	In recent decades, for children's high grade, some parents tend to use moneny to encourage kids to study hard.
8.0	Although it seems like a good idea, children are likely to study only for moneny.
8.0	Once the parents don't offer moneny anymore, children may get annoyed and lose the interest in study.
8.0	Therefore, I firmly disagree the opinion that children will be offered with moneny for their good grade.
12.0	Today, there is a hot topic: whether it is essential for people to know about events which unlikely affect your daily life.
12.0	Answers vary from person to person.
11.0	Some people think they do not need to receive news which is irrelavant to their daily life.
11.0	Contrary to their views comes my opinion that people should know about events occuring from the whole world, even though they had nothing to do people's life.
5.0	To begin with, gaining the news from the whole world helps open up people's view.
8.0	It is acknowleded that different countries have different cultures, ideas, values and believes, and each one has its own strength and disadvantages.
8.0	If people can keep gaining news of other countries' events, they are more likely to have the ability of embracing difference which contributes their views to be more opened.
8.0	By contrast, the person who is only willing to receive the events occuring around their daily life could have limited concepts to the world.
8.0	It is hard for them to embrace difference, thus they are more likelt to be stubborn.
8.0	In this case, they might lose lots of chance of gaining valuable knowledge or interesting things.
5.0	Moreover, knowing about other countries events benefits people to live a better life.
8.0	It is because people see many kinds of lifestyles from different countries.
8.0	There are diverse types of occupation and food and climates in the whole world, so they can find some types of lifestyles which they are eager to have or are suitable in.
8.0	In this case, they can totally change their orginal lifestyle and pursue their favorite one.
8.0	My aunt's experience is a good case in this point.
8.0	When she was young, she liked to see the news of events happening in the whole world.
8.0	Her enthusiasm to the animals pushes her to immigrate to Australia, since she found Australian live in harmony with animals.
8.0	Now, she lives in her favorite life.
2.0	In general, I think it is essential to know about things ocurring the whole world.
11.0	Nowadays, there are more and more people choose to travel to  relax themselves during certain vacation, and they will always face two choice whether travel in group led by a tour guide or go alone.
11.0	Some people may tend to travel alone, since it will be more liberty to being alone.
12.0	Others, howeber, may against woth the above oponion that it will be more combenient to be led by a tour guide.
11.0	As I see it, travel within a goup will be better.
4.0	First and foremost, it is no doubted that it wouldbe much easier for us to prepare everything before travel if we travel in a group, since alost everything will be considered by tour guide, such as order totel, manage toute and even bisit what kinds of scenery spots.
10.0	And this what we need to do is just go with tour guide and admire various stages of nature and different place.
4.0	Additionally, it will always take too much time for is to learn about where we pretend to vusut without the help of tour guide, and people are now become more and more busy, and the reason for them to travel is to relax themselves and get rid of the live which all arranged by themselves, moreober, we will have chance to know some people who share rhe same interest with us in the group, and it will be much happy make griend with such people during our tourism.
4.0	Last but not least, although, some people may said that it will be alittle hurry to travel led by a tour guide, neverthelessm since out schedual is arranged by the tour guides who are very sophiscated avout certain places and following with them will definitely the best choice since we can go many places within limited time which is impossible for the people who travel to a new place by themselves.
10.0	Also, we will know much about certain spot with the introduction of tour guide and it will be much easer for is to rememver the thing about the scenery.
2.0	In a word, it is obiously better to travel in a group with the help of tour guide.
3.0	It is common for us to hear that some parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.
3.0	Actually,my mom had tried to done this thing for me before.
12.0	But I refused.
4.0	Some people think it is a good idea as it may improve children's enthusiasm of the study.
10.0	And the others may think it's not a good idea for it's not an unmixed motor for students to learn.
4.0	As we all know.
8.0	money for adults is an important thing and it is a useful thing to promote people's work effeciency.
8.0	However,for children,it may not as important as it for adults.
8.0	In my opinion, whether this is a good idea depends on the children's personalities and thoughts.
4.0	For personalities,if the children are keen on using money,money can be a great factor and they may work harder on their study to gain the money from their parents.
10.0	Howener, if the children isn't thirsty to shopping,it can't be a useful factor.
4.0	For thoughts,for example,I don't like to receive extra money from my parents besides the neccesary,The reason is easy to understand that when I get a better grade I receive money from my parents therefore I have to bear their anger or blame when sometimes my grade isn't good.
8.0	Or rather, I think if I accept the money from my parents when the mask is great, it seems that I study for them instead of myself.
8.0	This thought made me refuse to gain money from my parents according to my grade.
8.0	But if some students are willing to accept their parents' money when the grade is good, the idea that offering money for them is proper.
1.0	In a word, whether the idea is good that offering chilren money according to their grade varies person to person.
1.0	The essential factors are the chilren's personalities and thoughts.
3.0	First of all, we can realize that comparing the good relation and the hard studying consequense that the good relationship is easier, because it might not that we cost a lot of time in studying hard and we can just spend some money in social communication to get success easier.
11.0	But as my opinion, I think the people studying hard will achieve the success in the future job, because of tough portery.
6.0	There has a lot of example of hard working people but less for getting success relying on good relation.
8.0	Because this kind of people have a more valuable character, the endeavor, to touch the success.
8.0	I really like a famous NBA superstar, Kobe Bryent, who got a lot of personal award and awarded five chiampion rings.
8.0	Working hard and crazy trainning were the Kobe's sward to beat more and more players in front of him, because many audients and critics thought Kobe was less of brilience.
8.0	Have you seen the sightness on 4:00 am in Los, which is said by Kobe, as same as he said, his career points exceed Jordan by working hard without using his bad relationship.
8.0	So as the same way, if we study hard, we will get success at the final.
2.0	Furthemore, we can imagine that after hard studying we will gain too much acknownlege, and that's the people who just has good relationship less.
7.0	Many leaders or white collars
11.0	I do not figure that this is a good idea.
11.0	When we meet a problem of education, it could be more serious than we might think.
11.0	Sometimes what the parents do to teach their kids may have a long effect on thire observation of the world.
4.0	At first, I could understand that the idea means to make students desire to get better grades.
8.0	But what important is that what attract the school-age most may not be the money.
8.0	As for me, what I want most during my school age is to hang out with my friends.
8.0	So maybe find some extrotic creatures and find the names and habits of them with me may be a more effective way for my parents to make me study more, rather than giving me extra money to induce me.
4.0	And in my opinion using money as a sort of wage for getting good grads may make the children getting into the secuence of sosiety earlier, which may not be a good thing.
10.0	Children with a chilhood like that intend to have some problems with their growing.
4.0	On the other hand, I don't think the study grade is everything.
8.0	Students study with their interest and creativity always make unexpectable efforts, while those work with inducing and compolsory jobs usually find it a wasting time.
8.0	Maybe letting them do what they like is the better way to help them grow with happiness and be a true man.
8.0	Of coures studing is important, but it's just a part of the education, isn't it?
0.0	Of course every parents hope thier children to be the best and the most outstanding one.
0.0	But the desire to money is definitly not the best choice for inspiring them.
0.0	After all, they are just kids and they deserve kids' ways to observe the world.
3.0	I disagree with this sentence.
3.0	I think people today are not more willing to help the struggling strangers.
3.0	In our real life, we can see many beggars on the road to beg  for many reason:he doesn't have enough many for the ticket to go home;he just lost his wallet or he dosen't eat for 3 days.....
11.0	These situations are more and more common in our life,especially in the center of city.
4.0	I saw this situation in last week too.
8.0	When I was at the station of ZHONGSHAN Park,a man talked to me and asked for some many to buy the ticket.
8.0	I asked him where he want to go,and bought a ticket for him.
8.0	Then I leave.
4.0	But when I went back to the station after 1 hour,I saw him again.
9.0	He was still begging for money.
9.0	At that time,I was so disappointed and angry----He had just cheated me,I was so stupid that I didn't realized he just want money, not the ticket.
4.0	In my opinion,there are so many situations like this in our life.
8.0	They might not really the struggling people,they don't need helps at all and they just ask for money.
8.0	At first, I think many people like me, want to help them.
8.0	"We give them some  bread or help them buy the ticket which they are really ""want""."
8.0	But after that, we realized that they have cheated us.
8.0	When we have expierenced those situations,we will not so willing to help the struggling strangers.
8.0	We start to worry if it's true or not.
8.0	Of courese some of them are true,but a majority of them are cheaters.
1.0	"Today,more and more cheaters like these start to ""work"" on the road to dress up as""struggling strangers""."
1.0	People now are not so willing because they afraid of be deceived.
3.0	With the development of economic and internet,many youngers are admittetd to famous entertainters whom sing a song in  good voice or a athletes whom play great games in the sport TV.
3.0	Because of it , many youngers think that this famous people are more important to them than to older people .
12.0	In my opion ,to younger people,the opinons of celebrities are more importent,here is my some reasons.
6.0	Firstly,the famous entertainters and athletes can make younger people learn them and play hard in studying or working,for which ,younger people have more motivation to get good grades.
8.0	However,the order people shoudn't do so much efford toget some thing ,since they hane enough life.
8.0	For example,Kobe ,the famous basketeball player in NBA.
8.0	He did so much practice when he had no games.
8.0	He said he knew about Los Angles at 4 o'clock A.M.A large namber of younger learn his mental,but the olders wouldn,t do that .
8.0	Because it is not neccessarily.
10.0	second the o
3.0	Nowadays, more and more teachers make their social or political views known to students in the classroom.
12.0	Besides, lots of people approval of it, because they think it is helpful to students in their future life in society.
11.0	However, I believe it is a ridculous idea, because it have the order reversed.
5.0	On the one hand, studing knowledge is the main obiligation for students.
8.0	Teaching social or political views to students will make them distracted and it waste the precious time in class.
8.0	Honestly, teaching social and political view is unuseful to students to improve their scores.
8.0	If students can not get a great grade in exam, they will be hardly to find a good job and be easy to be failure in the future.
8.0	In this case, these socials and political views are useless at all.
8.0	The most improtant and basic affair is study hard and fight for a good grade.
8.0	The social points and poltical opinions are minor assignments.
8.0	In this case, these views are supposed to be shalled with students afterclass but not in the class.
5.0	One the other hand, the social and political views are always personal view, which is not objective.
8.0	The teachers are supposed to teach student to treat everything in a fair way, and these view are possible to effect students' jugement of their own.
8.0	It is absolutely inadviseable.
8.0	There is no doubt that thinking indepentent is of vital under no sircustence.
8.0	It is an allful
0.0	All in all, I do not delay the significance of making teachers' social or politcal views known to students, but it should not be done in the classroom.
0.0	The classroom is the place serves students to concentrated on their studying not the thing which is unconcerned about studying.
0.0	So that, the idea that teachers make their social or political views to students in the classroom makes no sense.
3.0	Nowadays, with the development of technology and the interaction of different fields, the works need to try different tasks.
12.0	Some people contend that this opinion benefits works, and the works could update their minds and adopt the new tasks.
11.0	While other disagree this opinion, and claims that it could give the works more perssure.
11.0	In my opinion, I agree with the former one.
5.0	To begin with, trying different tasks could refresh the workers' minds and stimulate them more creative ideas.
8.0	Looking back of some old ironic moive about the big factory era in London.
8.0	Many workers must do the same job in the factory whole day.
8.0	It is so boring and tiring.
8.0	During the working period, the workers almost stop thinking and they just do the same movement unintentionally.
8.0	In a long time, they usually are unwilling to thinking, which causes them hard to try a new job in the future.
8.0	While, if they are usually offered by different taskes, they must change thier minds fast in order to accomplish different tasks.
8.0	In this process, different assignment also could offer creative minds.
8.0	In other words, they could use the method from one field to solve the problems in another field.
5.0	In addition, offering different tasks could help works adopt the cutting-edge technology and adjust their working arrangement.
8.0	To be specific, it could support them more information about different majors or fields.
8.0	Taking myself as an example, my major is Geography Information System.
8.0	Two years ago, my working experence is simple that I usually collected the geo-information on the internet and made some geography tables.
8.0	With the development of big data, I also needed to do some tasks about data analyse.
8.0	Though it was very hard and I must learn much revelent knowledge, I found it is very effective way to solve the geographic problems.
8.0	In summay, taking different tasks could open people's minds and realize the right working derection.
0.0	I admit it is easier to do similar tasks all day long, which costs lower energy.
0.0	However, if you are the person, who dose not want to face the problems.
0.0	I also recommend you to take different tasks which could help you realize what kind of job is more suitable for you.
3.0	With the accelerate of society, adults spend more time on cellphone, so students do.
3.0	Therefore, some parents begin to complain the phenomone that educating students was more difficult than before.
11.0	In my opinion, I don't agree with this that educating is more difficult nowadays.
4.0	First and foremost, the social networking could lead students to know more relative knowledge with the area which they have gift in.
8.0	As the net word is so important that many new findings will be reported by the mass media.
8.0	Students could follow the authority by twitter and so on.
8.0	Then they could get the details not noticed in textbooks.
4.0	Besides, playing game also can excesice the ablity the students have.
8.0	there are many details wihch need people conclude in the game.
8.0	The details decides the important aspect in game, at the same time, requier lots of canculation which need be completed by players.
8.0	Like Arzu Lane and so on.
8.0	In that case, this would be a choice that improve students ablity.
4.0	Last but not least, nowadays students could make friends in games which are accepted by the people who has same hobby.
8.0	Because that they could play a same game and have intrest in it.
8.0	As for my friends, they have the same interest in anime game, therefore, they get together and exchange the experience of Jeapenese study.
8.0	Whatsmore, they even go to the cm last winter.
8.0	They both have progress in their Jeapense studying.
1.0	Above all,  I don't agree with this that educating is more difficult nowadays.
1.0	Because it could help with us study, And get better greads.
12.0	I think it is a good idea.
8.0	To some degree,one get encouragement from this mode.
8.0	And he will bocome accustomed to working hard for getting paid.
8.0	He wouldn't dream about having free dinner,but enjoying every part of salary after hard-working instead.
8.0	He'll take it for granted.
8.0	In his opinion,enjoying without paying is a strange and banned thing.
6.0	How high one can climb in the society depend on how massive he behaves.
10.0	Only when a child understand that everything he own should be caught by himself,he is able to be a independent,reliable and attractive adult man.
11.0	I do not agree with the statement that it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise .
11.0	In my opnion doing physical exercise is the best way to relax after a hard working or learning.
12.0	As you all know , life lies in motion.
11.0	Now let me talk about why relax by doing physical exercise is better.
5.0	First , after a whole day working or learning ,you sit so many times and your body is so weak that is not fit for sitting any more.
8.0	At that time if you still sit and watch a movie or read a book ,it is bad for your health.
8.0	Because you do not change your body's situation and you body will still be tired.
8.0	It is running in the opposite direction .
8.0	So we should do some exercise which can refresh our body and brain.
5.0	Moreover, do physical exercise can make you feel getting in the society.
8.0	You can  have communication with some strangers and then you may recive new friendship though doing exercise which may make you feel pleased towards hard life.
8.0	There is an example to prove it.
8.0	One day ,when i was in primary school, i was so weak in my  math.
8.0	In other words , i had many trouble in my math .
8.0	After a whole day 's learning math,i was so tired that can not say anything.
8.0	I was sad on way return to home .
8.0	At that time my classmater mike call me ,he wanted me to go play football with him ,soi agree with that comments.
7.0	I meet and talk with many other students and i was
3.0	Last month, my math teacher, Tony, asked us to accomplish assignement about geometry in groups.
3.0	However, some students determined to fulfill the task by themselves.
3.0	Later, the students who decided to do assignment performed terriblely.
3.0	Neither they found some new ideas to solve the problem, nor they used the primitive way to get the answer.
3.0	Well, recently, an interesting question comes out whether a student learn much more effectively than when they are asked to work alone on projects, when teachers assign projects on which students must work together.
11.0	Some people may choose to work alone cause they do not want to be distracted.
9.0	However, according to what I experienced before, I definitely comply the teachers' order and believe that the teacher is right.
9.0	Here are some ideas and example to support my view.
6.0	To begin with, teachers may consider that the task is very hard for the individual.
8.0	So working in groups may improve the study efficiency.
8.0	However, if one decides to do it alone, he or she might not solve the problem and waste much of time with nothing worked out.
8.0	For instance, according to the experience before, my teacher Tony, obviously realized that the geometry might be hard for us.
8.0	In order to help us accquire much knowledge, he asked us to work together.
8.0	Finally, my group succeeded to solve the problem with the help of each other.
8.0	In contrast, the students who try to do it alone work out nothing.
0.0	Secondly, working together may help us broad our views and exposes us with the new ideas raised by others.
0.0	There is no doubt that students need to discuss when they work in group.
0.0	Last time, our biology teacher asked us to do a survey in my campus and designed a new way to learn the birds.
8.0	My teamate Tom designed an efficient experiment to get the information from the birds and everone is impressed by this experiment.
8.0	At last, we got the first prize in the final evaluation.
8.0	Clearly, working together could help ones learn a lot.
11.0	As people being older nowadays, there are more and more people who need help in the world.
11.0	Also,  I agree with the opinion wihch says people today are more enthusiastic in the aspect of help struggling strangers.
5.0	The knowledge let them to be respact.
8.0	We can't conseal the turth that the impact of the particular of the struggling strangers in all areas.
8.0	Them always paid more energy in the area the like then the people who usually be distrupted by other useless things.
8.0	Besides, in this way, they have the same right to say what they agree or disagree as we have.
8.0	Then they will be famouse, more students could help them.
8.0	And the same the students could get wisness they want.
5.0	The struggling strangers is a part of the world we living, the countries pay more attention on the group of volenteers who want to help struggling people.
9.0	By doing this more and more people who suffeer from struggling could be more happy, although they meigh don't have a famous fingings.
9.0	As they have the right to enjoy the life, we cannot deny this.
0.0	Comparing from the past and now, it is not difficult to find that the  to the struggling strangers.
0.0	In the past they was a symbol of the attach of the world.
0.0	But recently they could reacher their dreams as we can.
3.0	One difening character of people is degree to which keep their privacy.
12.0	The one side think that famous people do not need to protect their privacy beecause they are supposed to express themselves even theie privacy, they have to be transparent.
12.0	Another side contends that everyone has to maintain their privacy even the famous people.
11.0	In my perspective, I strongly ageree wit the second, there are three specific points to support my opinion.
4.0	First of all,  as everyone known that people have right to maintai  their privacy which is a commonsence even the famous people.
8.0	In moraliliy, people has to be educated that is necessary to protect ownselfs privacy.
8.0	For instance, back to elmentary schoolo, my teachers always  underscored that privacy is really important likewise your life.
8.0	That might be your secret that do not need allow everyone know,  such as the astrategy of  family or others.
8.0	Too many sccrets or privacies are realate to the weakness of people.
8.0	If privacy is revail, it's harmful to suffering people.
8.0	So famous people are same with normal people, we need to attention that.
4.0	Secondly, we know  that famous people are busy to work, if people greatly ecplore their privacy, which will result a big harm to them.
9.0	For example, pop stars have to transport to everywhhere like music festive.
9.0	It has to make them lack of sleeping time, if people still explores their privacy, then stars will suffer a huge psychological offensive, some fregile stars might be retired after that.
4.0	Finally, everyone to attention on the social manner.
8.0	Exploring someone's privacy is harmful to them even a little.
8.0	For example, someone who do not know the social manner, they just kidding some body, but has attacked them.
8.0	Furthermore, according to the social manner, we need to respect other's privacy and do not explores that.
2.0	In conclusion, everyone must respect other's privacy even famous people.
3.0	Whatever in the past time or nowedays, working is necessary for everyone.
11.0	But finding a job that we like and will be successful in the future is difficult.
11.0	So we need to depend on ourselves or another tool to indentify the potential of different kinds of job.
11.0	And we can see, our society is becoming more and more prosperous.
10.0	People can obtain more source to help them find the truth, learn about themselves, even include looking for a potential job.
5.0	First, in that day, we can learn more information through any instruments such as computer, mobile phone, and ect.
8.0	We can master information that come from different fields.
8.0	Thus, our field is extended.
8.0	We can depend on these messages to make a more reasonable decision.
8.0	Instead, in the past time, people cannot know about enough information.
8.0	Most time, when they think about one thing, they just rely on their experience to make it.
8.0	And, sometimes some expericen is wrong, so they will be misleaded.
8.0	For example, in the previous, my father want to be an journalist, but my grandparents are not supporting my father's opinion.
8.0	This is because in that time just a few people hear about this career, so most peole will thinks obtaning that job is difficult.
8.0	But because my father lean about this job deeply in college, so he still persist his idea.
8.0	In the end, the fields of media is becoming better and better.
8.0	Therefore, it provens that depending on the experience to think about the objects is wrong.
5.0	Second, in the modern day, there are a lot of experts that can analyze the working situation.
8.0	If we have cofusion about the future job, we can ask them for help.
8.0	And they can analyze this job from different aspects, we can gain more accurate information.
8.0	However, in the previous, it is hard for us to communicate with these people.
8.0	And these experts in that time, their field of knowledge is smaller than modern days.
8.0	For example, nowedays if we interested in some job, we can find these experts to talk about these queation, in this process, we are not only know about the requirements of these job, we even can find more sutiable job for us.
8.0	So in the future, we do not have larger losing.
1.0	Finally, in that day, people can enjoy better educational source, and their livinig level is raised up.
1.0	So they will own their opinion about anything in the life.
7.0	They can rely on themselves to design their plan about life and
3.0	Have you ever annoyed by your parents because they always replace you to do various decision?
3.0	However, in the past many youths are pleased with thier parents to help them make their decision.
11.0	I think there are several reasons about it.
4.0	First, young people could obtain enough information about their decision from advanced technology.
8.0	Nowadys the development of those digital devices are prospect, so many people like to make some comment on different website like microblog and the communication among people are improved a lot.
8.0	Therefore, if the modern young people need to make a decision, most of them would like to attain more specific message by overview the professional views by strangers, or communicate with other friends who are familliar to this area.
8.0	Nevertheless, the children in ancient did not have such devices, so the only thing they could rely on is their parents.
4.0	In addtion, the decision of ancient people due to their background.
8.0	In ancient times, most of the countries are in the war.
8.0	And the most considerate things are food, clothes,water, or life.
8.0	So the youth could live better when they accepted their parents advices, because parents have better ability in such areas and they could consider things more rounded.
8.0	For example, their parents wanted the children to leave home to another save places, like schools, and ancient kids always comply with their parents.
8.0	However, the children nowadays have rights to object with their parents.
4.0	Finally, the mind set among ancient children and modern children are diffrent.
9.0	Kid in ancient have more conventional mind set, and they thought complying with parents is the obligation for children.
9.0	But nowadys, more people recommend the equal status, and more parents are like childrens' friends, they could have argument, own different views.
1.0	Whatever, we still depend on our parents to some extent even today.
1.0	So we could have a discussion with our parents, their advice is professional and experienced, and absorb from other people' s advice then make
3.0	On the contemporary society, work stress has been more and more heavy.
3.0	I heard many news salesman had died due to work extra hours.
3.0	It sounds unbelievable but long time work can actually cause danger.
3.0	If your boss give you two choices,the one is to work only three days a week for long hours, another is to have a job that you need work five days a week for shorter hours,which will you choose?
11.0	I prefer the last one,due to the following reasons.
4.0	First,the essential advantage is that work five days for shorter time is better for our health.
8.0	You just need finish your work during the five days, so that you will not fell pressure and can make yourself relax.
8.0	On the contrary,nothing can be worse than deal with your work within three days.
8.0	Just like I mentioned the news before,I had a cousin called Joe who always forget his homework because of other entertainment.
8.0	One summer vacation,he addcited in his new video game,so that he fogot his homework before three days of the ending of the vocation.
8.0	And then he writed his homework within this three days.
8.0	In the end, he finished his homework but also got a heavy fever because at that time he spent too much time on homework so that he did not have any meal.
4.0	Second,work at shorter time can  give me more time to concentrate on my work because if I have to finish my work for three days I will spend four days for relaxing.
10.0	It is opbviously not good for me to pay more attention on my work,also not efficient.
4.0	What's more,I can have more free time eveyday if I choose to work for five days.
9.0	I can make good use of the rest of days.
9.0	Just like review and cheak my work or do something I prefer to do, just like sports or watch a movie for fun.
2.0	According to the reasons  mentioned above, I prefer to work five days a week for shorter hours.
11.0	Since the university is one of the most important institutions in education field, our country is eager to educate more wise graduations to work for it and make our life much better.
11.0	From my perspective, spending more money on salaries for university professors is a good way to improve the quality of education.
5.0	First of all, increasing the professors' salaries will stur their enthusiam for education.
8.0	Owing to the fact that some professors have so few money that they have to do something else to make a liveing, increasing salary is the most direct way to lenify their financial burden.
8.0	Thus they can spare more time on educating students and the quality of education will surely be improved.
8.0	For example, many professors in the university get little salary so they ask their postgraduates to do things that are not related to their major, which is just a waste of time and source for this kind of things do not goods to their ability to solve problems in their major field.
8.0	However, salary increse will make them more concentrate on their work and digest more knowledge.
5.0	Second, university professors can buy a laptop of high quailty for most of computers distributed by the university have became out of date, which can increase the efficience while working.
7.0	For many of our work are heavely relied on computers, a laptop of high quality is the most efficient way to
3.0	Can you imagine what things would like to be if more professional professors appear in universities but the very young children don't have a good educational background?
12.0	It is obvious that there will be a myriad of children miss a good chance to receive better education because the government spends more money on unversities, and the students in universities haven't changed a lot because they don't really care whether their college has more better professors or their campus have received more money for their education, they just care whether they can pass the final exam of the universitiy.
5.0	Few things can be more effective than investing fundation on the education of very young children because we these young children represent the hope and prospect of our nation.
10.0	As we all know the bedrock of the knowledge is the most significant to a student, and this just confirms that we should pay more attention to the children's education, so it must be a necessity to spend more money on young students' education because we need to give them better education to cultivate them better habits of studying.
5.0	While for the universities, there is no need to spend more money on the education of college.
8.0	This is because there is an increasing number of universities have fairly high level educational system or professors.
8.0	And on the other hand, we should have known that college students should be self-control enough to get what they anticipate to achieve, and it is not about whether professors or studying facilities are good enough or not, it is totally depends on students themselves.
8.0	As a result, to spend the money on a more appropriate place, it is a wise choice to invest these money on education of young children.
2.0	To summarize, although the students in colleges have more knowledge than children, for the potential, we must spend the money on right place.
3.0	Nowadays works on school has been a topic for many students and it causes a topic that whether the students learn much more effectively than when they are asked to work alone on projects when teachers assign projects on which students must work together.
3.0	This divides students into two different camps with opposite opinions, and some students would like to hold the opinion that the students will learn much more effectively when work alone.
12.0	However, I prefer working together with others, and there are reasons and examples that can illustrate my opinions.
5.0	First and foremost, working with others makes it possible for the students to have more ideas.
8.0	To be more specific, when a group of students are discussing a problem, they will come up with different opinions, and then they can think of every ideas and combine them together in order to get a better answer and save time.
8.0	In opposition, if students just work alone, they can not come up with so many ideas at the same time and they will spend quite a lot of time in order to get an answer which can be slow and not so efficient.
8.0	For example, one of my best friends, who always like to attend group study, said that every time when he is in a group, they can think out so many ideas and they will compare these ideas and select the best one, then in this way they can not only save time, but also get the best answer.
5.0	In the second place, with group studying, students get more access to a better method which can help them be more efficiently.
8.0	This is because when students study together, if they meet a problem, different people will came up with different solutions, and they can all learn from each other, in this way, they can even learn so many ways just from one question which can help them improve their ability in studying that can help them to be more efficiently.
8.0	In opposition, when students work alone, they meet the same trouble, they can not turn to others for help, instead they will spend quite a lot of time for this problem and they may even get the wrong answer that may waste them a lot of time.
8.0	Let's take myself as an example, once when I was in a  group, we discuss a math probelm and different people have different methods to solve this, then we begin to discuss every methods and every one can learn so many methods  that can help them improve their ability in math.
0.0	Granted, it may be reasonable and attractive that some poeple claim that when teachers assign projects on which students must work together, students will learn more efficiently if they work alone, since when students work alone, they don't have to use the time to dicuss with others which can help them save time and use it to learn more.
0.0	However, it can not hold water, since if students don't discuss, they will make mistakes quite often, as a result they will spend even more time to check and revise the mistake which can even waste them more time.
0.0	So I am still convinced by my standpoint that students will learn more effectively when work together.
3.0	Nomarlly, most parents will give their school-age children rewards like money when they get high mark in the school but also have some perents disagree it.
3.0	They maybe think their children get good grade is a regular thing.
12.0	In my opinion, perents reward their school-age children money when they get high mark each time, i strongly agree.
12.0	I have some reasons to supprot my opinion.
9.0	Fristly, perents reward their school-age children money and incent and encourge their children.
9.0	Secondly, perents can use the rewards to teach and foster their children's capacity of manage money.
6.0	Frist at all, parents reward their chlidren money can encourge and motivate their chilren.
8.0	Children will aware: if they achieve their tasks and missions well, parents will get their rewards.
8.0	That is evey significant, because children will strive and presist to complete their rasks and missions well.
8.0	For example, when i am a school-age children, my parents always encourge me to learn better, which study is my task when i am a teenage, i got high
3.0	Having a glinpse of the current situation in children's study, we may be marvel at their heavy burden of homework and significant pressure from activities.
3.0	To cope with their homework and activities organization, children have to spend more time in them.
5.0	To begin with, children in these days have to work harder to meet their parents' expectation.
8.0	Parents always hope that their children will be richer or more knowledge than them or at least as successful as them.
8.0	However, as more and more parents of children accepted high education it is more difficult to satisfy this requirment.
8.0	For instanse, my grandparents don't have collage degree, so they wished my parents to go to university and they made it, then my parents except me to get a master degree.
8.0	As a result, I have to be more hard-working in my school.
5.0	In addition, when judging students university consider not noly their grades but also their activities experience, which leads children to spend more time organizing activities.
8.0	To enter their dream school, children have to spend more time doing homework to get high grades and participating club activities to enrich their experience.
8.0	For example, I joint a sport club when I was in high school and it hold meeting every week.
8.0	On the contrary, my parents didn't have these activities at their high school.
10.0	Nevertheless, the fierce competetion in finding a  job makes children studying harder.
2.0	Consequently, children in these days spend more time focusing on their homework and activites.
3.0	"Some parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school as a reward for their""well-being""."
12.0	From my point of view,this kind of move is not benefical in the long run and may bring bad influence on their children.
4.0	First thing first,getting high grades is not an extra part of school work and literally it is a duty.
8.0	As a student,the major work is to study and perform well which can be measured by their grades.
8.0	Thus the high grades children get should be seen as a thing that children is supposed to do just like the circumstance that factory workers perform their duties well or the president runs the country well.
8.0	For children,parents will give them money  for their need.
8.0	Children do not get paid money by their study,all they have to do is perform well academically.
4.0	Second,if children are given money each time they get a high grade,they will always expect for more.
9.0	And if they don`t get a high grade,the loss for them will be larger as neither do they get a high grade nor get the money they used to be given by their parents.
9.0	This would be so frustrated that children may not be able to overcome.
4.0	Third,giving children money as a reward can possibly have a bad impact on children`s finance view.
9.0	Through this move,money is closely connected to the certain amount of achievement they get and that is going to have the children form a benthamism mind,leading to the children`s caring too much about the outcome and neglecting the significance of the process.
9.0	Step by step,it`s likely for children to do some inappropraite things in order to get their misson completed and get the reward which they do not actually deserve.
10.0	So,it is unwise for parents ton
3.0	Peole are concerned with how much intervention parents should take to prevent their children from making mistakes.
3.0	In my opinion, parents should allow their children to make mistakes and learn from them.
3.0	Although many mistakes would have severe consequences, the benefits of making mistakes far outwights its drawbakcs.
3.0	There are many benefits of learning from one's experience.
3.0	The greaest inventor Edison had made numerous mistakes before he succedded to discover the best material that is suited for the wires of light bulbs.
11.0	Making mistakes become the best opportunity for the young generation to discover their mistakes instead of relying on their parents to solve them.
4.0	After facing the consequences of certain mistakes, children may realize the importance of making improvements to avoid these mistakes.
8.0	One of my classmates in high school used to prepare poorly for exams.
8.0	However, his parents didn't take an active role in convincing him to review for exams.
8.0	I expected that he wouldn't take actions to compensate for his fault.
8.0	I was surprised to know that his manner changed abruptly after the award ceremony.
8.0	I could tell that he felt depressed about not earning any distinction, and to earn distinctions became his motivation for studying hard.
8.0	As a result, he studied much harder and succeeded in the following tests.
4.0	Furthermore, the process of making mistakes helps people to discover their own defects.
8.0	It may be favorable for parents to guide their children.
8.0	However, this is not beneficial in the long run.
8.0	Children have to learn about the causes of these mistakes to better prevent them.
8.0	The process of precluding mistakes for children actually disables them to learn about  origins of the mistakes.
8.0	"An idomatic expression goes ""to grant people fish is not as helpful as to teach people how to catch the fish""."
8.0	Although parents may prevent children from suffering the consequences of mistakes, they may not be able to help thier children if they make such mistakes in the future.
8.0	After all, the children have to be independent.
4.0	Admittedly, parents can help their children to learn about mistakes.
8.0	Parents have broader experience of the society, so that they may predict what kind of mistakes their children may encounter.
8.0	In this aspect, parental supports can help their children from making mistakes.
8.0	However, the society is constantly chaning, what is applicable to the parent's generation may not be applicable to the children.
8.0	Therefore, parents should allow children to explore the world on thier own.
0.0	In general, making mistakes is an integral part of the children's growth.
0.0	Without it, children may not realize the significance of these mistakes.
0.0	They may not know how to stop making them.
0.0	Parental control is helpful only when there is room for children to develop thier own approach to experiencing and solving mistakes.
11.0	As the world changing rapidly, more and more people can benefit from high developing society.
11.0	It seems like people nowadays are much happier than people in the past.
12.0	However, personally, I strongly believe that people nowadays are actually less happy with their lives compare to the people in the past.
4.0	To begin with, people nowadays have more information to process, which make their lives more exhausting than ever.
8.0	Due to the limitation of information transaction, people in the past don't have the chance to know too much about world, their livestyle is simple because they only need to do works base on their current knowledge.
8.0	Comparing to them, people nowdays have much more pressure.
8.0	Everyday tons of information bombard us and make us revalue everything around us.
8.0	For example, a report says the top university is xx and another renowned news paper says otherwise.
8.0	True and false information weive together and buffle people.
8.0	Unlike people in the past, they could satisfy with going into a university, nowadays people would still unhappy about whether the university they came is the bast one.
8.0	More information cause less satisfying with life.
4.0	Secondly, people nowadays have more targets which make them less happy.
8.0	In the past, the major goal of people is to maintain their lives and only satisfy their basic needs, but in the nowadays society, people seek more than sustain basic needs.
8.0	To demostrate, people seek fashion dresses, expensive luxuries and everything could make them feel good.
8.0	In fact, lots of them are unnessecery purchasing which bacome burden to nowadays people.
8.0	Plus, those fashion stuff change over time.
8.0	Today's fashion maybe a coat and tomorrow could be a hat.
8.0	People always have more to conern, to persue, so actually they are less satisfied than before.
4.0	Finally, quick changing represents people nowadays need to do more work so they can correspond with the world.
9.0	In the past people could do work slowly, like a peasant could manage his one arce land regularly for this own life but if he is in the nowadays society, he has to do more work, manage more arces of land and hire more people to help organize the land, or he won't be able to catch the quick changing world and be left out.
9.0	Thus, people nowadays are forced to rise their work speed to synchronize with the rapidly changing world.
2.0	To put into a nut shell, people nowadays are less happy than people in the past because more information bring them more concerns, they have more persuation to make them happy and they have to do more works or be left out by the quick changing world.
12.0	School-age children are awarded money from their parents ,who obtain high grade in school.
11.0	I don't agree with that idea,to some degree.
6.0	There is no doubted that money facilitates childen to study hard.
8.0	That is because children gain money,they can buy the newest toys,mold cars or something like that.
8.0	That is the noly reason for child to study.
8.0	And if you stop to give money to children who performed well in exams,the children will give up studying,too.
8.0	Children are too young to realize that studying is not only for money but for friendship,knowledge,capability and so on.
8.0	What if you struggle to do that?
8.0	Children will be of capitalism,having no love.
0.0	Whereas parents don't offer their school-age kids money,kids will get a good commond of knowledge for achieving their dreams,making acquaintance with others and saving money.
0.0	Owing to love toys,children have to earn money.
0.0	Then they will be aware of that earning money is not such an easy thing.
0.0	Then their parents will tell them that if you wanna buy your own things ,you shouId ues your own money.
0.0	In a bid to purchase their favorite toys,they will ask their parents how can i get my money ,parents will say that study hard and work hard,then you will get paid.
9.0	No pains No gains.
9.0	If you do house work,we may pay your money.
7.0	Then children learn how to argue,do house work,and slef-discplined
11.0	From this topic, I think this is a good idea for me.
12.0	School-age children are children exactly, so, what the parents do to encourage and appreciated them is more cardinal for chldren who get a high grade.
5.0	During the time when I was 10 years old, I have a few of entertainments such as playing, surfing on the internet, reading and so on.
8.0	Even though I was very delightful about them.
8.0	It's so difficult for me to be with these activities because of heavy homework and filled classes in the school's class blanks.
8.0	Undoubtly, it's necessary for me to get good scores to win the money to realize the dream that I could have the delicious food and get the latest comic books and novels.
5.0	Money for high grade has one more good advantage which is called hard-working habit.
8.0	As we all know, there is a example in many magazines about different characteristics between children in a criminal family and a teacher family.
8.0	The children in the criminal family always cheat and be accustomed to the money for what they did.
8.0	Nevertheless, children in the teacher family always compete for high grade for the prize parents offer.
8.0	I didn't mean that the behavior of this is the best way to teach children, but in my opinion, this method is a good way to teach children how to treat this prize of high grade in a proper way in the later society.
12.0	When it comes to the statement that it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise,some people hold that watching a movie or reading a book are the better choice.
11.0	But in my opinion,I do not agree with this idea.
5.0	First and foremost,exercise is good for health of body and mind.
8.0	Take me as an example,when I was nervous to review the university entrance exam,a simple exercise,such as walking for 20 minutes,would make my muscle relax,refresh my head and reduce my stress.
8.0	When  I walked alone,I would be concentrated on road and forget the troubles during the day.
8.0	In this way,can remove the stress and achieve the relaxation to face the test.
8.0	so I think doing some physcial exercise is a better choice than watching a movie or reading a book.
5.0	Moreover,through some exercises,such as playing basketball,we can communicate with others,which can provide a more efficient way to relax.
8.0	This communication makes us in the friendly atmosphere and good relaxed mood.
8.0	Especially when I make use of my own happy attitude to affect others and can make a good atmosphere.
8.0	If we give up the method to relax,our body will be bad.
8.0	For example,my best friend Bob,he just never does exercise.
8.0	He is fond of watching a movie and playing computer games.
8.0	Maybe watching a movie can make him relax,however,his body is overweight,as well as,very poor.
8.0	I am really worry about his health,and also beleib
2.0	All in all,Although watching a movie or reading a book is good way to relax,doing physical exercis is better to relax,as through it we could communicate with others and involved in the friendly atmosphere.
11.0	In my opinion,it does have active meanings for parents to choose to change their money for children's future.
5.0	"Why I support this""seem to push children more and more pressure""chioce is that,my experience during my high school life."
8.0	As everyone is dropped in this aggresive socity,once you fall behind,it will be a low possbility to go back and strech your pride,which I could have always been worried about this.
8.0	To prevant this terrible circumstance,I was sticking to asking my parents to provide money.
8.0	In addition,in China,part-time job has't become popluar since there are not so many jobs which are not anxious when thier employee haven't been graduated.
5.0	"Second,high grade or mark can be a ""bank"" sometimes."
9.0	You just throw more and more,and no one dislikes the smell of money in this strange world while you also can benifit from it.
9.0	The function of parents in the perspective of education is that improving children to be familair with all kinds of things they may meet in the future,you can be right when you get you high mark in your actively study,parents can use their salary to enjoy their right before thinking it worthwhile.
2.0	As confirmed as I know,high mark can easily change a child's opinin or his/her future,so why don't try to make it a chioce since you don't need to stand inside a church and just pray for god to help children on their own?
3.0	The argument is that group work is much more efficient than working alone.
11.0	It may seem reasonable at first glance, however , after a series of dubious holes under different circumstances, it is not founded steadily.
5.0	When working alone, one can wholy immersed in his own world, control the pace as it like, thus is often more likely to make a innovative achievement.
9.0	On contrast, if many people discuss at the same time, the atmosphere will be nervous or even anxious.
9.0	Moreover, if group memebers cannot reach an agreement, there probably will burst a row.
5.0	Only after full consideration can people join a discussion, or they may be lead by others, lost his own opinion, which is quite delestrious in people's growth and development.
8.0	As for me , one time I didn't search for full information and think deeply, the teacher start a group discussion, and I can only stand , silently.
8.0	There is no denying people's opinions varies, we may expand our horizons, while we don't have much knoledge storation.
8.0	then the content we discuss may not nuritrious at all, but more like a quarrel.
8.0	So why not use this time to catch more knowledge?
8.0	When we read thesis, isn't it also a way to discuss with former scholars with abundant experience, and highly improve our effectiveness instead we go further at a wrong road?
8.0	Many hard work need to be comlpleted at a quiet atmosphere, like many scientist who make great contributions to the human beings.
8.0	They are occupide in a small room alone, and finally get what they want.
8.0	If they listened to other's discouragements, then nothing will happen.
2.0	To sum up, I contends that working alone is more effective to our students.
12.0	Nowadays, due to the rapid development of society, the issue of what types of works people will work has become a controvercial topic.
11.0	Some believe they should do different work during workday, while others believe they should do the same tasks.
12.0	Although I have some doubts, I tend to adree with the former, and I will articulate my view below.
5.0	First, diverse work can keep persons' mind active.
8.0	Every time finishing one kind of task, the workers should change the way to resolve the work.
8.0	So, during the change, people have to use their brain to think what kind of solution they can adapt.
8.0	If so, it is more efficient for workers to cope with the diverse work.
8.0	for instance, a recent survice showed that about 85 persent of people who usually do diverse works can do more work than the persons who always do the same work in the same time.
5.0	Besides, it is work skills that different work can bring to individuals.
9.0	When individuals always change the task, they will adjust to this way.
9.0	And they will accumulate the experience that how to deal with the condition they ever did not confront, which can promote their work sk
2.0	Finally, indeed the same tasks is easier to do, people can not improve the career by this way.
10.0	old -- young
10.0	study new things
3.0	broaden their horizon: used to their own life == sturbbon == importnent to out of zone == see more and make good desicion promote relationship with fml: know pop thing child == child willing to talk == communicate with their pregenies effectively == ...
4.0	As the rapid development of technology, the generation gap bacomes increasingly broad as the youngsters absorb new things very quickly while the old are likely to resistent to accept new technology and new devices.
10.0	To narrow the generation gap down, the elderly are supposed to acquire new knowledge by themselves or with the help of their family members.
4.0	To start with, learning new stuffs enable the senior citizens to broaden their horizon and make right decisions concerning crucial issues.
8.0	To be specific, the old people are likely to be accustomed to their own lifestyle, since they are reluctant to change some outdated concepts in their mind which may lead them to make some mistakes.
8.0	In consequence, it is very important to help them step out of their comfort zone and open their eyes.
8.0	In this case, they are able to make right decisions with the aid of new knowledge they gain.
8.0	On the contrary, if they keep stubborn and unwilling to bring current ideas in their brains, they are possible to make blunders by sticking to some obsolete conceptions and ideas.
8.0	My grandfather is a excellent example.
8.0	Tracing back to my school age, I was shocked by my grandfather's bad attitude towards my mother.
8.0	Influenced by the traditional idea about patriarchy, my grandfather did not allow my mother to dress up nicely, talk aloud when having dinner, and contradict with my father.
8.0	However, as we suggest him to watch more TV program about progressive idea about equality and some modern concepts about family, he gradually changed his idea and even apologized to my mother for the previous mistreatment, which could not have happened before.
4.0	Besides, the older people can promote relationship with their family members more effectively since they are exposed to the current trends and popular culture that young people love.
8.0	To illustrate, most older people would find it hard to communicate with their children and grandchildren because of not knowing the popular objects the children like.
8.0	As a result, if the senior can learn what their children like and talk a lot about the cartoon they fall in love with, the children are willing to talk about not only the cartoon but also their school life and daily experience.
8.0	On the contrary, the young people don't have to worry about that because they do not have to face the generation gap.
8.0	For example, my cousin was always reluctant to link up whith his parents, which makes his parents upset and anxious.
8.0	Nevertheless, as they start to watch the television show that my cousin loved named Chinese Talent Show, they begined to coummunicate with their child a lot.
10.0	To sum up, the oder need to learn new things becasue they are facing more situation about generation.
3.0	Never before in the history has the problem of education been such salient today.
11.0	Since poeple treat education much more important, parents are likely to creat some new methodsto encourage their children to become more passionate about study.
12.0	Recently, yhe phenomenon that parents give money as a reward for getting high mark in school has caused wide public concern.
4.0	Some poeple indicate that it will change the opinion to children on study, making them believe only monney is the purpose of study.
10.0	However,I contend that giving some monney to children is a good choice that its merits weigh out its drawbacks.
4.0	to start with, giving money to the children as a reward can stimulate chilren to study harder.
8.0	When childen get feedback of their hard work, the study will become a happy job instead of just aboring duty..
8.0	We cannot refute that sometimes study is really boring, do a lot of exersise,listen to teacher carefully, do again and again.
8.0	In the way giving money to chilrden make they feel more passion in study and the feeling of get reward by making effort.
4.0	Another reason drives me to indicate is financial thinking as an important ablity which is useful to the modern poeple, meaning that we need to taech our kids the importance of money , how to earn mony and how to use money.
10.0	In this way,children will know the importance of money and only through their effort they can earn money.
1.0	Judging from what i have mentioned above is that i agree that parents should offer their school age students by giving money as areward to their high grade mark thety get in school.
1.0	However parents should make sure that children will not misunderstand the meaning of the reward and keep a healthy attitude to the m,onney
3.0	For the bike sharing scheme much more extensive in the Wuhan,  a majority of benifits and defects have already been appeared among in the change.
3.0	Whithin recent day, due to this project's showing up, many critizen have a curiosity and passion to ride the bike.
12.0	As time goes by, we will clearly find that many problem rise while a large number of benefits appear.
6.0	In the first place, the plan is appearing that the roade is not traffic jam than before.
8.0	Passengers can perfectly avoid the unpleasant traffic congestion and reduce the car to commute between wolkplace and home.
8.0	On one hand, it saves us time efficiently.
8.0	For example, I always spend 1 hour diriving car on the way, but nowadays I just cost 20 minutes.
8.0	On the other hand it'll make it easier for us to make plans and sche
3.0	In the comtemporary society , few issues have aroused more bitter cntroversy than the one of whether it is a beneficial metod that parents give their children pocket money for having good acadmic performance.
3.0	Some hold the idea that this will be harmful to childrens'development assert that it will make kid just study for money ,not for acquiring more knowledge.
11.0	It's partly true.
12.0	Nevertheless, I still believe that by offering money to good grades help children in one way or another.
4.0	First of all, offering money renders children to study in a renewed vigor.
9.0	Since their parents promise them that they will get extra money for high grade, they will study harder .
9.0	And when they earn the money through his or her hard work , he or she will feel more confident and get a feeling of accomplishment , which is a essential lesson for one's personal development.
4.0	Another reason I put special emphasis upon is children will learn to cope with his pr her own financial problem by having the award provided by their parents .
10.0	In fact , this is also a important ability for a person since managing your money well will give you a more balenced and happier life .
4.0	Admittedly , offering money for students because of their acadmic performance may render the student money-motivated,distorted ones'personal values or even make them only care about money .
9.0	However, by appropriately offering money to the children , this bad results will not happened or minimize the possibility.
9.0	Considering the merits that it will provide ,the highlight apparently outweigh its drawbacks.
2.0	In a nutshell, by rendering students to study in a renewed vigor and help them how to deal with personal finance problems,offering scool-age children for each high grade they get in school is beneficial to the children's development.
3.0	The problem whether it is easier for people to be educated well nowadays has provoked widely attention from the mass.
11.0	Some people believe that people are able to accept education much easilier than before, while others hold polar opposite view.
11.0	As far as I'm concerned, I will go for the former idea for several reasons.
4.0	First of all, the device and technology using for education are more advanced than before, which will facilitate our study to some extent.
8.0	There is no doubt that our society has witnessed unprecedented development for several decades.
8.0	At present, we can turn to high-tech devices, including the computer and smart phone, to study everywhere.
8.0	For instance, with the aid of Iphone, I can listen to Eglish record even on the flight, which seems impossible even 20 years ago.
8.0	In addition, the advanced transportation system and prosperous economy offer us presious chance to study abroad.
8.0	On the contrary, study might be a more complex issue for the people in the past.
8.0	They could never turn to any information online when they were confused with a problem on the study material, nor could they sent massege to the teacher whenever they need any help and instruction.
8.0	Therefore, the developed world provides people with superior method to approach the summit of knowledge today.
4.0	Moreover, the position about the knowledge and education will encourage more people to be knowledgeable.
8.0	As is known to all, the development of human being is not only reflect from the ttechnology or economy condition, nut also from the transformation of perspective on the world.
8.0	Nowadays, people are enlightened by the theory of educators.
8.0	They believe that the world will just be changed by the power of knowledge; thereofer, mre parents start to put more money and energy on their children's education.
8.0	They will drive them to participate in more after-class study group, or plan to encourage them to be international students even when they are young, which are common phenomena especailly in some developing counrty.
8.0	According to a research conducted by MIT, over half of parents in China write sending their kids to study abroad in their schedule list.
8.0	Under this cercumtances, people now are received high quality education than in the past actually.
4.0	Admittedly, they are more things especailly some entertainment facilities are devices may interfere students's study now.
10.0	However, their parents and school are starting to make srtict rule on them; thereofer, they will avert the influence from them effectively in the future, and they still receive efficient education today.
1.0	Take into account all the factors mentioned above, we can arrive at the conclusion easily that people today will be well-education easily.
1.0	Not only because the help of the technology, but also the view on the education itself ecouraging more people to learn more valuable things.
3.0	Recently, an issus has aroused a wide range of debates: whether teachers should be paid as much as doctors , lawyers or business leaders are paid.
3.0	Some argue that there is no need for the government to pay so much for teachers, while I think teachers deserve a salary in the lever equal to doctors or other high paid occupations.
11.0	My opinion is supported by following reasons.
6.0	Teachers can devote more time and energy to teaching children if they have such high salary, which is benefit to children and in long term, the whole country.
8.0	In recent years, teachers in China live on a low salary which is not enough for them to lead a comfortable life.
8.0	Most of them have to worry about family budjet, so their energy and time are consumed by those mundane rather than concentrate on teaching, which means the students in their class maynot get enough guidance and their problems in study cannot be solved in time.
8.0	As a result, their   performance in study will get worse and worse.
8.0	Imgine if most students face the same situatrtion, the country's education quality is insuffient to cultivate talented people.
8.0	My little brother studied in a primary school when he was at grade 1.
8.0	In the middle of the semester, my father found him not perform well in math although what he learnt is not difficult.
8.0	Then my father found that the math teacher teach some nessasary skills in cram school to a smller scale of chidren whose parents pay extra money for him, for his salary is just 2000 RMB a month, which is evrn not enough to pay for the house debt.
8.0	So he was busy finding other way to make money although the expense was the future of many kids.
10.0	Teachers
12.0	There is no doubt that extended family played a vital role in people's daily lives but now whether the importance of them is lower now is controversial.
11.0	In my opinion, now they are less siginficant than before.
4.0	First of all, now poeple have less time to get on with extended family.
8.0	As nowadays people is busier than before, people always work and live in different cities and sometimes only in some crucial festivals will they go back to their homeland and meet their extend family, by which they have fewer chances to stay with the extend family.
8.0	For instance, my friend was working in Wuhan but all his relatives living in Shenzhen which is far from his city.
8.0	Because of this, it was hard for him to come back to see his relatives and hardly stay with them, as a result, he just had normal relationship with his relatives.
4.0	Second, the relationship of friends and working partners now become more and more significant making up much of one's life.
8.0	As now every people has their own friends and collegues and many time are used to keep good relationship with those people who can help them in time and play or work with them, which means it will be less time for people to stay with relatives and their importance undoubtfully declines.
8.0	to illustrate, I am now working in different city from most of my extended family.
8.0	I have to spend lots of time to get on with my colleagus and frineds and because of this I really have a little time to spend on my extended family.
8.0	Besides they cannot accompany me but those friends or working partners sttling in the same city as me and they are more crucial for me than those relatives.
4.0	On the other hand, though extend family indeed has some virtues, it is not unplaced now.
8.0	Grandparents have abundant experience, by which they can give us some practical suggestions to help people.
8.0	Cousins are at the same age as people so they can exchange their experience and problems, whcih means they can find another person can well understand them.
8.0	To be sure they are still playing a role in people's life, but undoubtfully they now are less important.
2.0	All in all, for all these reasons, it is obviously that extended family now is less important than they used to be in the past.
11.0	I think parents offer their school-age children money for each high garde they get in school is a good ider.
12.0	There is no doubt children can be inspired in study in this activity.
11.0	Parents give their children money when they get high mark can help them be concerned about their study.
5.0	At first,I think give money to their children when they get great job in school can encourage them.
8.0	For example,when I was studied in high school,I'm not that good at my math.
8.0	My parents want me improve my mark in exam,so they told me if I can get high mark in next exam at school, they'd loved to give me more money for it.
8.0	That was very inspired me a lot .
8.0	It turns my attitude for my math class.
8.0	After then,I get really hard work on  my math study,finally,I got a high mark and money.
5.0	And then,I think offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school is a good way in education.
8.0	When children get high grade and money,they wuold be very exciting and pleasure on it.
8.0	But if they get mark which is not that good enough to get their parent's offer,they would be considering about those days when they study at school,what's wrong with their lessons.
8.0	They realized the what's the problem is ,and next time they could be better in exam.
2.0	Any way,parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school is a good idea for me.
3.0	Recently, a topic has aroused a heated debate: is maintaining friendship with a small group of people more important and makes you more happy than making new friends easily?
3.0	Some people think that it is more important to make new friends easily, and they feel happy when they make new friends.
12.0	However, I definitely insist that maintaining friendship with a small group of people is of greater significance, and will make me much happier.
5.0	To begin with, the friends that make easily usually cannot help us when we are facing difficulties.
8.0	With the rapid development of the society, the intention for poeple to make friends become more lucrative than in the past.
8.0	"Most people want to make friends with someone only because he or she has some specific points that can benefit them, so they use some means to please the person, and they become ""friends""."
8.0	"They are good friends when they can make profits on each other, however, when they meet some difficulties or big problems, their ""friends"" get away from them, even no longer contact them."
8.0	On the contrary, a group of people who we always maintain friendship with them, are usually willing to help us when we meet difficulties, because we became friend because we can get real friendship and happiness from them rather than something like money or power.
8.0	"Just as the saying goes, ""A friend in need is a friend indeed"", they will contribute themselves to help us because we are real friends and trust worthy."
5.0	Moreover, we usually do not need many people understand us well, but a group of people that know about our feelings and what we really want.
9.0	We usually meet some problems in our life, and we usually feel not happy, and we usually get the problems solved when we talk to a small group of friends and they help us.
9.0	They
3.0	At present, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people: whether government should hire more police or renovate the old buildings and streets in order to attract tourist.
3.0	Some claim that government should hire more police or renovate the old bulidings and streets since tourist will feel secure and fresh.
3.0	However contrary to their view comes my perspective that hire more police cannot fundamentally eliminate the crime and old buildings are the most precious treasure of a country.
11.0	My point can be elaborated as follows.
6.0	To begin with, hire more police is inefficient.
8.0	To be more specific, if government hire more police, it will cost a lot of money and time to train them.
8.0	Even though after training, they still need to accumulate experience in their career.
8.0	So at the first three or four years, government just spend a lot of money but improve limited safty.
8.0	What' s more, more police cannot destroy people's criminal motivation.
8.0	For instance, a man have no job, family and even no food to eat.
8.0	In order to live on, he might aroused the idea of robbery and never care about there will be how many police to catch him.
8.0	As far as i am concerned, government should spend their money on improving education and citizens' life levels.
8.0	If all of the citizens  are high-educated and have a better life, then  none of them will be force to be a criminal.
2.0	To be followed, it is old building and streets that attract tourist to visit.
7.0	People always like the old things such as
3.0	Just as the idiom goes, every coin has two sides.
3.0	As the development of the society and improvement of people's daily lives, people are facing far more severe environment problems than before, such as massive deforestation, over usage of plastic appliances, and air pollution.
11.0	In consequence, the authorities should take actions to reverse the situation.
11.0	As to the reduction of air pollution, In my opinion, raising the cost of fuel is not the best method.
4.0	First of all, strict policy to restrain the output of pollutant is a far better option.
8.0	To be specific, one of the biggest factors of the serious air pollution at present is the large amount of waste gas expelled by the factory.
8.0	As a result, the government should cut out the main source of the pollution by forcing strict policy that restrain the amount of output of pollutant.
8.0	In this way, as less toxic gas is released to the open air, the air pollution would be reduced effectively.
8.0	For example, Beijing, the capital of China, was notorious for this bad air quality about ten years ago.
8.0	At that time, the sky looked grey and people can hardly recognize each other within five meters in the street because of the dense haze caused by the air pollution.
8.0	However, as the government passed the law to reduce the released gas, such as sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide, in the adjacent regions, the sky gradually turned blue and clear, and the residents no longer need a mask to protect themselves from the haze and air pollution.
4.0	Besides, the authorities should encourage people and administrations to plant more trees and recover the forests to combat with the air pollution.
8.0	To illustrate, trees are able to inhale carbon dioxide, dust, and other toxic gas, which may leads to many severe dieases.
8.0	Furthermore, trees release oxygen, which can refresh the air and make people feel more comfortable.
8.0	For instance, there were massive construction around my community, which resulted in severe air pollution because of the quantaties of dust and particle that generated in the process of construciton.
8.0	To improve the air quality in the neighborhood, almost every member of the community participate in the planting activities, which brought about huge increase in the rate of vegetaion converage, allowing the air quality became as fresh as usual.
4.0	Admiittedly, raising the cost of fuel may lead to some positive impact on the air quality, however, it would bring about people's complain, since people have to pay extra money on the gasonline.
10.0	As a consequence, they may feel annoying about enviromental protection, which would cause further obstacle in the future.
2.0	To sum up, apart from rasing the cost of fuel, both strict policy and planting more trees are more effective methods to reduce air pollution.
12.0	I think people will spend less time on cooking and preparaing foods in twenty years than they do today.
6.0	Twenty years later, we may have more automatic cooking machine in our home to help cook meal or even handle all the chorses of cooking.
8.0	With the constantly developement of technology, more and more machine that help us save time will be invented in the future,like machines that can frise the potatos, making sandwichs or cook a pice of beef and so on.
8.0	The only cost of time for us is to put those ingredience into those machines, then we go to do other things and wait for a meal.
8.0	Moreover, there may be a robot, that handle cooking the whole meal.
8.0	With so much convinience, it is not likely that we will spend more time on cooking.
8.0	Now in my home, I have already used the oven to help cook, wether I want to roast a potato or heat some pieces of bread, I just need to put them into the oven, and after several minites, the meal is ready.
8.0	That's just a considerable saving of my time.
8.0	And I can hardly imagine that 20 years later, how convinient it will be to use updated machine help cooking.
2.0	There will be more 24-hours conviniece store in twenty years, which will provide quick meal for us.
8.0	The last couple of years have seen thousands of conviniece store's appearance in the cities' streets.
8.0	And people who are struggling to adjust to fast-pace life show a tendency to buy a meal rather than cook it by themselves.
8.0	As a result, people will use less time to cook.
8.0	As a engineering student with more than 5 subjects to study every semester, I hardly have time to cook.
8.0	Usually I'll buy a brief meal from the canteen or those 24-hours convinience stores near the place where I study in.
3.0	The significance of many different types of tasks can never be overemphasized because it is closely related to obtain more experience.
3.0	When it come to the issue whether workers are more satisfied when they have many different types of tasks to do during the workday than when they do similar tasks all day long, some people disagree this idea.
3.0	In my opinion, I agree with this topic that workers are more satisfied when they have many different kinds of works to do during the everyday without weekend than when they do similar works all day long.
12.0	I am going to elaborate this passage paragraphs.
6.0	People can learn kinds of experience from those tasks for their future's development.
8.0	People accumulate many methods when they meet the trouble.
8.0	They can prevent second's mistakes and overcome it.
8.0	Let them become more strong during people met same problem, and they can become more claim to treat.
8.0	However, workers do similar tasks all day long,they will feel boring and no interesting to do it.
8.0	My sister do many volunteers' works such as help teacherto teach child some simple things, take care of old people and give them some fund during summer vacation.
8.0	She cannot feel boring, whereas she feel interesting and would love to help helpless's people.
8.0	She can bring mental and material's things for them.
8.0	She talk with those people and use action to help through her insist.
8.0	She can feel happy.
8.0	We can learn more acpects for our future development.
0.0	People can have more change to find themselves favorate's work what it is.
0.0	They can have more space to fing their favorate things what they is good at.
0.0	However, people only do similar tasks all day long.
8.0	Firstly, they will feel boring.
8.0	Secondly, they also find other works to adjust when they lost this works because they cannot finish this very well.
8.0	This is very difficult.
8.0	Therefore, we should find ourselves works what we adjust.
8.0	My mother choose many professional jobs.
7.0	Because she
11.0	I don't agree with the idea of saying it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relaxing by doing physical exercise.
4.0	First of all, while we are watching a movie or reading a book, we are still getting information, actually, our brains are still working.
9.0	Because we need to follow the develop of the story, thinking about what was going on, remember the relationship between characters, that may make us more tired instead of making us more relax.
9.0	And, when we are doing physical exercise, we don't have to use our brain, we are just doing some body moves, which could give us more relax on our brain.
4.0	Then, doing physical exercise could make our bodies healthier.
10.0	When we are doing physical exercise, we are exercising the muscles of our body, and help with our circulatory system, if we just lay there and watching a movie or reading a book, our whole body function will slow down, and most people want to eat while they are watching a movie, also most of the food they eat during a movie are not that healthy, mostly are sweets and junk food, and people could easily gain weight.
4.0	At last, doing exercise could also help get more close with friends or make more friends.
8.0	When we want to relax by exercising, we can go hiking with some of our friends, and while we are hiking, we can chat with each other, bring everybody closer.
8.0	On our way, we will meet lots of people maybe are hiking or walking their dogs as well, it would be nice to communicate with them and make friends with them.
8.0	Even when we go to a gym, there usually lots of people in the gym, we can also make friends through that way.
8.0	But watching a movie and reading a book need quiet environment.
8.0	Even we watch a movie with friends, we barely have a chance to talk with each other during the movie, which gained less communication than going on a hiking or doing some other exercise with friends.
2.0	Above all, I don't agree that relax by watching a movie or reading a book is better that relaxing by doing physical exercise.
3.0	With the fast-changing development of world and society, there exist numerous events happened everyday, especially social and political events.
3.0	As teachers are people who communicate with and guide students every single day, it is obvious that their opinions are crucial for students.
3.0	Therefore, some people believe that teachers are supposed to let their students know their social or political views.
11.0	However, I do not agree with this statement, for this kind of behavior is certainly affects the quality of teaching and misleads students.
5.0	In the first place, making their opinions about society and politics known by students is going to lead to a decrease of teaching quality.
8.0	The main job for teachers is to help kids familiar with knowledge they are supposed to learn instead of useless social and political opinions.
8.0	For example, my math teacher in high school was capable of teaching but had a habit of speeching in front of us and telling us his opinion about current social or political views, which totally did  harm to our study.
8.0	In spite of the fact that he made a lot fun for us, we were sick of him talking constantly about his boring and rigid opinoins.
5.0	In addition to that, it is likely that the views of teachers of social and political events are going to misguide students.
9.0	Since students in high school or university are still in the process of observing and thinking rules and principles of the world, they are probably willing to take their teachers' views as references even rules, which is inclined to make some tragdies.
9.0	It is reported that a student in a college in Beijing learned a dramatically radical political opinion from his history professor, which resulted in that this student came up with untolerent opinion about one serious current event and got himself in prison eventually.
2.0	To put it into a nutshell, teachers are suppose to foucs on their major job instead of making their social or political views known to students, because students are too young to learn the right opinion.
3.0	All of the children's parents want their children get a high grades in school,because it will prove their son is better than others.
12.0	When their son get a high grade in school,some parents will give some money to their children for reward.
11.0	I dont think it is a good idea that some parents offer thier school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.
11.0	Although some children will study hard than before to get more reward.
11.0	But it will make some children to get more reward to use some bad way to get a high mark.
8.0	So it not only cause the good children get bad,but also the children will learn to use shortcut to get success.
8.0	If their parents don't konw this thing,and it will destory a child.
8.0	And when their parents find that thing,it will be so later to stop that,Because their child isn't that good child who they known.
5.0	The other reason is the school-age children is too small,it is a suitable age to have much money.
8.0	Some children will take the money to school,and other children who their parents don't give money to them will produce jealousy noone will know they will do what things.
8.0	It will cause bad effect to children.
8.0	So parents may be use some others smaller and cheaper reward instead of money.
8.0	And it will also prove their parents care about them grades,and the children also will study hard,but not get bad.
5.0	And the most important thing is that school-age children is not safty to take much money on them body.
8.0	Because it will not to portend what things will be happened.
8.0	If the children with more money met crime.
8.0	it would be very dangerous.
8.0	Their parents also don't want to see this.
2.0	In a word,it is not a good idea to give money to school-age children for reward.
3.0	Many school-aged children get money from their parents because they get good grades, or some other reasons.
12.0	Their parents might think that their children can do well next time because they wil recieve the award if they do so.
11.0	In my opinion, I think it is a good way to inspire the children continued to work hard.
4.0	Firstly,children always need their parents and their teachers to encourage them to keep trying hard.
9.0	Sometimes they might be lazy and it is also possible for them to give up after a few failures.
9.0	But if they are told that if they try vey hard and they finally success to finish their work, they can get some present, they might feel they are encouraged.
4.0	Secondly, giving young children some money for themselves to manage is a benifical way to let them know how to spend money and save money.
8.0	Some children mignt spend all the money as soon as they got it, while others save some part of the money.
8.0	The children which don't save money at all may finally realize that if next there is a toy they want to have, they won't have any cent left to buy it.
8.0	Than they will learn that they should save some parts of their money in case they will use it in the future.
4.0	"Finally, if a child can always past the tests with fly colos but his parents never said""good job"" or show to their child that he did a good job, than the child may feel very sad because he did well but his parents didn't seem to appricieate it at all."
8.0	That may cause the child not to trying hard at all.
8.0	The child is young and he always needs others, especially his parents to encourage them.
8.0	When they did a good job they apprcieate him and whe  he didn't do well, his parents encourage him in time.
2.0	All in all, school-aged childre can be awarded by their parents with some m oney.
3.0	The subject, history, was always argued by the professor on whether we should learn it in the university.
11.0	And I believe you always see people learn the history to avoid making the same mistakes which were made in the past.
12.0	Besides, as we all know, one subject always has its own special history, which the students learning the subject will benefit a lot from it.
5.0	First, we can see this fact that people always made the same mistakes as our ancestors has made.
8.0	"For example, the first American president, Washington had a quotation, which went like this, ""histroy was a significant tool to prevent us from making stupid mistakes""."
8.0	And he also uesd his own experience to prove this.
8.0	When the UK was defeated by the army of US.
8.0	Washington was the person who took the power.
8.0	Surely, he could choose to be a king, and make this country ruled by him.
8.0	But he didn't, he chose to give this power back to the public, and establish the Congress of America to limit the power of persident.
8.0	He learnt this from the history of the empire which went disappearance.
5.0	Secondary, just like I say, each subject has its own and soecial history.
8.0	Take Newton for an instance, we all know that Newton was one of the greatest scientists ever.
8.0	"But what he said was this ""I can achieve so much just because I stand on the shoulder of the giant""."
8.0	And the giant refered to some other great scientists like Decar.
8.0	Newton got his spiration from what these scientists' research.
8.0	He learnt the method which is much more efficent when doing some research from these scientists' history.
8.0	How the found those flumas?
8.0	All of this gave Newton great spiration.
8.0	And this was how Newton benefited from history.
0.0	Lastly, some people may argue that if it takes much time to learn the history, the students will not have enough effotr to focus on their profession, which can do great harn to their grades.
0.0	On the countrary, I think learning history can help students to manage their own time more efficently.
0.0	They can exactly know how much time they should spend on studying history and how much time they should spend on their profession.
0.0	And this ability can make them to make full use of their own time, which will plays an important when they graduate from the university.
11.0	I disagree with this opinion.
11.0	I think friends can influence us more in our daily life.
12.0	Because students meet friends in most of the time instead of any indivusual teacher, and students also like to talk or play with friends more.
5.0	Although teachers experience more than students and usually more knowlegeable to students, which should be very useful for students, students would still influenced by their friends more.
8.0	Because in most of the cases, teacher don't know the most true opinion of students, that makes some communications become difficult.
8.0	In other words, students are not willing to talk to teachers.
8.0	Also, teachers don't have much time to influence students other than teach knowledge.
8.0	Of course, teachers would infulence students, jut not too much.
5.0	The first reason that friends can influence students more instead of teacher is that students will have more time to communicate with friends, and it could be 24 hours a day for some closer friends.
8.0	Because the time is longer, friends will know about each other.
8.0	In my class, there is a girl who is very shy and thre is another one who is outgoing.
8.0	After they became friends, they do everything together including having lunch and after school time.
8.0	After months, the shy girl became more outgoing and not afraid to talk to people and present in public.
8.0	I think that is because of her outgoing friend.
0.0	Lastly, people in the same age will be more understanding for each other.
0.0	Everyone should know that who people mostly like to talk with when they have something special to say.
0.0	That probably will not be teacher and parent because people afraid that last generations would misunderstand them.
0.0	People would like to tell friends about serets because they will understand, if it is a problem, they can even help to work it out.
0.0	Also, students will do what their friends do for the same reason.
3.0	I disagree with the statement that it is more enjoyable to have a job where you work only three days a week for long hours than to have a job where you work five days a week for shorter hours.
11.0	These are my reasons.
4.0	First, if you work three days a week, the the amount of work will be more than before, because the total amount of work is never go up and down.
8.0	So you wouldn't have enough time to sleep in these three days, so you wouldn't work in these three days so efficiently, so the working time is longer.
8.0	You can see, this strategy will make you into a vicious circle.
8.0	But the second strategy would not have this problem.
8.0	So I prefer this strategy.
4.0	Second, although the second strategy will let you work for another two days, but the total amount of work is never go up and down, so you can work for less amount easily every day.
10.0	For example, the teachers in the school would like the second strateg,y, because if teachers have 1 class everyday for 5 days, they will have time to do their things, but if they work for 3 days, they could not say any word.
4.0	Third, if you have rest for 4 days, you would play games, go out for visting or having fun, and then you couldn not adjust the state of you so quickly, so you could not work so efficiently.
10.0	But if you choose the second strategy, you wouldn't have this kind of problems.
2.0	So, that's why I prefer to the second strategy.
12.0	Recently, a topic has aroused a heated debate among people: whether students should be given more of time to do what they want.
11.0	Attittudes  vary from person to person.
11.0	Some people believe that their children should be allowed to do more what they want.
12.0	However as far as I am concerned, children nowadays should spend more time on doing the assignments or taking part in  several activites related to school or sports.
11.0	My perspectives can be elaborated as follows.
5.0	Firstly, do things related to school can help children get a promising futue.
8.0	This is because only a student has finished all the tasks in the school, will he have a good grade and during the time of school.
8.0	The grade is the most important thing of a student.
8.0	Nowadays many employers pay a great attention on the students' grade.
8.0	So with the help of a good grade he can achieve a higher position in the society.
8.0	For example, My frined Li spends nearly fifteen hours in lab everyday to do his research and never spend time on his hobbies.
8.0	However finally his research comes to be big success, a lot of big companys then come to him and give him opportunity to work.
8.0	Needless to say spending time on things related to school is benefial to his future carrer in my roomate's example.
5.0	Furthermore, doing things related to school can improve student's ability of self-denpendence.
8.0	This is because most things related to school require students to finish the assignment or investigate something by himslef.
8.0	In this process, students should try their best to find the answer to the questions by their own effort.
8.0	Then their ability of self-denpendace may be built.
8.0	However if we give more time to students to do what they want, most of them might just waste that time and do noting.
8.0	For example, teacher in my primary school always asked Taking what has been discussed into account, it is wiser for students spend more time to do things related to school, not only because it is helpful to their future, but also they can develop their ability of dealing with problems alone.
3.0	Advertisements have been breaking old norms and generating new trends in North America.
3.0	In present-day society, it seems the consumption of goods and services is more spurred by advertising power.
11.0	Take the phenomenon into consideration, individuals are supposed to evaluate the reason that brings about it.
11.0	And there is not exaggerate to make the conclusion that most advertisements enable products to seem more appealing than they really are.
5.0	First of all, many entrepreneurs utilize the customers' comsumption that most of them prefer to judge whether they will purchase the product from some advertisements on the media to create many inauthentic but attractive advertisements .
8.0	For instance, many housewives always watch soap opera at home everyone.
8.0	When the soap is over, many advertisements are ocurring, for the sake of their exquisite packaging, these women are willing to buy these products.
8.0	However, these products actually do not good when they eventually pick them up.
8.0	Nevertheless, these women will forget the disadvantages of the products and introduce its benefits to their friends, so many companies even multinational corporation will inventionlly make the advertisement better to attract someone who do not care the quality.
5.0	On top of that, making the advertisements seem better than they really, resulting in many surpring favorable influence.
9.0	To illustrate, thousands of newpapers and magazines and dozens of radio and television all resouns with differing aspects of the products.
9.0	Thereby, a hugem number of people extremely rely on these media, so if the coporation could make the advertisements seems pretty fine even that is better than the real products, they will gain more cumstomers and profits.
2.0	Admittedly, it is true that if these advertisements are false or unrealistic, bring about a negative influnce on the society.
7.0	However, with the development of our life, more people prefer to enjoy the visison
3.0	Nowadays, some parents are used to offer their school-age children money for each high grade or mark they get in school.
3.0	Some children even ask their parents to do so.
3.0	The higher grade or mark they get, the more money they can get.
11.0	In fact, in my opinion, this is truly a bad behavior, both to the parents and to their children.
12.0	Now it's time to stop it!
5.0	First, this can easily lead to cheat during the exams.
8.0	If the children know that grade is equalle to money, they will sure try their best do get a high mark.
8.0	That is OK because still they are trying to get repaid by their own efforts.
8.0	But when the exam is really difficult, what will they do?
8.0	If they know that everybody feels that it's too difficult, still nothing will happen.
8.0	The problem is that during the exam they don't know how other students feel.
8.0	They will only get stressed out as they think money is away this time.
8.0	So if you were a student, what would you do?
8.0	To be honest without money, or try to cheat to get the money?
8.0	As a kid, most of them don't eactly know what's correct and what's wrong.
8.0	Then how can you expect that they won't cheat?
5.0	Second, it's not doing anything good to anybody.
8.0	If parents pay for the grade their kids get, the kids will sure think that they're study for their parents or anybody else except for themselves.
8.0	That's bad for their development.
8.0	They will always think that they are forced to do these things.
8.0	If they can't realize that study is their own things, they will never be pleased to learn.
8.0	When parents can not be with them or can not pay them enough money, for sure they won't study anything.
8.0	When these kids become adults, how you can expect them to be scientist?
8.0	If there is no scientists in our society, how can the society develop?
0.0	So it's time to stop this.
0.0	If your children ask you to do so, you should let them know it's not correct.
0.0	We are adults and we should do something to make our society better.
3.0	As we all know,some parents off their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.
11.0	However, I consider that this is not beneficial to students .
11.0	What's more, I will give some examples to support my point.
4.0	Firstly,school-age children will lose their purity.
8.0	To illustrate, when my cousin was  kid ,his parents said if you get high grade , we will give you some money.
8.0	So, my cousin became very realistic when he did everything .
8.0	He always think about money when others ask him do others' a favor .
4.0	Secondly,this will make school-age children do everything with all kinds of methods , including bad ways and good ways .
9.0	For instance , in my milddle school,one of my classmate wanted to satisfy her own vain and praise from others .
9.0	So she cheated when she was testing .
4.0	Additionly, this may make they don't want to study earily .
10.0	Like one of my friends , she who ever gained the thoughts went to work so much early so that she could not study well and learn so much knowledge.
10.0	In brief ,I hpoe every
11.0	According to this question, in my opinion, i deeply agree that its better to relax by watching a movie.
11.0	There are some reasons.
11.0	First of all, watching a movie means you don't need to make yourself feel tired in any scales.
11.0	As we know, to take physical exercise would make your body feel tired.
12.0	Of course,not easy.
12.0	Secondly, there is no time limited watching a movie,what means you can have a movie after work, shawer.
8.0	And you can pause the movie as you like.
8.0	But the physical exercise, must be taken fluently and can't be paused,or it would be useless,and an exercise should be taken in the morning cause of the weather is the best in the day .
8.0	Thirdly,there are many types of the movies, and you can choose the way you like to relax and take a rest.
8.0	But the exercise, there is only one way:run.
8.0	Its very borning, isn't?
5.0	As for reading books,is also a free way and doesn't need any requirements.
8.0	And reading can develop a man's horizons, make a person more knowledgable,waht exercise can't do.
8.0	Not only watching a movie, but also reading has many kinds  to choose.
8.0	From many countries, there are many famous writers.
8.0	Reading can make you more confidence,more congerous.
5.0	For me, I also perfer watching a movie and reading a book to relax.
9.0	A man often needs sometimes to stay with himself.
9.0	And this two ways are quite enough to be alone.
2.0	So,it can be seen clearly that watching a movie or reading a book ti relax are better than doing physical exercises.
12.0	In universities, taking some curriculum is mandatory for students, and some people claim that studying history courses should be also required for all the students.
11.0	However, as far as I am concerned, this proposal is not reasonable.
12.0	My reasons and examples are listed as follows.
5.0	First and foremost, taking extra history courses will increase students' burden.
8.0	Today, students in colleges need to deal with a large quantity of tasks in their own majors.
8.0	If they are enforced to take history courses at the same time, they may lose the chance to relax and feel stressed out.
8.0	My own experience can be a salient example for this point.
8.0	I am a student majoring in biology.
8.0	In my daily lives, what I have to complete are lots of assingments from various subjects and experiments in my laboratory.
8.0	Only after my work every evening can I obtain the opportunity to listen to my favorite music or chat with my friends to relieve my pressure.
8.0	If I was also required to handle the content in my history courses, it would deprive my last chance to rest and relax.
5.0	What's more, compelling students to study the subject that is not relevant to theri major is unfair for them.
8.0	That is because except our professional courses, we are supposed to have the right to choose what we want to learn according to our own interest.
8.0	I have a case to aptly illustrate my point.
8.0	I major in biology, while in my spare time, I prefer to learn some instrument in the student recreation center.
8.0	Those elegant melodies enable me to refresh my mind and I can also share my feeling about music with my friends,which is enjoyable and meaningful for me.
8.0	Thus, I do not want school to ask me spend my time to learn that I am not Interested in.
10.0	I
11.0	As we know, the school is a place that we can have access to the knowledge and experience of our life.
12.0	And one of the most effective way to weight our work in the school is the grade, coming from every time of tests.
3.0	So paents always hope us get a higt grade in the school, and it is no doubt that the phonemenon that some parents offer their children money for each hight grade they get in the school has become a debatable issue.
3.0	And what is you opinion?
9.0	For me, it is a good idea.
9.0	The reasons are as follows.
6.0	First, it is a great reward for students to get some money from parents due to their high mark.
8.0	Because we had paid a huge amount of efforts when we make progress in our academic.
8.0	And some finacial reward will stimulate the student to tet them better,and meanwhile, they will feel that their effort is worthwhile.
8.0	For example, when I was a child, I always did a bad job in math and once I wanted to change it.
8.0	I spent a month to strengthen my ability in math and finally, I got an A in next test.
8.0	My parents were so proud of me and they paid the check of my new bike.
8.0	After that, I stepped into the right path of study.
10.0	Sceond.
3.0	A conterversial topic has aroused heated debated: Whether government should promote the safety by hiring more police or improving the appearance by refreshing and maintaining old buildings and streets.
3.0	Opinions vary from people to people.
3.0	Some people claim that hiring more police can guarantee visitors safety and their valuable objects, since it is more frequent to be stloen when visiting the landscapes.
3.0	However, I hold an opposite view that government ought to promote the old buildings and streets, because the protecting the old buildings and streets is the essential to the ensure the thriving of local visitorism.
5.0	First, improving the old building and streets can increase the diversity of sites.
8.0	Since, currrently, lots of the old building and streets are experiencing severely demaged and even destroyed by the process of weather, irresponsible doodle and destrunction for factory land.
8.0	Thanks to lack of awareness of improving and protecting the old building and streets, the number of them is rapidly decreasing.
8.0	In this case, it is imperative to improving the old buildings and streets, which can provide visitors more places where they can appreciate the ancient wisdom,  contact local history and inspire their talents.
8.0	There is no doubt that after such enjoyable exprience, visitors will spread out the old building and streets and more and more people will come to visit the old building.
8.0	For instance, my hometown drafted, passed and enforced a series of regulations to improve the old building and streets, which ensured them to be destructed and replaced and refresh their appearence.
8.0	The new appearence left a great impression on visitors.
8.0	After they come back, they introduce my hometown to their friends and encourage them to visit and enjoy the beauty of my hometown.
5.0	Second, improving the old buildings and streets can improve the local environment.
8.0	Since, the old building and streets are usually dirty and full of litter.
8.0	This is because, their old appearance gives people an illusion that they have be already so dirty, so there is no necessart to protect the environment.
8.0	When the visitors come here and see litter all around the city.
8.0	It definitely will leace a bad impression on the visitors.
8.0	So how can they popularize the the local landscape?
7.0	To put it in a nutshell, the importance of improving the appearance by improving the stree
11.0	I hold the opinion  that if workers can have lots types of tasks to do rather than doing the repetitive work all day long , they  will be more satisfied with their job.
4.0	A great advantage of doing different tasks is that those workers would not feel tedious.
8.0	Because they will constantly face different situations, they have to adapt to them therefore it helps to develop their potential.
8.0	Thus the challenging and highly demanding job can let the employees feel interseting.
8.0	With this kind of circumstance, they will work hard to improve their abilities.
4.0	On the contrary, what will happen if workers work all day long with the same task?
9.0	They certainly have alreadly mastered that repetitive job,so they do not need to think or creat.
9.0	This work pattern seems like robots and i do not think that  any workers are willing to do this kind of jobs in the long run because anyone can simply replace him or her, they cannnot learn any thing in a position in which are full of boring single tasks.
4.0	Here is a example. a friend of mine owns a factory which producing tools.
9.0	In the first, in order to improve the efficiency, he assigned  just one task to his workers.
9.0	However, after several months, he received a lot of complaints from his employees who all think their jobs deter their chances of learning other knowledge and improving their abilities.
4.0	Later, my friend reduce the total workload and assigned more tyoes of tasks to each workers, in this way, those workers feel like they are being the improtant part of the company and they have shouldered  more and more responsibility.
10.0	They are also delighted that they can have a bigger platform to cultivate and show their abilities.
0.0	In summary, i totally agree with the idea of giving workers more types of tasks to do.
0.0	By doing this, those workers would have more chances to develop themselves.
0.0	Thus they will be more satisfied with their jobs.
3.0	People always travel either in their native country or on abroad.
3.0	I believe that you always have seen the lack of a tour guide in other country because the blooming of tourism.
11.0	Besides, you can also see the people who have been to other country knows more than others.
12.0	How this happen?
12.0	Is it just because that people think travel to other country can offer them more fun?
11.0	I don't think so.
9.0	The reason can be like this.
9.0	People will benefit more when they travel to foreign countries.
5.0	First, this traveling experience can provide them with a great view of some new thing, and this can open their eyes.
8.0	For example, as we all know, Ma yun didn't creat his company called Alibaba until he has travelled to America.
8.0	Because of what he has seen in Sicolon Valley,  he found the potenial of Internet.
8.0	And he thought the Internet will finally change people 's lifestyle and improve the world.
8.0	I don't think he can just came up with this great idea if he didn't travel to the US.
8.0	It's the travelling experience that played an important role in his creation of the Alibaba.
5.0	Secondary, by travelling to foreign country, we will experience different cultures since people in different countries have distinct ways of living.
8.0	And then, we can learn some advantages from them.
8.0	Take Japan for example, Japan has been invaded by some western countries.
8.0	And people in Japan wanted to truly know why the western countries were stronger than Japan.
8.0	Then, they realuzed that the mechanism that western uesd to ru their country is more effcicent.
8.0	And the culture there are more scientic than theirs.
8.0	So they decided to learn form these countruies.
8.0	Now you can still find many common points in the culture of western countries and Japan.
8.0	And that's why the Japan could become one of the strongest countries in the world quickly.
0.0	Last, travelling to another sountry will provide a perfect opportunity for you to learn a foreign lanuage.
0.0	For instance, I believe that English is learned by most people in our country.
0.0	But many people cannot speak English fluently at present.
0.0	And why.
0.0	Probably, they lack a native atomsphere to speak English.
0.0	And travelling to an English country can offer them this environment which will be greatly helpful to their spoken English.
3.0	With the development of people’life， parents will pay more attention on education.
3.0	How to choose a right way to cultivate their children is a heated debate.
11.0	A lot of people have the opinion about parents should help children solve their mistakes and avoid them， because by the way children will be protected by adults.
11.0	However, there are many individuals strongly believe that parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes due to develop their independence and sharpen their personality.
10.0	I'm one of them, my reasons are as follows.
5.0	To start with, children who solve the problems by themselves can give them a deep impression and they can learn more experience about the issue.
8.0	For instance, my parents were really busy so that they even didn't have too much time to stay with me.
8.0	Hence,eveyrtime I met problem I had no alternative but to solve it by myself.
8.0	Besides, it's a valuable opportunity for me to gain experience and I could't make the same mistake next time accounting to the deep impression which remember in my heart.
8.0	Had my parents help me do anyting, I could't have much experience.
5.0	To top of that, if parents choose the way that let chidren make mistakes and solve them independently， their children will be more independent and no longer rely thier parents.
8.0	To illustare, my aunt always let my brother Tom do anyting by himself.
8.0	With time going by, Tom becomes more sensible and matured.
8.0	So I think it's extremely a good chance for children to sharpen thier personality.
2.0	There is no doubt that parents can help thier children to solve someting in order to waste their children's time.
7.0	On the other hand, I have the view that p
12.0	I don't assume that awarding children for their high grade with money is a good idea.
8.0	There are some reasons accounting for my view.
8.0	First of all, it's not helpful to help chidren have a proper definition of study.
8.0	They may naturally relate study with exams and grades instead of knowlege, skills and virtures that are more necessary, thus becoming students who may have good grades but lacks abilities.
8.0	Additionally, the behavior is likely to destroy the fun of study.
8.0	As what has been found, when the encouragement from the outside is too much, the inner interest can be replaced.
8.0	That is to say that a child may feel the happiness during study at the beginning,however, with the money given for the high grades,they start to study for money.
8.0	If one day they can not get money for study anymore,they will not find the happiness they feel and lose the interest in learing.
8.0	What's more, their attitude towards money can be influensed as well.
8.0	They have the impression that they should do most things for getting more money and they can get others do anything as long as they pay for it.
3.0	Nowadays, with the development of the modern society.
3.0	Whether the celebrities are more important to younger people or more improtant to the old people has triggered intense debate.
11.0	Many people think celebrities are significant for old people, they need it to remember and be proud of themselves.
11.0	However, I hold the opposite the opinion.
10.0	Young people nowadays always require more celebrities.
5.0	First of  all, the celebrities can encourage young people to innovate.
8.0	For the modern society, innovation is a essential part  to improve our technology and living standard.
8.0	And young people is the major resource of innovation.
8.0	Also young people always atract by the celebrity.
8.0	Celebrity can lead them become famous and own more porperty.
8.0	Therefore, under the celebrities they will work more hard to get a high celebrities and in the same time they will make more conturebution to the society and human beings.
5.0	Furthermore, with the highly pressure of the competetion of jobs, celebreties is more important for young people.
8.0	These days the famous and high paid companies always hire young people with good celebrities.
8.0	To better illustrate, I would like to take my brother as an example.
8.0	Last year he graduate from university.
8.0	He and his classmates were all facing the proble of getting a suitable job.
8.0	My brother spent three year in the military.
8.0	Thus, when people first know him will think that he is a hardworking and a brilliant people.
8.0	Therefore, you can imagine that he is the first people who get the high paid job in his class.
8.0	So you can concerne about how important for a young people to have good celebrities.
0.0	Without doubt that celebrities is also important for old people especially for those who made a great ccontribution.
0.0	Such as sodiers and scientists.
0.0	But comparethe human's future and history.
0.0	The future is more important than before.
0.0	And the young people is more improtant for the society.
0.0	Therefore, I think celebrity is more important for young people.
3.0	Do you like to challenge different tasks during the workday or easily finish the similar work all day long?
11.0	From my perspective, I will feel more satisfied when I have many different types of tasks to do, because I will develope the skills of facing different problems and have more fun during the work.
12.0	The specific reasons are mentioned below.
5.0	Doing many different work means different kinds of challenge, so I can improve myself a lot.
8.0	Just make some similar work easily is useless for my life and I can get nothing.
8.0	But things will be changed if I choose the formor one.
8.0	Take my mother as an exmple.
8.0	My mither had once tell me her own story that when she worked in the office, she just do some easy and same work to kill the time.
8.0	At last, what she got is just a little money.
8.0	But her young time is also passed.
8.0	She got nothing other skills.
8.0	She felt really regret and hope me not to copy her boring life.
8.0	After I heard my mother's own story, I tell myself the more I pay, the more I will get.
8.0	Thus, I cannot try to choose easy work to waste my young time.
8.0	What I shoud do is to challenge mysely and get some skills about how to solve different problems in my life.
8.0	Only do this I will feel satisfied about my life.
8.0	Young time is the time to chase.
5.0	Finishing different work will enable my life become more colorful and meanful.
8.0	But if I do the same work, I will feel extremely boring everyday and even get some mental illness.
8.0	To take one of my best friend as an exmple.
8.0	She used to be a really outgoing girl, but everything is changed after she work in her office.
8.0	What she does everyday is totally the same.
8.0	After a couple of months, she thinks that this world is dark and not funny anymore.
8.0	Even seriously, she got mental illness, because she cannot find any bright color in this world.
8.0	She feels boring everyday and she does not satified with her life anymore.
8.0	When I heard this, I know that if a person's life do not have any challenge, this person will never succeed at last and will also become desperate about life.
8.0	Thus, why not give ourselves some challenge to make our llike more interesting and funny.
8.0	At last, we can not only get money, but also become strong and brave.
0.0	All in all, to give our life some challenge can really help us a lot.
0.0	We will get to know how to solve the challenge soberly and finish them excellently.
0.0	Also, our life will become more bright and satisfied.
0.0	So why not try to choose different types of work to improve both our life and ourselves.
3.0	Nowadays, the opportunities for people are abundant.
11.0	So if someone have the opportunity to get a secure job, some people may considers to wait for a job that would be more satisfying.
11.0	However, I believe he or she should take it right away.
11.0	And I have several reasons to back up my idea.
4.0	First, even though the job is not so satisfying, we can gain experience from that job, which might be helpful to future career.
8.0	"As a saying goes"" no pain no gains""."
8.0	If we just stay at home and wait for another job that would be more satisfying, we would have nothing at that period.
8.0	To illustrate, there are two candidates whose acedemic ability are equally excellent.
8.0	However, the first candidate did not have working experience but the second has.
8.0	So when they started to become intership.
8.0	The first candidate could not deal the relationship among his leaders and himself, since his talking makes those leaders uncomfortable always.
8.0	But the second candidate knew the difference between talking to the leaders and workmates because he worked as a waiter before, and he knew how to deal with the conflicts.
8.0	Therefore, the second candidate acquired most of the staff's recommendation to become a formal staff.
8.0	So the experience is really necessary.
4.0	In addition, we might be not so satisfactory to that job at first place, gradually we might love that job.
8.0	Take myself as an example.
8.0	I did not like to stay with youth, because I thought they were noisy, boring and naive.
8.0	However, I accepted the opportunity to work in a kindergarten, since the salary is high.
8.0	I played with those kids even though the games were boring, and I taught those children to finish homework even if they were noisy.
8.0	Gradually, I found they were really cute and I love to stay with them since they were not so somplicated as an adult.
8.0	And I found myself become younger than before.
8.0	So I believe people should try those job even you thought it is not so interesting.
4.0	Granted, taking a job which is less satisfying might waste of time.
8.0	However, I think there is no definition of satisfying.
8.0	Since the desiration of people is endless, we do not know what kind of job is the most satisfying job to us.
8.0	Maybe this job is exhausted, the salary of that job is too low.
8.0	We should figure out the advantage of doing that job, like it is happy otr relac.
8.0	On the contrary, if we just stay at home and wait the best job to come, there is no beneifit to us.
2.0	So what will you choose next if you have an opportunity to have a secure job but that is not so satisfaying?
12.0	Nowadays, more and more people will travel in a group or go out with a tour guide.
8.0	But I think travel by myself is a best way for me.
8.0	First, I believes that trtavel by mtself can make me feel more interesting.
8.0	Last summer I went to Thailand with a chinese guide.
8.0	When I was saw a beautiful  traditional temple I was really interested in it.
8.0	I was to know the background story of this building.
8.0	But the tour guide simply introduced the structure of this temple and the houst of the temple and then she tooke us to the next spot in a hurry.
8.0	I felt very borring, so I have been to the Thailanf by myself last month.
8.0	I went to that temple again.
8.0	I carefully admire the wall painting and communicate with the local
12.0	Nowadays, we always will meet many project by our teachers which need students work toghther, in my opinion, i don not agree that the students can learn much more effectively than when they are asked to worj alone on project.
4.0	Firest at all, in nowadays society, communication is the really important skill to help ue get a better grades or a better life.
9.0	Teamwork needs  every group members talkwith each others and work toghther to finish their job.
9.0	In this way we can train our social skills greatly then it can help us get a better future.
4.0	Secoudly,a project on which must work together can help students get more ideals and more fancy pattern, when group members do their works toghther, they can exchange their own dieals and they can choose the best one, or they can mix their ideals toghther can get the most good ideal.
10.0	The group can get a good mark in this way and every single person of them can get many other ideals form their group members, in this way they can increase their knowledge and make themselves better and better.
4.0	At last, a group Project also can help the social activity in students, every time when you jion in a new group to finish the work together, you will meet a group of new peeson,In this way you may meet many different friends, and these friends who you know in a group projevt may can help you a lot in your future life.
10.0	In my opinion, more friends, more roads, when you meet more friends, you will get a more easily future because you will have many people to help you when you meet something bad that you can not contrul.
2.0	All in all when teachers assign projects on which students must work together is better than the projects which let students work alone on projects and group projects is much more effectively than projects by one person.
3.0	From my perspective,parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.
11.0	Bacause making mistakes is a certain things we have to experience in our lifetimes.
9.0	We make mistakes, we correct mistakes and eventually we learn lessons from them.
9.0	This is an routine we couldn't never get rid of.
5.0	For children,because they are lack of experience and knowledge,it is inevitable for them to make some mistakes in their daily life.
8.0	As parents,you shouldn't blame them when they make some mistakes.
8.0	If someone were always not making mistakes,he could learn nothing from it and he wouldn't never get some experience of life.
8.0	There are a sort of peole living in the world,who are afraid of making mistakes.
8.0	Because they are afriad of making mistakes,they even not try to do something they have never done.
8.0	They are just stuck into their own stubborn mind and finally they obviously couldn't be successful.
8.0	So,parents should let children make mistakes.
8.0	This is a definitely way they have to pass while growing up.
5.0	Neverthenless, not only should parents let children make mistakes but also they should let them learn from their own mistakes.
8.0	It is useless if only making mistakes but fail to learn something from them.
8.0	Experience and lessons are the most important things we have to get.
8.0	In this process,what children need most is the guidance of their parents.
8.0	What means let them learn from mistakes?
8.0	It means parents should lead the way for their children of understanding why they make mistakes and summarizing what they have learnt.
8.0	Only do children learn something from their own mistakes,they won't fall down at the same place next time.
0.0	As a conclusion,parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.
0.0	After all.
0.0	there is no better way for children to know themsel
3.0	Studying is necessary for everyone to improve theirselves, which is not work for money.
3.0	There are some parents offering their  school -age childern money for high scores they get in school.
3.0	In my oppion, it's not a good way for encourging their children studying.
11.0	It may be a worry way which will make their children misunderstand the purpose of studying.
6.0	I have a classmate who is wealthy and didn't have a good ability to get high scores.
8.0	In order to encourging him, his parents agreed to offer him money if he get high grade.
8.0	At the final exam, he was punished due to cheating in the exam.
8.0	He told his teacher the reason that he wanted to get the money offerred by his parents.
8.0	From this case, it's obvious that this way is not very good to help students to get better grade.
2.0	When i was young, i was usually told that you should study for youself and your future, definitily not for money.
8.0	The parents should tell us the method to study well.
8.0	they should pay more attention to their children, which is important for them to grow up.
8.0	There are no simple ways to get success.
3.0	I really disagreed with the statement, because I like the latter one that have a job where I work five days a week for shorter hours.
3.0	Actually, I was a girl that like doing diverse work evryday rather than do only one work for a long time.
12.0	The specific reasons are mentioned below.
5.0	Althoug the prioir one can save my time,  working five days a week for a shorter hours can improve my working efficiency, which means I can do more other work in a specific time.
8.0	If I work only three days a week for a long time, I will feel tired during the three days.
8.0	Because of the same work I do for a long hours, I will become exhausted.
8.0	Thus, my efficiency will decrease obviously.
8.0	However, If I do the work in five or more days, everyday I only need to focus for a short time.
8.0	Also, I can do some other things in remian time of everyday.
8.0	For instance, during the summer vation, I need to finish piles of homework in the only two month.
8.0	As me, I will divide it into many part and make a plan to finish it everyday.
8.0	And in the rest of the time, I will do some ther things like go shopping, playing tennies, listening to music and so on.
8.0	In fact, I can not only finish my homework in a high effiency, but also can have a relax everyday.
8.0	So why not choose to do the work in five days for a short time.
8.0	Therefore, I can apparently increase my efficiency.
5.0	In addition, working five days a week for a shorter time can help me develope the skill of making plans.
8.0	Indeed, having a job where I can work only three days a week for a long hours will let us develope the skill of focusing.
8.0	However, as a normal person, we do not need to make ourselves this tired.
8.0	Adversely, the making plans skill is more essential, because if we learn how to make a plan before we do it, we can decrease the chances of failure.
8.0	Choosing the latter one can help us sucess in a high possibility.
0.0	In my opinion, the latter one is better.
0.0	It can improve our working efficiency and learn the skill of plan making.
0.0	We do not need to make ourselves too tired.
0.0	Except finishing the work, we need have more relax everyday to lead a happy life.
3.0	Currently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among students: It is better to exchange emails with classmates and discuss in person.
11.0	Opinions vary from person to person, some claim that through emails is better.
11.0	However, contrary to their view comes my perspective that to communicate in person is the best way.
11.0	My point can be elaborated as follows.
6.0	First of all, communicating in person can improve friendship between classmates.
10.0	To be more specific, when we talk face to face with classmates, we will communi
10.0	On the contrary,
3.0	It is a good idea for parents to offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.
3.0	In childhood, some children may not realize the importance of studying, under this situation,  the chirldren will not actively study in school, they may think studying is very boring and tidious.
12.0	in this time, parents offer money as an encouragement for high grade, then the children can get the motivation of studying, and study for the goal.
6.0	In some scientfic experiment about animal emotion, scientists will give animals rewards to make the animals to learn some kind of skills.
8.0	In an animal experiment, scientists set the monkey in a cage with stones, then the scientists show that moving the stones out of the cage can receive food.
8.0	In this way, monkey can quickly know that stones should be removed from the cage.
8.0	This is the same of human.
12.0	Some people think that watching a movie or reading a book is very relaxed,but as far as i an concerned,doing physical exercise is relaxed.
6.0	Because i think doing exercise has some benefits.
10.0	First of all,doing exercise can provide opportunities for understanding new friends and learn the spirit of cooperation in group activities.
7.0	For example
12.0	Nowadays, there are a large number of parents who offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.
11.0	This is in heated discussion, since most of us don't know whether it's actually beneficial to children.
11.0	Although many people are not in favor of the behavior, I firmly believe that it's a quite effective method to teach children about the meaning of working hard and how to manage their own belongings.
5.0	To begin with, it priovides an excellent way to help their kids know why one is supposed to work hard to pursue a better development.
8.0	To be specific, a kid will know that it will pay back if he work hard and make a great output by getting a certain amount of money.
8.0	For example, my cousin's parents always award him money when he get a nice grade.
8.0	My cousin is encouraged by this little award and work harder than before.
8.0	He is not greedy, instead he is just affected by the achievement he got.
8.0	The money symbolizes good performance to him rather a bonus.
8.0	Therefore, I strongly support the opinion that a little award is of great significance.
5.0	Furthermore,many childern will learn how to manage their own belongings in this way.
8.0	The money just like their salaries.
8.0	It means they could decide how to spend it and where to spend it.
8.0	To illustrate,my uncle once worried about the issue that it  may be difficult to teach his child how to manage money reasonably.
8.0	After considerate thinking, he deided to take the method presented above.
8.0	Luckily, it received a perfect achievement.
8.0	My cousin has known how to spend money on appropriate things nowadays,which makes my uncle very pleasant.
0.0	It's true that the idea may cause some negetive effects on children including not value the process.
0.0	However,such effects could be avoided by considerate planning and instruction.
0.0	Above all,there is no method that could always result in expected results.
0.0	Now that the idea could bring the benefits above, I firmly in favor of it.
12.0	Undoubtebly, doing physical exercise like running or swimming will take a short time relax because when people feel tired, they would like to sleep and sleeping is a relax.
11.0	However, there are some other and perhaps more important that when muscle were recovering people would feel souring and this is not a good feeling.
11.0	Therefore, from where I stand agree more with the statement that mental relax is more comfortable, the reasons of which will be illustrated as follows.
5.0	In addition, watching a movie will relax our mental.
8.0	For one thing, it drives away my lassititude and helps me relax and relieve the pressure from work and study.
8.0	What's more?
8.0	It even puts me in a better mood and wards off the depression and pessimism.
8.0	For example, one day i feel tired because of the bad exam but when i watch a comedy i will feeling happy and relax than i will pay attention on my next exam.
8.0	For another, reading a book can full our mental world.
8.0	"As the saying goes,""Knowledge is power"", sufficient knowledge can carve out a way to sucess."
8.0	With more knowledge, our mental world was more fully and we would have a broader horizon to adjust our feelings and can figure our some possible solutons when we encounter a problem.
5.0	Initially, watching a movie or reading a book can make us learn some cultrue.
8.0	Specifically speaking, this is can definitely help me improve the understanding of the culture, custom, history and many interesting stuff about the movie's background or the writter.
8.0	Knowing cultrue will also make us have a broader horizon.
8.0	For instance, one of the most world's famous musician Ludwigvan Beethoven was a deef but he would relax on his articial create.
8.0	I read his story from a movie background and it was really stimulated me.
8.0	A great deef musician, how courage people and praise the art's power.
8.0	Accordingly, learn some cultrue will definitily make people feel relaxing.
2.0	To sum up, from what we have discussed, we may safely come to the conclusion that choosing watching movies or reading books is a rather wise decision bacause of mental relaxing, learning knowleges and cultrue made us have a broader horizon.
12.0	With the development of  modern society, an issue about who should help their communities has been heatedly discussed.
11.0	Is it more beneficial to require young people to spend time on helping their communities.
11.0	Or is it beneficial to let others do this.
12.0	Tough I cannot deny that young people should try to contribute to their communities, I strongly in favor of the piont that young people nowadays do not give enough time for helpong communities.
4.0	My primary reason is that young people, especially students, are too busy to help their communities.
8.0	The modern sociey is replete with high competition.
8.0	If students do not have required knowledge and skills, they will not be competitve enough, which means they might not gain great achievements in their future career.
8.0	Therefore students should try their best to equip them with knowledge and techiques, including spending too much time on their communities.
8.0	For example, I used to help people look after their gardens in my community when I was in my high school, from which I received  pleasure and contentment.
8.0	However, too much focus on helping the community distracted me from study.
8.0	Eventually, I failed my chemistry and mathematics in the final exams.
8.0	The staggering experience is proof enough for students not spending too much time on their communities.
4.0	An equal essential factor is that more contributions should be done by adults instead of the young.
8.0	Children are too young and less experience, who can hardly help communities too much.
8.0	On the contrary, adults have experienced a lot and they are more mature and skillful, thus helping the communities to develop from a larger aspect.
8.0	This point can be proved by the example of my uncle.
8.0	He is a worker whose job is to deal with the pipe.
8.0	Once  the pipe of my neighbour broke.
8.0	I had not idea about how to solve that problem because I didn't have the required knowledge.
8.0	However, my uncle only spent 1hour on working this out.
8.0	So adult are more efficient to help the community.
4.0	Admittedly, young people have many vacations in summer and spring.
10.0	However, they had better to use it for addition study in order to achieve high grades in class, which better prepared them for future career.
2.0	Judging from all the evidence provided above, we can confidently arrive at the conclusion that young peole do not give enough time to help their communities, not only because they are too busy, but also they can be replaced by adults in helping the community.
11.0	Nowadays, according to the development of transportation, many people will travel on vacation.
11.0	Most of people think that they benefit more from traveling in their own country than from traveling to foreign countries.
11.0	I think traveling in one's own contry can get many benefits, but not necessarily more than traveling abraod.
5.0	First, traveling abroud can practice your foreign language skills.
8.0	That is because people will learn one or several foregin languages in their own country, but we are surrounded by people who speak the same language as us, it is hard to get a chance to practice the foreign language.
8.0	If people travel abroud, they can fully practice their oral foreign language.
8.0	For example, My sister traveled to America last summer  vacation.
8.0	Before she went abroad, she though her spoken English was good enough, but only after she went abroad she realized how bad her accent was.
8.0	After half a month of life in the United states, by communicating with others, she learned to limitate the pronunciation and intonation of local people to weaken her accent.
5.0	Second, traveling abroad can exercise one's insependence.
7.0	Domestic travel can also exercise the ability to be independent, but no matter where you go
12.0	Np, I don't think it is a good idea.
8.0	I can not admit money is bad, but I can say use money this case is terrible.
8.0	School is a place where everyone get in based on their grade, not based on their money.
8.0	And it is not fair for others.
8.0	If every parnets start to offer money to school, it will be a disaster.
8.0	Their children may be bully in school, because they feel more prouder than others.
8.0	They may not no longer participate in school work, because they believe money can do everything for them.
6.0	And personally, I believe it is long-term, their parents may still face use money to solve problems in all kinds of situation.
8.0	Even worse, their children may be more dependent on money rather on their own.
8.0	What if they do not have money?
8.0	They might be live in the streets,or starve to death.
8.0	Why do they like this?
8.0	Because they do not have a skill, they been use money to solve things.
8.0	However, money is not dependable, you are dependable.
3.0	With the fiercer competition arising over the world, it is so essential for every student to do their best in every aspect of study, especially in grades.
11.0	Therefore, parents also try every means to stimulate their children to gain higher scores, one of which is offering more pocket money as an award.
5.0	Through one's whole life, incessantly studying always plays a cardinal role that it not only provides some expertise knowledge, guaranteeing us to take advantages over other competitors, but also it paves a long way to perfecting ourselves, arousing us to think over the meaning of life.
8.0	What I am willing to point out is that awarding children with money do contribute to high scores, however, it accompanies with high risk of losing the true motivation to further study.
8.0	Such behavior will in certitude narrowing children's horizons, only focusing on benefit but the real meaning of study.
8.0	It is easy to anticipate that a large number of children will be spoiled by the false incentive, thus leading to loss of interests in studying once they are not given some awards.
5.0	In my opinion, what parents should pay much attention to is not the stimulus,nor the high score, nor the content children gained from the class, but how interested they are in studying.
10.0	And that, of course,is the real core of educating, the rightest way of parenting and the best consequence of  studying.
3.0	With the development of technology, our society becomes better and better.
3.0	We have lots of choices on our daily life.
3.0	As the tasks becomes busy, people would under much more pressure than before.
3.0	Many people repeat their works day by day, they do the same kinds of jobs all day and have no time to rest.
3.0	And in this situation, why can't we change a perspective for life?
3.0	I firmly belive that workers are more happy to do different types of wokes than similar jobs all day.
12.0	Although they seems  have no differiences in working, but I can tell you the result is not just the same.
5.0	"There is a saying that ""varities of works, varities of lifestyles""."
8.0	It is true that change types of tasks to do can stimulate our energy to continue working, It has beneficial on transit the stressure and avoid so bored to work.
8.0	For example, my father is a tutor teacher in the primary school.
8.0	He majors in math, and he teaches it all the time until he has no passions on teaching.
8.0	And he applies to school for a second curriculum to teach basketballl, because he also make good progress in sports.
8.0	He teaches math in the morning and teach sports in the afternoon.
8.0	Increasingly, he found he has more power with kids, and gets more efficiency on teaching.
8.0	This way not only let him continue his mojor classes, but also make him get relax on body.
5.0	Doing differents kinds of  assignments could allow us blend in different work enviroments.
8.0	For instance, the famous businessman Jack Ma.
8.0	He did differents tasks everyday, he communicate with clients as a seller, and he write the essay about his company as a writer.
8.0	Also he always do charity for thouse who need help, he steped into schools and take good care of them.
8.0	So as we can see, if he only do similar tasks all day, he would not enable to make such a business, because he suits all kinds of people's life and feel much more satisfied.
1.0	Although do similiar tasks could keep us more professional in work, but other types of tasks also helps a lot.
1.0	As for our students, we can prepare for a test with different subjects in one day, like we prepare English at noon and take history at night.
7.0	It help us
3.0	As asked about what kind of companies prefer, most people would choose companies with satisfing environment.
3.0	But what a satisfing environment like?
3.0	Some people prefer well-paid, comfortable and simple work.
12.0	While in my opinion, a job with different sorts of tasks attracts me more, since it is not only a good chance to learn different knowledge, but also a job that I will never feel bored.
5.0	On one hand, kinds of different jobs means there are lots of things employee should learn so that they hold all the tasks in work.
8.0	When I was in the graduate school, I had been a teaching assistant for the undergraduate for one year and I needed to deal with all kinds of jobs everyday.
8.0	At that time, I needed two discussion sections to review class, 4-hour office hour to answer students' questions, and corrected all the homeworks.
8.0	To perform good in this job, I had to learn the course I taught by myself beside my own classes, I had to arrange my time for the office hours, I had reversed students' homework in my spare time, and as a foreign student, I have to improve my spoken English to make sure my students understand my presentation.
8.0	However I did it worse at the beginning, I got the higest rates in the last semester I've been teaching assistant after all my effort and I do increased in many areas, expecially the presentation.
5.0	Another reason is that taking different assignment in job could never make staff bored, since there are lots of choices when start work, which makes life full of challenges and interests.
9.0	Take my mother as example, when she was in a company as a researcher, she was satisfied everyday because she has lots of examinations and  However, employee who do similar tasks all day long may do better in this job, it is both bored staff and limited their intelligence.
9.0	Obviously, multi-task job is better choice for people.
2.0	In a nutshell, doing job with different types of task is not only good study method for staff, but also a good way to improve the stable of employee since they will not be bored with their job.
3.0	Nowadays parents pay more and more attention to children's education.
12.0	To encourage their children to study hard, they will give children money as a prize for each high grade achieved in school.
11.0	As for the phonomenon, I personally disagree with parents' choice of incentive method.
5.0	To begin with, the method concerning money may cultivate children's false value.
8.0	As we know, children's attitude towards money can be deeply influenced by parents's reaction to their progress.
8.0	They will regard money  important and do everything to meet his material satisfaction, which can induce them to make wrong choice in the future.
8.0	For example, someone may commit crime for money.
5.0	Apart from this, it is not a good way to help children develop interest in learning.
8.0	The intention to praise children is to encourage them to study harder.
8.0	So why don't you choose a gift assocoated with their study or learning?
8.0	such as an interesting book, or a trip to the museum.
8.0	It can not not fulfill our original goal but also contribute to children's comprehensive development.
8.0	moreover, children can meet some friends with shared interest.
7.0	All in all, I recommend parents to send their children some
11.0	I  agree this statement, because when you see someone strugging for something you may think that he will never stop trying to achieve his goal.
9.0	As a stranger，you may think that the man waiting for help and do not make forces to get his own goal is not worth enough to help,because even you have helped him,he will never know how to do things by himself or understand the courage he should pay.
9.0	Besides,no one will help a lazy man--he is worthless to be helped.
6.0	However the strugging man gives us a sense that he will never give up no matter how difficult the things are.
9.0	And we don not want to see him fail.
9.0	For example,LiuBei,the king of the Shu will never got the help from Zhuge Liang if he never strugled for his ambtious.
10.0	All in all,the stranger strugging for himself will never misses getting help from others.
12.0	To start with, offering ectra money as a reward can inspire children to study hard.
8.0	Most of young children believe that study is boring and difficult.
8.0	They refuse to enter schools by shout and cry, since it is hard for them to keep sitting in a quiet and insipid classrooms.
8.0	However, offering money to young children as prices for gaining high marks can not only enables them to persist on focusing on senseless courses, but also providing them knowledge that every effort should be paid back.
8.0	Take myself as an example.
8.0	Every time I get merit in my piano presentations, my father allows me to hang out with my friends and buy any commodies I like, such as dresses, toys and mosmetics.
8.0	So I am interested in study and doing research
12.0	Nowadays, there is a heated discussion regarding what you would you if the teacher or meeting leader says something incorrect in your opinion.
11.0	Attitudes toward this issue may vary from individual from individual.
12.0	Somebody thinks it's better to interrupt and correct the mistake immediately and someone else might inclined to ignore the mistake and keep silence.
11.0	Personally, I strongly believe that the best solution is wating till the assamble is done and and point the mistake out privately.
5.0	To begin with, wait until the meeting is over then point mistake out privately can avoid misunderstanding.
8.0	As someone states a point that you don't agree with, this is might not his mistake but you have something don't understand and mislead you to consider his opinion is incorrect.
8.0	No one can make true he or she is correct all the times.
8.0	So, sometimes is not the leader says something ridiculously, instead, we are the one with wrong prespective.
8.0	Point out immediately would probably embarrass ourselves.
8.0	To demostrate, once I was in a meeting, the group leader was presenting a loop code for our Internet system, but I found somewhere is wierd so I put up my hands and point it out immediately, but unfortunately, he used a quite different and much more efficent algorithm that I don't know.
8.0	I felt very awkward and dare not to say anything in the rest of the meeting.
8.0	If I didn't act in such a pushy way and discuss it after the meeting, I wouldn't feel so bad and I can really learn from this algorithm.
5.0	Secondly, wait until the assamble is done then point mistake out privately is better for the leader.
8.0	In many cases, leader do have mistakes even some are very tiny.
8.0	However, lots of small mistakes would lead to horrible damge.
8.0	So it's necessary and obligated for us to tell the mistakes.
8.0	Furthermore, pointing the mistake out immediately on the meeting is not a smart move because that would embarass the leader even this behavior is right.
8.0	So obiviously the best option in this situation is to tell the mistake after the meeting and the people are gone, it's a wise tactic.
2.0	To put into a nutshell, to avoid making misunderstanding or embarass the leader.
10.0	The best way to cope with leader's mistake during to meeting is pointing it to him or her after the meeting is done and people are gone.
12.0	In my opinion,I agree the statement that it is more enjoyable to have a job where you work only three days a week for long hours instead of five days a week for shorter hours.
5.0	In fact,it is more likely to save my  times to work only three days a week.
9.0	And I can have a good use of my work time to finish my assignment,after that,I can do what I want to do.
9.0	Personally,I am willing to complete my work in the same day and I do not want to delay it until the next day,because I think I should be respond to my work.
5.0	In the other hand,if I work five days a week for shorter hours,I will be a lazy man.
8.0	In the first day,I will consider that there is still 4 days and it is enough for me.
8.0	So maybe I will have a relax.
8.0	For the follwowing days,the  time is always enough for me.
8.0	Until the last day,maybe I start it,but everthing is late.
10.0	In addition to this,
3.0	As the development of our society, our live become better and better and many people have their own idol or icon.
12.0	Someone is interested in the privacy about the celebrity because if they get some hearsaies about the entertainers they feel that they understand their idol throughly.
11.0	However, I think that maybe we should give more personal space to the celebrity because they feel much stressed if their privacy are known by everyone.
11.0	Also, some celebrities in daily time are not as perfect as in our imagine, so if they do something bad, it will have bad impact on the society.
4.0	For starter, the celebrities will stress out if paparazzi follow them everyday because of the passion about their privacy from their fans.
8.0	Imagine that when you go out, someone will follow you   everytime because they want to get the scoop about the entertainers.
8.0	You will feel stressed because you don't want to make any mistake which will be reported to your fans.
8.0	If they keep stressed long time, maybe it will lead to dangerous result like suitcide.
4.0	In addition, some celebrities in daily life seems different from their behavior in show.
8.0	the reason some people like the entertainer is that he performs in some character well.
8.0	But the entertainer can't be the same as the character he performs forever.
8.0	If their fans find some differences in the entertainer, they will be disappointed and no longer like the entertainer.
4.0	Admittedly, some fans want to have some connections with the entertainers who they like by get some their privacy, so if the entertainer is willing to share his daily life with his fans, maybe he can get many fans than other.
10.0	But if the curiosity about other entertainer's privacy will disturb their life, it's an impertinent behavior because violate other's privacy is an illegal behavior so everyone should follow idol properly.
1.0	In short, we can't disturb the entertainer personal life because it will give them pressure that make them feel sick and this behavior is illegal.
1.0	So I firmly agree with the statement that famous entertainers and athletes deserve to have more privacy thtan they have now.
3.0	Making decision for young children is very cruial for their own, but some people think that parents make decision for them will be better, because they are too young to control themselves.
12.0	This question still is controvercial.
11.0	Personally, I believe that young children make decision for  their own will be better than let parents to make decision for them, because when they have some troubles, they could keep calm than in the past young children can not make decision for their own.
5.0	To begin with, young children make decision for their own, it can cultivate them when they meet some big things, they can calm dowm and think about how to deal with.
8.0	If let parents help them to make decision, they will accustomed to get help to their parents or others.
8.0	This ia an example, when young children go shopping with their family, and they lost direction.
8.0	Those young children who making decision for theii own, they could find the administration center, let the staff help them to find their parents.
8.0	They will get help for themselves are not depend on others.
8.0	However, the young children can not make decision for their own in the past,  they maybe stand some place cry and cry.
8.0	Waiting others come to ask them what happened in there.
5.0	Secondly, young children make decison for their own, not depend on their parents or others, it will help them to chose some things that they really want to do.
9.0	For instance, after they are finished their homework, they can chose some things they want to do.
9.0	Such as play baskterball with their friends or stay at home watching Tv for alone.
7.0	Young children that they make decisiom for their own, they will have choice to choose, but some children they are not ma
11.0	In my opinion,offering children money for high mark is good for both their study and development .
11.0	But if parents can change the present they give ,the result can be better.
5.0	First of all ,present for high mark can appeal children's willing to study harder ,as well as make their derection more clearer.
10.0	And ,as for children ,they can get what they want by using the money they earn by theyselves ,which can be more valuable than the gift their parents give.
5.0	Then ,as children earning money this way ,they can have a better understanding of work and money ,which can help them to be mature.
9.0	In the end ,however ,I hold the belief that parents should provide children with other things instead of money ,like family camp and kisses .
9.0	Because with money crowding into children's life ,they may ignore what is most valueable between they and parents ,love and the time they share together .
2.0	All in all ,I'm positive about money presented for high mark .
10.0	But ,meanwhile ,without money ,parents can do it better.
3.0	Currently, there is a debate between citizens.
12.0	Some people claim that people will spend more time with foods.
11.0	However, I would like to agree that we will spend less time cooking and preparing foods in twenty years than today.
12.0	Here are my reasons in the following.
5.0	One reason is that the development of technology is able to decrease our time cooking and preparing.
8.0	To be more specific, many kinds of roberts have been invented these days.
8.0	In addition, believe cooking robot will be present one day so that we do not need to cook and prepare by ourselves.
8.0	The roberts can do all these things instead which means the time we dealing with breakfast, lunch and dinner can be highly decreased.
8.0	For instance, I heard that one famous company is trying to create a robert who can take place of cooks in the restayrants.
8.0	After you set the ingredients of your meals and what kind of taste you like, the robert can cook it by itself.
8.0	In the same time, you can finish your work or watch your favourate movies.
8.0	It is obvious that highly developed technology do help us get away with cooking and preparing foods in twenty years.
5.0	Another reason in that we do not need to cook food, for the service industry will be completed.
8.0	As the time goes by, new restaurants which can supply all kinds of foods will appear and the delivery  of food can be more convient.
8.0	Therefore, we can get food from the restaurants quickly instead of spending too much time cooking and preparing it.
8.0	"As we all know, we can buy food though application such as ""MeiTuan""  and food will be delivered to us in less that  one year."
8.0	Maybe in the future, as soon as we call the restaurant to order a meal, a helicopter apper out of our window with the hot meal.
7.0	I think people will refuse to cook by themselves and order meal
3.0	With the development of the modern society, the stress of the young people is much heavier than before.
11.0	Moreover, to make the life in the modern society, many people consider that it's impotant for the young people to have the planning and organizing ability through the complex city.
10.0	However, there may be some people who disagree with this idea and they think it's no need for the young people to have the ability because they are too young to have the skills.
11.0	In my opinion, I think it's essential for the young people to have abillity to plan and organize in the mordern society.
5.0	First of all, young people will get the benefit in the future due to the ability of planning and organizing the life in their young age.
9.0	Because of the ability of the planning, young people will organize their life and work more regularly and more patiently to adapt to the modern complex life when they comes to be adults.
9.0	And with the ability, they will well organize their life and work to succeed in the modern society.
10.0	Additionally, it will be late for the adult to have the abiliy of planning and organizing skills if they don't have the ability in their young age.
5.0	Finally, when the young people have the ability to plan and organize, the society will be better.
10.0	Nowadays the
3.0	Do you influet in the class by your teacher?
3.0	Do you think by yourself during the class?
5.0	The teacher can not make sure that the social or political views of them are right,  which means that they may give the students some wrong thinking that may mislead them.
8.0	Because children in this time still do not have a very clearly views about the social or the political.
8.0	For example, during the secong world war, the Japenese teacher teach their student that in the future they should be loyal to the empire and they should occupy other country, even teach them to die on the war is very gloray.
8.0	So in the future these children invade other country and they have no rational idea when they fight on the war.
8.0	All of this is due to the teacher told them the wrong views in the class and these views not only hurt these children but also hurt the world.
8.0	Thus, I think teacher can not make their social or political views known to the students.
5.0	Second,  talking too much the view of the social and poiltical that belong to the teachers themselves can not cultivate the habit that to think independently and the critical thinking.
8.0	When people are young they need time to cultivate their thinking, that will help them at hunting job or acdamic study.
8.0	If the theacher teach the student to much, they will not want to think by themselves and they will be lazy to think in the future study.
8.0	In the future, they will join in the university and conduct some survey.
8.0	So in the class the professor just tell them a little part of the major the study and the most of the knowledge should be gained from thinking by themselves.
8.0	By these way, they could finish the paper to graduate because in the paper you should show something that belong to youeself.
1.0	All in all, to say the view about the social and the political in the class have so much drawback.
1.0	So I agree with this opinion.
11.0	I don't agree with this point.
4.0	Frist of all,a person can't live well with a heathly body.
8.0	So it means doing physical exercise is very important and neccesary.
8.0	Nowadays people's body health is worse than people in old days,it's excatly because people going for a movie in the cinema or staying at home just for reading a book.
8.0	If we relax by this way,which is really terriblely because our body is lazy,also leads to the unhealth body.
4.0	Secondly,nothing could be better than relax yourself by doing some exercise.
9.0	When people feel tired,the best way for relaxing is to go to sleep,and what's more is to exercising.
9.0	We can try to imagining this,when we feel tired ,a movie or a reading time cannot make people really energetic but the exercise, could do it.
4.0	Thirdly,nowadays exercise has became a popular way for relaxing.
9.0	Some sports clubs are popular in many devolping cities,people accept it as a kind of fashion.
9.0	It is easy to know that it's more interesting when people go for exercise with friends than staying at home with only a book.
0.0	Everyone should love itself, nothing could instead of how physical exercise brings to us.
0.0	Instead of relaxing by watching movies or reading books, we'd better go out for exercrsing.
0.0	Only by sitting there quietly can't we get a energetic body for the daily life .
0.0	People should defeat the tiring by training the bodies dat by day,which can help making a great progress.
3.0	In such a state-of-art of the prospective era, people become more likely to pay more attention to the careers.
3.0	Nowadays, there is an increasing number of people invest an issue that whether it was easier to identify what type of career or job would lead to a secure, successful future, and this provokes a heated debate.
11.0	Some holds that effect to the future of career in nowadays is as the same the past.
11.0	As for me, it is definitely easier to identify what career would lead to a better life in the past.
6.0	Few things can be more easier than identify a job which would lead to a successful future.
8.0	For instance, all of us should have known Jack Ma, who is the richest man in China.
8.0	Of course, he was not a rich man in his primitive life, but just an English teacher in a conventional college.
8.0	Once a time, he addressed a thought that the internet will have the most potential in the future, but there was no one being willing to help and invest in his idea.
8.0	Then, not long later, his idea was praised by a company in Japan and he got his fisrt investment finance to his internet provision.
8.0	And we know he succeed at last, and became the big daddy of the biggest shopping website in China.
8.0	As a result, it is not hard to identify what type of career would lead to a successful future because we could have more opportunities in the past.
2.0	By contrary, for such a high technology world which is filled with talented people and fierce competition in various kinds of occupations.
10.0	And it is really tough for us to be prominent in any profession if we only have a thought.
7.0	This is because we must be goo
12.0	I think as people grow up, they become more influenced by friends than teachers.
12.0	Though it also has individual diffrence, generally speaking, I think people over 18 years old are more influenced by their friends than by their teachers; people whose age is 3-18 may be more influenced by their teachers than by their friends.
4.0	As we know, people were born with nothing except their genes.
8.0	The new baby know nothing about the world.
8.0	After their birth, they began to learn.
8.0	Through psychology, we know that people have their ability to learn by their mirrow neuro, whose function is just copy others' behavior.
4.0	let's think about when we were young, before kindergarten, did our parents tell us to listen to teacher in kindergarten?
9.0	I think  most of us were told that at that time.
9.0	So when we were in kindergartens, we will focus on what teacher said and did and just copied them.
4.0	In addition, because of many reason, such as culture, media and many other things.
9.0	We always think teacher is elder people, we should respect them and they are great.
9.0	That is also why we would learn from teacher but not our friends.
4.0	But as people become older, people's brain become more and more complex and specific.
8.0	People become their own style of their behavior.
8.0	And we know that teacher is just a job, not anything other.
8.0	We would hardly to copy teacher's behavior.
8.0	What's more, after 18 years old, we would in the university.
8.0	In this situation, we would be told to do some research.
8.0	We know that research need hypothesis and methods.
8.0	What teachers can tell you is just methods, especially past methods.
8.0	Our thinking are more relying on our life and experience, which is more influenced by our friends.
4.0	So because of these reasons, after 18 years old, we will become more independence and we will have our own life circle.
10.0	Main influence to our may come from the circle, in which there are no our teachers.
1.0	So I think people are more influenced by their teachers than by their friends when they were young.
1.0	But as they grow up until 18 years old, they may be more influenced by their friends than by their teachers.
3.0	When I was in high school, my teacher always let us finish our homework without internet.
3.0	In contrast, nowadays many professor let their students to search references and upload their works through the internet.
3.0	This comparison leads me to think whether the government should provide free internet connection all over the world since internet is really a big deal in the contemporary society.
11.0	Personally, I think it's not wise to provide this sevice to the public.
5.0	First of all, for those workers, internet can be harmful to their health.
8.0	As a authoritative reporter stated, nowadays many young people uses internet seven, or even eight hours a day, which is a huge amount of time.
8.0	As we all know, staring at the computers' screen is crucially harmful to eyes.
8.0	As a result, if the government provide free internet connection to the public, young workers will be able to use free wifi everyday without paying anything instead of their health.
8.0	Consequently, there will be more people have diminution of eyesight because they cannot prevent themselves from keeping using the internet.
5.0	Moreover, free wifi also do harm to the teenagers.
8.0	As you can imagine, young kids cannot control themselves.
8.0	If they are free to using internet all the time without rules, they are more likely to watch TV, play computer games, or read comics by th internet connection.
8.0	So they will be keep focusing these things rather than what they have to learn and are less and less able to pay attention to their curriculum.
0.0	Actually, free internet sevice has positive impact on the public.
0.0	Many people cannot have internet connection and they maybe miss some important message comes from their relatives or employer.
0.0	Therefore, they may lose a relationship or a job.
0.0	However, the negetive impact is more important.
0.0	Free wifi may causes the government a large amout of money which should be used to build cities' facilities.
0.0	And this leads to a result that those cities' equipment cannot be repaired just in time.
3.0	There are always viaries of things happend all over the world every day, some people only read those news related to their daily life but ignore those far away from them.
11.0	However, I think it is necessary to know as many events as we can to be a knowledgable person and to own others respect.
5.0	There is no doubt that studying is a life long task for everyone, and in my opinion, people can learn a lot from daily news.
8.0	The development of techonology and Internet make it come true that people can know everything happend in any corner of the world.
8.0	In daily life, people could know friends's recently news from their social media, such as the birthday party photos Anna posted on facebook.
8.0	Besides, people also know important annoucement posted by government on official website.
8.0	If a person gaspe all these news, he or she could learn a lot of experience from others and avoid to inturd gorvernment recent policy.
8.0	My mom is this kind of person.
8.0	There was one time that her friend forgot to bring his ID when he took a metro line, because of this mistake, he missed the train in the end.
8.0	My mom noticed that and she doubled checked her ID everytime she went out, the result is my mom never forgot her ID so that she never missed any trains.
8.0	That is why concerning about friends events would help people accumulate experience and being knoledgable.
5.0	Another reason is that know a lot about events around the world would help people gain others respect.
8.0	There is a famous host in my city called Jamie and every citizen takes him as a person knows everthing and everyone respect him.
8.0	Jamie is a host of a talk show, although his guests are from different areas, Jamie could talk the latest nes in their study areas, from artist to outer space, which suprised most guests and audience are all surprised and respect him a lot.
8.0	From Jamie's story, I come to realise that brodening scale of knoledge would own others respect.
10.0	Although paying attention to events happening around the wourl may spend a lot of time, it is worthy and people could read news for 30 minuetes before they go to bed.
2.0	In my point of view, concerning frients activities and international news are both help people accumulate experience but a way to own others' respect although sometime these news seems unrelate to us at a
3.0	Do you thinks always telling truth is a right things?
3.0	Will you sometimes make some lies because of special situations?
11.0	From my perspective, I think always telling the truth is not the most important considerations in any relationship between people.
5.0	A kind lie can really help to recover some relationship actually in some certain conditions.
8.0	Take mself, the only children of my family, as an example to illustrate my own point of view.
8.0	Once upon a time, my family readily enjoyed my parents' birthday party with a lot of friends.
8.0	But unfortunately, I felt really stressed because of the difficult assignments given by my teachers and peer pressures from my classmates.
8.0	Thus, my mood fell down in a high speed and even want to cry when I was alone and get really low grades also .
8.0	However, I expressed nothing on my face and sang with my parents happily.
8.0	When they asked the recent study condition of me, the responces of me were always positive.
8.0	What I think is that in oder to have a positive atmosphere in my parents birthday party and not destroy their mood, I choose to tell a kind lie at that moment to build a more intimate relationship between my parents and I.
8.0	"But at the second day, I told the truth to my parents and they said to me"" you are a really good girl and in order to give us a happy night, you endure the stress by yourself."
8.0	"Thanks to your lies, we love you forever!"""
8.0	I felt really surprised of my parents suddenly expression of love to me.
8.0	And I really realize the importance of not always teeling truth in some certaion situation.
5.0	Always telling truth is indeed a significant consideration in any relationship to show a kind of honesty; however, this is not the most important and there are some other things should be highly regarded.
8.0	Zhutin, a Chinese volleyball palyer, is a typical instance to support this.
8.0	In his own autobiography, she says that mutal trust between any relationship is more important, which means if two people really trust each other, they will not haggle over every ounce and even suspend reliability of each other's langauge, and they will do is to trust others mind and understand each other if they need to conceal something which can not be told.
8.0	If you can trust each other forever, this realation can be preserved and is worth proteting in the rest of life.
2.0	In summary, telling a kind lie should be regarded an essential way to help strengthen any relationship and trusting each other is the most important consideration in any relationship rather than always telling truth.
12.0	In the comtemorary world, we all be defined by different labels and ability, even many people be effected by those word.
11.0	Some people think that leadership is a natural ability, and cannot be learnd over time.
11.0	As far as i am concerned, every one can obtain the ability of leadership.
10.0	I will give my reasons and example in the following paragraphs.
5.0	Firstly, human's learing ability is undoubted.
8.0	Throughout the entire history of human development, human's learing ability can be reflected on everywhere, at firest people can learn how to use tools or how to make weapon, and because of those human can exist to now.
8.0	For example, I have a friend, before she was a shy girl, but when she promoted in her company as a leader, she found she need to learn how to manage a disition.
8.0	Through many famour people's bood, the key of as a leader is be understood, and she mastered it, so finally, she is good at being a leader.
5.0	Secondly, leadership depends on people's trust.
8.0	Becoming a leader not because they possess leadership, but people are willing to support them.
8.0	Even though a person really has leadership, not one trust him, it is also meaningless.
8.0	For example, my ancle in our whole family is a leader, everyone trust him, but the reason not he has leadership but he is older than us, so we listen to his order.
3.0	As the society keep moving forward canstantly,the people in modern city are getting more stressful.
12.0	So,how to cut the pressure down become another significant skill we have to be equipped with and wihout which we may not cope with the life easier and happier.
5.0	There are two most common ways of relaxing--silence or moving.
8.0	In a quiet way,you could just stay at your comfortable home watching a movie as well drinking some wines.
8.0	While watching movies,you don't have to so consentrated or have any aim,just let your mind go with wind.
8.0	When you are blue,a comedy canbring you countless joy.
8.0	When you are frustrated,a cheerful movie may give you new hope and guide you to a new life.
8.0	Whatever bad emotion you have,you can bury it in movies siently and freely.
8.0	To experience another people's life is also a way to please yourself.
8.0	Since everybody diffrerent in life,compare your own life with other's,you will cherish your part of life.
8.0	Later on,when backing to your real life,you would have already known:it's yourself that should be to blame for yourself ,to make your life brilliant is what you should do whereever you are.
5.0	On the country,I personally don't  agree with a way which uses a more hard and struggling theory to ease the stress.
8.0	Life is not math,there is no so-called lose and lose is gain.
8.0	Blindly to plus more sweet to your body is not just.
8.0	Iargue that human is not king of machine,we need relax specially in a more warm and quiet way.
8.0	In that peace ,to talk to yourself ,to reflect on yourself.
8.0	When time is up,you are prepared,you will be more efficient and powerful.
2.0	No matter what you are going through,yourself can ease everything.
12.0	In China, many parents will give material reward to their children who get high grade at school.
11.0	As for these parents, they think it's a good way to encourage their children to study harder.
12.0	But maybe, it develops bad habits of their children.
9.0	Material reward may make your child utilitarian, they study just for grades, money and material not for academic.
9.0	It's very sad.
6.0	The students will lost interets in studying.
8.0	Later, they wil go to high school even college and choose their major.
8.0	Whenever they make these choice, it based on material gain not interests.
8.0	They get higher education just for the diploma and make more money after their graduation.
8.0	You can't have a good knowledge of what you are major in.
2.0	In conclusion, I don't think some parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school is a good idea.
3.0	As we all know, the pace of changing of the world accelerates.
3.0	A marjority of people feel that it is difficult to keep the pace of the world.
3.0	And peple are become less happier than a decade or two decades before.
3.0	While some people holds that quick changes are tolerable, some other people disagree.
3.0	From my point of view, I tend to approve the latter.
3.0	To adjust for the quick change of the world, many poele have missed many great moments and experience in life.
5.0	To start with, the slow pace of life gives people more time and space to feel the little happiness in life.
8.0	Most of people spend their time on making money.
8.0	They pursue high quality of life which is based on money.
8.0	Thus they work from early morning to late night.
8.0	Except for sleeping and eating, they have their all time spent on obtain more fortune.
8.0	These people gradully forget that there are much more improtant things outweighing more than work.
8.0	They are less happier than those who pay their attention on living rather than earning a living.
5.0	Secondly, the rate of suicice inceases in recent years.
8.0	The main reason lies on the high pressure from life which originates from fast changing of life.
8.0	What values in human's life are love and the ability to love.
8.0	Fast changing makes people feel more about the unstability of life, which indirectly cause them lose faith of life.
8.0	Without faith, the significance of life for them is vacant.
8.0	They lose interests to live, which may result in their suicide.
1.0	To conlude, the point that fast change and quick pace of life make people beome more unsatisfied and unhappier is ture.
1.0	Consequently, we should learn how to overcome difficulties in life and to keep in faith about life.
11.0	There is always such a word that some persons are born to be leaders, which means that if you are not a born leader, you would never have cross with being a leader.
11.0	However, the leadership is a kind of skil rather than talent from my point of view, something definitely can be learnt by all of us.
11.0	I attribute the statement to two general aspects, character and skills.
5.0	As one can say, the leaders around us are almost outgoing and determined men in their great genes.
8.0	The fact is true but not reason.
8.0	It's undoubtedly a truth that we are born with our unique characters that cannot be changed easily.
8.0	But it is never the reason for a person's leadership.
8.0	Taking the famale leaders as an exmple, totally with no offence, it could be a general fact that famale is the humbler gender and they are destined to be afraid of speaking for themselves or their people.
8.0	And famale is the more emotive one, which makes them much inferior.
8.0	But the fact of human history goes against this statement or these thoughts.
8.0	The situation is that we do have famale leaders in politics and all kinds of business, and they are doing the same things as male ones, or even better.
5.0	The other point is about skills which would just explain why our humble and emotive women can lead us.
8.0	The skills of leadership consists of two important parts.
8.0	The first one is recognition of oneself.
8.0	Only we recognize which kind of persons we are can we find the right direction.
8.0	For those women leaders above, they definitely have a clear idea about their pros and cons.
8.0	And the they come to the second part of change.
8.0	As one knows himself and what he wants to be, it's  the courage of change pulls the trigger and wise plans of change makes sure that he will hit the goal strongly and confidently.
1.0	To have a conclusion, I do not agree with the statement of born leadership for the character of us and changes mede by us.
1.0	As lond as one have the recognition, courage and trategy, he can be a leader.
12.0	In such a highly competitive society, people are paying an increasing amount of attention to childrens' grade, and some students may not have a big furious whit learning, so parents has tried many ways encouraging their children devote themselves into study.
12.0	And this hs never failed to arouse widely social concern among the general public.
4.0	There is a heated discussion regarding whether parrents should offer their kids with grade they get or not.
8.0	Different people have different opinion.
8.0	And my view will be expplained that I agree with with this way.
8.0	There are thrre main reasons for my position.
4.0	First, I think this way can let them know that HARD WORK PAYS OFF, because every child has their dream thing, may it is a toy car,  or a interesting comic book, sometimes their parents may not pay for these things, however if I can get my own money, I can buy the ting i want, but it can only have the money by study hard, you pay, you get back, and if they know this rule when they are only a child, they can work harder at every thing in their future.
4.0	Second, because they can buy the things they like, and make their life happier, they can understand that KNOWLEDGE CAN CHANGE THE LIFE, AND STUDY CAN MAKE LIFE BETTER, it is not just a principle, if they want to make their life better, they have to study better, if they can alway get a good grade in school, they can get into a good university, find a good job, and finally get  high paid, they get the things they want, they understand this rule, and they will teach their children with the same way,is it not good?
10.0	Last, theycan know that they can only depend on themselves, because you can not get a good grade without study by yourself, so they will do everything in the future on their own, not asking for help, this is good for their future , too.
7.0	Judging from all this evidence, Ibelive that parents sho8uld offer money if their kids g
3.0	Have you ever seen a rich man possess more than three cars even if he doesn't need so much?
3.0	Have you ever thought about buying a nice car when you have enough money?
3.0	The answers are certainly.
11.0	Even if more and more people advocate not to buy cars and have a green life, in my opinion, there will be more cars than today.
4.0	To begin with, because of the increase of the popularity, more people will buy cars.
8.0	From 2008 to now, the popularity of China have almost increased one hundred million people.
8.0	And the experts predict that there will be more and more people in China.
8.0	Take my aunt for example, even if she had two children, she and my uncle want to bore one more child.
8.0	Since the car is a necessary vihchel in our life, most of children will buy cars when they grow up, which cause the amount of the cars.
4.0	And what's more, a lot of rich man like to buy more than one expensive cars to satisfy their vanity.
8.0	Nowadays, a important factor to assess whether a man is rich is to see how many cars he has.
8.0	And with the develoment of the economy, more and more people become rich.
8.0	Hence, they will buy more cars even if they don't need.
8.0	For instance, last week, when I walked back home after studying a whole day, I saw a house in my housing estate parked four beautiful sport cars, each of them value ten million dollars.
8.0	After that, I insist that most people when they become rich, will buy more cars, which contribute to more cars exist in the future.
4.0	Moreover, some people may think that people can ride bikes or take buses instead of driving cars.
10.0	But as far as I am concerned,
12.0	Nowadays, some parents offer their schoola-age children money for each high grade(mark) they get in school.
8.0	For example, my brother is studying in high school, when he get food grades, my uncle will give him some money for what   he want to buy.
8.0	Because they are willing to see that my brother get good grades and they hope that my brother will be admitted into famous university.
8.0	As far as I am concerned, this behaviour is wrong.
8.0	And I will explain my opinion.
5.0	First, this behaviour will change children's attitude and opinion of getting good grades.
8.0	If their parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school, the children will equal getting good grades to money instead of achieving some goals or becoming an outstanding person.
8.0	And children will study hard for money rather than admission of famous university, it will change their attitudes and opinions.
8.0	For example, when I ask my brother what you want to do in the future.
8.0	His response which suprises me is that he want get more money from my uncle and aunt.
8.0	I think what he said is absolutely wrong, this is a  wrong values.
8.0	We are supposed to attain a higher level instead of getting much money from our parents.
5.0	Second, it may cause cheating.
8.0	Because when a child get money from his or her parents, which will make him or her   happy.
8.0	However, when the next exam is coming, the child may want to get money again, he may want to cheat instead of studying hard.
8.0	The parents may want to encourage their children to study hard, in contrast, their children may not work hard so that their real grades will decrease.
8.0	For example, the son of my mother's friend had cheated his mom for a long money because of money.
8.0	When he took the college entrance examination, he got so bad grades so that he was not admitted into any university, his money was angry and upset.
8.0	I also felt very sad for his moher.
1.0	In conclusion, I think this behaviour is wrong.
1.0	Study is study instead of money.
3.0	As people's lives are getting better and better, people are not really satisfied with the money they have already gotten.
12.0	People are having a eager to explore out of their zones and to work harder in other developed cities for a life of higher quality.
12.0	Some people advocate this idea for the better life people can afford to their famlies.
10.0	However, as for me, I strongly believe that this way to make money is improper for following reasons:
4.0	First of all, it brings negative influence on the person himself.
8.0	Being far away home can be really lonely--- Nobody will help you to make meals when you are tired after working for a whole day; Nobody will look after and care for you when you feel sick or get ill.
8.0	Everything might be fine at the begining, but there would be problems if a man stay away from home for a long time.
8.0	The person would under a big depression and gradually he may develop some serious mental illnesses.
8.0	In this case, what's the good of the high salaries when it is at the expense of one's health?
8.0	The person loses more than he can receive.
4.0	Secondly, leaving families and friends also hurt your friends and family memmbers.
8.0	Everyone is an indispensable part for their lovers, so one's leave really creates sadness and pain.
8.0	"Last year I took part in a activity whose topic is "" pay attention to the left-behind children""."
8.0	When I asked the children what their biggest wish was, they told me that they just wanted their parents' company.
8.0	Some of them even shed tears.
8.0	I think this scene must be something that parents, the outside worker, do not want to see.
8.0	As a result, there is no point of working outside considering that love is much more essential than money.
4.0	Admittedly, high-salary job enables people to have more money.
8.0	However, money can sometimes be a bad stuff.
8.0	Too much money may make people go astray especially when people are alone without people's visibe or invisible supervise.
8.0	In this situation, low-paid jobs have their own advantages of restricting people's behaviors.
10.0	In a word, it is not worth exchanging our company for families and friends for high-paying jobs considering the harm on both you and your lovers and the disadvantages of too much money.
2.0	Then, let us give up the job when it is at the expense of family bond and our friendship.
11.0	whenever the century is , people eager to have a stable and high salary job which can bring them self- satisfaction.
11.0	However, in the twenty one century, the basic requirements has become harder to acheive since the marking reqiurments has become more diverse and more advanced.
10.0	Therefore, in my opinion,  in the past,  it was much easier to identify what type io job which would lead to a secure and successful future.
5.0	Initially, due to the inceasing types of jobs and high educaiton rate, it is hard to judge compare the choices made by people.
9.0	In the past, only few people can go the high schools even universities,  Compare to the recent socity, nearly 90 percent people has been educated in the universities,  or even gone abroad.
9.0	Therefore, they may more focus on their own attitude towards the life instead of the salaries they can get.
5.0	In addtion, the creteria, in anther word, description of the successful future has bees changed dramatically.
8.0	In the 20th century of China, people might think that a stable and successful job is to be a teacher or a governor.
8.0	However, theses days, for a designer, the success is to go to the fashion show; for a actor, the success is to get famous and so on.
8.0	The successful job depends on the goal that has become more individual.
2.0	According to my own opinion, compare to the past, it is harder to identi
3.0	In the recent decade, regular physical exercise has become a prevailing trend all over the word, especially in large and prosperous cities.
3.0	People take on jogging, yoga or even some very fierece and labor-demanding activities to let off steam.
12.0	However, I believe that watching a movie or reading a book is more desirable a way for us to take a break.
5.0	Those who make exercise a regular part of their lives are mainly college students and white-collars.
9.0	For them, time is so precious that they have to take in information all the time; otherwise they cannot catch up with the social pace.
9.0	In this sense, reading an informative book or watching a meaningful movie seems more reasonable as not only does it offer us valuable information we are badly in need of, but it helps us to learn something even in the process of taking exercise.
5.0	Another evidence for my viewpoint lies in the fact that plenty of people, when taking exercises, tend to hurt themselves.
8.0	A number of people only take exercises to follow the fashion.
8.0	They are not aware of the points they shoud pay attention to during the exercise.
8.0	For instance, although jogging is a much favored activitiy, few know that our knees might get hurt if we did not accomplish the warming up activities properly.
8.0	Some of the injuries are simply irrevocable and incurable.
8.0	Comparatively, a light reading or an episode of film clips is a much better choice as it does not hurt us easily, nor does it make us feel exhausted after the exercise.
0.0	Anyhow, it is hard to deny the advantages contained in the sporting exercise.
0.0	After all, a strong body is the guarantee of a successful future.
0.0	However, it is my opinion that the importance of physical exercise ought not be over-rated.
0.0	Not every member of the society needs intensive exercise.
0.0	More often than not, to wind down by doing some reading or watching some TV is a more rational alternative.
11.0	I don't agree that it's better to relax by watching a movie than relax by doing physical exercis.
11.0	In my opinion, relaxing myself is one thing that put off my mind.
12.0	However, I can't get any rest from watching a movie or reading a book.
5.0	Doing physical exercise maybe causes person feeling tired, but at the same time it also make people put off their minds.
9.0	After studying for a long time or coding over the whole night, I would like to go out and have light sports with my friends.
9.0	Then we usually take a shower and talk about something that happened recently in our university.
5.0	While I am doing some sports like badminton, I feel my fat is discreasing.
8.0	The physical exercise also can keep a good body.
8.0	I don't need another activity to keep the balance of my health.
8.0	I can have a perfect nap after my exercising which can bring me better life quality.
7.0	Although it is suitable to watch a movie lying in a sofa to relax myself,
3.0	Recently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people: whether people should follow their hearts and chase their ambitious dreams.
3.0	Opinions vary from people to people.
3.0	Some claim that people are supposed to be more realistic.
11.0	From my point of view, I wholeheartedly agree that people need to with great ambitions and pursue dreams bravely.
12.0	My point can be elaborated as followed.
5.0	First of all, ambitious dreams can bring lots of motivation and enthusiasm to people's lives.
8.0	As we all know, when people have a dream and the dream seems quite hard to accomplish, even they just can get small progress every day, they must feel satisfy because they get closer and closer to their aims which normal people rarely dream about.
8.0	For example, I have a cousin who named Jack, he dreamed to be a leader of a company when he was a child.
8.0	But he never gave up this dream and after that he voted to be the monitor every year and gradually became a greater leader of his class which made him lived in a happy environment every day.
8.0	So after he graduated from the college, he entered in ALIBABA Company, and seize every chances to learn things to rich his management skills which really motivate him and give him enthusiasim.
5.0	Second, ambitious dreams make people be more successful than others.
8.0	As we all konw, if people have a ambitious dream, they would fight for it, even they give up someday, the knowledge and experiment they learned before are also a fortune for them, which definitely have a good influence for their future.
8.0	Take myself as example.
8.0	I used to dreaned to be a teather so I learned a lot about how to communicate with children.
7.0	However, I gave up this dream on
3.0	Today have many way to encourage studens to study .
12.0	Give they money is also one kind to make them to study harder ,So I think it's a good idea for parents to offer their school-age children money for each high grade （mark) they get in school.
5.0	As we konw , if one has a power they will can do a good thing.
8.0	Give them money is a way to get them strength so that them can concentrate more or get money for that perpose.
8.0	Give them money at this time is equivalent to aforce to push them forward so that they can learn better.
8.0	For example,I have a classmate,he dosen't like study but he like money.
8.0	He can only use to give him money in order to let he study harder.
8.0	His parent tell him if hie grades improve ,he will get the money according his grades.
8.0	After that maybe in order to get money he learn even every time he can.
8.0	Gradualy study harder becomes his habit.
8.0	Then he get high grade and success.
5.0	Sometimes , money is juest a guide line, but when they get used to it and have more knowledge ,the money is meaningless.
8.0	This is indeed a good way to give students money to encourage them to learn.
8.0	It can make them feel that they can not only benefit from their efforts, but also can feel the joy of learning from them.
8.0	So why we don't use this way?
2.0	There are many ways to reward students, but giving them money is a way to reward them,so Ithink this is a good idea.
12.0	I strongly disagree that it is better to relax bt watching a movie or reding a book than relax by doing sports.
11.0	I am a sports fans and i really enjoy doing sports.
12.0	When i am tired, i will go out to play basketball with my friends or go swimming for an hour.
11.0	After doing sports , i do not fell so sreesful and i am energetic again.
5.0	In my opinion , there are two ways to relax yourself .
8.0	There are physically and mentally.
8.0	When you are doing sports your muscles are moving,your whole body gets a fully erexcise you will fell very comfortble.
8.0	It is also good for health.
8.0	Meanwhile,your brain do not to consider a lot, you do not need to think about anything.
8.0	you get a great chance to let your brain have a rest.
8.0	When you do the sports , most importantly you will gain happiness.
8.0	you will find the life much easier!
8.0	So doing sports can relax you both physically and mentally.
5.0	Watching movies or reading a book is a good way of wasting time but it is  not the best way to relax.
8.0	while you are reading or watching a film you need to think.
8.0	Thinking about the characters in the book or movie, thinking about the logic in the stories.
8.0	In another word, your brain are still working, maybe in a more tireder condition.
8.0	Let me give me an example, why does the baby fell into sleep when he listen to his mum's story?
8.0	Because the baby need to think a lot about the story and the brain feels tired so that the brain stops working and have a rest.
1.0	You see the best way of relaxing yourself is through doing the sports.
1.0	It can make your bodyand your brain comfortable.
7.0	when you feel tired, just go outside to do some spor
3.0	Today, there is a debate whether students could study effectively when they work with other students together or when they do the assignments by only themselves.
3.0	Some people think, students can learn better by working together with other students.
12.0	However, I think working alone on assignments is the most effective way for studying.
5.0	To begin with, doing assignments alone benefits students to choose the topic they like.
8.0	To illustrate, students can choose the topic whatever they are interested in without compromising with others.
8.0	When they deal with the things which is interesting, they might work hard with it and even make profound research with it, so they can study effectively.
8.0	By contrast, if students need to work with other students on some assignments, it is hard for them to make a consistent decision.
8.0	Even though they choose the same topic, it is hard to assign different parts of the assignments.
8.0	During this process, some of the students would do things which they are not  eager to do.
8.0	My experience is a good case in the point, last semester, our history professor ask us to do an assignment together.
8.0	It is an assignment about the history of the war.
8.0	I really like this topic, and if I could do it alone, I could donate all my enthusiam in it.
8.0	Some of our member wanted to study in the Chinese war, and they wanted to focus on the impact of life put by the war, which I was not interested in.
8.0	In the end, I finished my part of the assignment and did not get any achievement.
8.0	I do not think I learn it well from this assignment.
5.0	What's more, working alone on projects is good for students get impress
2.0	In general, I think finishing the assignment alone is better for learning, since it is not only good for studying profoundly, but also good for getting deeply impression about the knowledge.
3.0	A secure career plays an important role in the news.
3.0	People always have different opinions about whether is secure of some career.
3.0	Since people don't konw what some secure jobs are in the modern city.
3.0	Iagree that it was easier to identidy what type of career would lead to a secure or successful future in the past.
5.0	Firstly, more than more robots start to work in th industry, which means there are an increasing number of work will be belong to robots.
8.0	It cause some people laid off.
8.0	When robots could finish works as well as people, boss might be bought mass robots.
8.0	And there are most mechine works will be done by robots instead of humans.
8.0	Although the price of robots is still tall, but robots can work all the time.
8.0	So if you didn't lost your job by robots, you would be find some job with special skills instead of tradtional careers.
5.0	Moreover, there are some messages offer more different works for people in the Internet.
8.0	It cause people meet more varied works when they prepare for find works.
8.0	Some career have happened in these years, and there are not common agreements of them.
8.0	There are some people support it and others have a negative to towards it.
8.0	When people meet mass careers, they need spend more time of find messages of them.
8.0	But we can find enough goods and bads of one job in the Internst, and it was not easier to identify whether one job would lead to a successful future with  a large of onforamations.
0.0	Finally, some successful works might be an ordinary career in the Internet time.
0.0	For example, there is a successful work in the past, like telephone officiers.
0.0	When the mobile phone happened, there are no people have this job.
0.0	Some technique might change the habitors of people and broyught some new products.
10.0	Maybe your job is a great career which brought popular products or something now with your special skills, but there are some products happened with more serves in the future.
7.0	Since there are a high seed of producting in the I
11.0	Nowadays,more and more pelple become to believe that we can learn a person by the films and books what this person like.
12.0	From my perspective,I agree this point and I believe that there is a strong relationship between the person and the favorit moives and books of him or her.
11.0	If you have some basic knowlage,you can learn abou a person in this way,this theory have more scientific support than you think.
5.0	Firstly,the lables and kinds of those books and films can show the hobbies and personalities of the person.
8.0	If someone like crime moives,he may like the chasing part of the films,in this way,he may be a brave guy.
8.0	Generally speaking,you can find some characteristics of the person by those point.
8.0	Books and films were sorted in the catelogry,so did the people.
8.0	You can learn about a people by what he favor by other's experiences or your own experiences.
8.0	For example,you can order a book about this online,this kind of book usually labled psycological analysis.
8.0	Those book summerised the common point of the person and listed out ther favor,you can check out more infomation in those book.
5.0	Secend,those books and films reflected their statues,educated level and spirit.
8.0	From many reserch,there is a common conclusion that the status and educated experiences have a great impact on their choice of books and moives.
8.0	This phenomenon was ascribed to the experiences and expecting of a person decide what he like.
8.0	There may be many examples,but here are the most significant issues.
8.0	One is the person was more educated,the more he would like detective novels and scientific moives,another one is that the higher statues the person in,the more literiture books he read.
10.0	Those two point both support
3.0	With the development of the society and the education, there are more and more people concerning about their children's education problems.
11.0	Some people may say that parents now are more involved in their kids' education than before.
11.0	However, others have opposite opinion that parents are not like the parents in the past involving in the children's education.
12.0	From my perspective, I think that the parents now are less involved in the children's education than were parents  before and I would like to illustrate my ideas in the followings.
4.0	First, parents are busy than the parents in the past so they have less time to participate in their children's deucation than the parents in the past.
8.0	Nowadays, it is usual that both father and mother go to work rather than one of the parents staying at home to take care of their kids.
8.0	For example, when I was in primary school, my mother did not work and she always taught me how to do my maths homework.
8.0	By contrast, my little sister now is in primary school and mother now has to go to work just as father, so she does not have enough to teach my sister.
8.0	Therefore, parents are less involved in children's education.
4.0	Furthermore, the education system is better than before so parents rely on the school's teacher rather than themselves to teach their children.
8.0	Because of the progress of the economy, school now have more ability to build up advanced facilitis and hire more intelligent teachers to attract parents and children.
8.0	If parents think the school can provide better education than they could do, they will be glad to send their children to school and concentrate on other tasks.
8.0	Consequently, during the education process, parents' interfere become less.
8.0	For instance, my friend Amy have a younger brother and this boy now study in a primary school that asks students live in dorms.
8.0	The boy can only go back to home on weekend and his study is all dependent on his teachers rather than his parents.
4.0	Admittedly, parents paly an important role in children's live especially in their study.
8.0	They can give some help on their kids' study.
8.0	On the contrary, children now are more independent than the children in the past, so parents' character is more like a mental support, such as giving ecouragement, rather than a teacher on their study.
8.0	Besides, the homework that children need to finish is much harder than before, so parents may not help their children as the parents in the past so parents have less effect on their children's study.
0.0	Since parents are more busy than before and the education system is better than before,  for parents they are more inclined to let their children study in the school.
0.0	By this way, it can also caltivate the ablility of independence for children,which is good for kids in their future.
0.0	Therefore, parents are less involved in their children's education than before.
3.0	Unlike older generation, students today become familiar with computer or Internet.
3.0	Advanced techonology such as smart phone is extremely popular among the students.
3.0	Controversy arises whenever students are selecting their own learning habits.
3.0	Some argue that doing other things impose bad effect on learning, while the reverse side advocate surfing the Internet or listening to music when thet are learning.
11.0	As far as I am concerned, just because the other things does not mean students' academic apperance will be influenced.
5.0	First and foremost, with that advent of Internet, students can acquire useful information conveniently.
8.0	Undeniablely, the adoption of Internet has remarkably raised the study productivity.
8.0	That is to say, with easy clicks of mouse, the striking speed of computers is vividly displayed.
8.0	For instance, my cousin Jackon who is a junior school student.
8.0	He is accustomed to surfing the internet when he does his homework.
8.0	With the help of Internet, his homework usually be praised on the grounds that it contains plenty of knowledge that cannot be acquired only from the classes.
8.0	Admittedly, Internet is one of the most important tools that education possesses.
8.0	The right implement of this tool is a great way of assuring the quality of study.
5.0	Additionally, listening to music plays an important role in making studying and reading time enjoyable.
10.0	According to a report from a major education website,
3.0	From my perspective, this is not a good ideal.
12.0	Although money could be a nice stimulus for children to get high grade in exams, it has nothing good for children to develop a healthy and correct attitude towards study.
11.0	Children might think that the sole advantage of study well is gaining more money.
11.0	Once they consider study as a tool to get money, it will bring a lot of negative effect.
5.0	Firstly, the child might be a excellent student in the beginning.
8.0	He does well in the class, attains high grade every time and get the money as rewards.
8.0	What if he disappoints himself and his parents for a single time?
8.0	He will lose his rewards which he is already get used to.
8.0	It means a great strike to the young child.
5.0	Secondly, if there is a child who is not a good student at all and never get high scores in the tests.
8.0	When his parents tell him to do well in school and come back to get money, what would he do in order to get the money?
8.0	Most probably he would cheat in the exam for high scores and get the money.
8.0	It can not help to build a correct attitude in study for the child but steer him to a fully incorrect way.
0.0	In my opinion, the parents need to find another way to encourage their children to behave well in school.
0.0	The stimulus could be a book, a chance to travel or something can attract the children's interest.
0.0	Attach study to money is absolutely not a wise decision.
0.0	In other words, if our children fail in such an exam, we should also encourage him to recover rapidly.
7.0	Life goes on and a single failure can represent nothing, he should struggle for his study because of his dream, not the money
3.0	Is it the best way to travel in a group with a tour guide?
3.0	Can we have a great time in a group travel?
3.0	As a amateur in travel, traveling in a group restricts my free and the satisfaction of the  travel.
11.0	As a result, from my perspective, the group travel is not a good choice.
5.0	On the one hand, the group travel restricts our free.
8.0	To be more specific, If we participate in a group travel, we will be restricted in a rigorous schedule that travel agency makes.
8.0	"Consider myself for instance, last year, I participated in a group travel that called ""7days travel in Hai Nan""."
8.0	However, although we went there with a good mood, we did not have a good time at that 7 days.
8.0	The first day we arrived there, and we felt extremely tired for the 5 hours riding in the high speed rail, but the guide also resisted to led us to visited a stone statue of Guanyin.
8.0	Dramastically, all of us just wanted to sleep or stroll nereby.
8.0	Finally, we still went to visited the Guanyin statues, but we felt boring and terrible.
8.0	Second day we even climbed mountains in a rainy day under the schedule.
8.0	Obviously, the compellent schedules do not benefit for us, the group travel is not a good choice.
5.0	On the other hand, the group travel is hazardous sometime.
8.0	To be more convincible, some of the small scales travel agency have some bad low-downs which are harmful for our porperty even the being.
8.0	For instance, these days a traveling group about 10 people in our country prepare to have a travel in Tailand.
8.0	However, they met a problem that the guides abused them and threaten them just since they did not consume enough money in a rubber market.
8.0	Finally, the 10 people escaped and leave Tailand, and the travel agancy has been complaints and be punish.
3.0	Parents always have different kinds of ideas to try to teach their childrens better.
12.0	Some of them think that parents should let chilren make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.
11.0	In my opinion,I don't thnk that is a good idea,I think to teach children directly is better,here are my reasons.
4.0	Firstly,it can make your children get it directly and exactly.
8.0	To let your children learn from their own mistake,they may not get the exactly point.
8.0	They might think they are wrong,but they may not know why,or ven don't think they are wrong.
8.0	By this,thy may make mistake again at the next time.
8.0	Also,in this way,you can not make sure that it got the point you want,that make it confuse.
8.0	will think about some other reason,that makes it confuse,In that case,to teach them directly may make them not do the wrong thing again,because thay will knoe that it wrong,so they will try to abvoid it.
4.0	Secondly,to let children learn from their own mistakes may waste your time or your power.
8.0	It may take a long time to let chilren learn fome their own mistakes.
8.0	And that really waste both your times.
8.0	To teach them directly,you can let them knowimmediatly,that you do not need to wait for a long time to let them get the point.
8.0	Also,waiting waste your power,you will always think about what is the best point to lead them to get your point,that really need a lot of time and powers.
8.0	Teaching them directly can make ypou don't need this kind of waste.
4.0	Thirdly,when you teach them directly,they can try it immediaty.
8.0	Because they know what things they did is wrong,they will try to do it correctly.
8.0	The more time they have to try it,the things they can do is better.
8.0	"Just ike""practice makes perfect""."
8.0	If you let them find it themselves,they might not have enough timed or enoiugh opportunities to correct it.
8.0	May be they are just get used to it at that time,they may regret,but they can'y change because mey be they are just get used to it.
8.0	By yhis,teach them dirctlky is really important.
2.0	In conclusion,I do not agree with the following statement,bcause I think to teach them directly can make them get your points directly and exactly,it will not let you waste your time and power on waiting for them,and it can give them enough time to fix their mistakes to become better.
3.0	Recently , a significant number of families  have the ability to let their children to receive high-quality education because a wide variety of parents hope their children can get good grades in the future.
3.0	During this special period, some parents suggest that they can use money to make their kids to study arduously.
11.0	In my opinion, I agree with this statement,too.
4.0	Admittedly, using this extreme methods may confuse childen about recognition of  study's meaning.
8.0	Because some chilren are too young to understand how hard their parents need to make money.
8.0	This method may cultivate a bad habit to children that ignore the meaning of study.
8.0	However, in the fast-paced society, many chilren are not too naive as we imagined.
8.0	They have the ability to develop their own idea.
8.0	What's more, the development of chilren is related to how parents act in front of children.
8.0	If parents use the methods reasonably and educate their chilren well.
8.0	it actually will bring benefits to children.
4.0	Moreover, using money for reward can motivate children to study hard.
8.0	That is becasue, children studying in school just like employees working in company.
8.0	If a company can give employees some motivations and bonus, I think the employees  will work more efficient.
8.0	Therefore, if parents can facilitate their children to study by rewarding, they will not lose the interests to study and know why they need to work hard.
8.0	Take my own experience as examples, my mom always use this method to stimulate me to keep studying when I feel bored at goin to school.
8.0	The reason why I study hard is that I derive happiness from reward then I can purchase something fun, and others student do not want to study because they derive happiness from playing with friends during their spare time.
4.0	Last but not least,  rewarding can make children realize the importance of money.
8.0	For example, before going to the university, it is unnecessary for students to take the part-time job.
8.0	Therefore, students do not possess the ability to make money.
8.0	However, rewarding can help students to realize how their parents use their sweat and strength to make money, which is similar for students to study hard in school because both  of schools and companies have competitions.
2.0	In conclusion,  I think it is a good idea that parents provide their children money for each high grade they get in school, due to the effieciency , motivation of study and right recognition of money.
3.0	Recently a discussion over whether awarding kids with money for each high mark is appropriate has aroused people's attention.
3.0	I think awarding kids for grades is something that can benefit both the kids and the parents.
11.0	My reasons are as follows.
5.0	Firstly,offering school-age children money for high marks can make students get better grades.
8.0	Because money awarded means children benefit more from studing hard.
8.0	And more benefits means the kids are much more motivated,which will lead them to study harder and get better grades.
8.0	Better-grade school-age children can attract more attention from  the teacher and  fellow classmates,which is a good outcome.
8.0	When I was young,I didn't do well in my study at first.
8.0	Kids in my school  only hung out with good students and barely noticed me.
8.0	Teachers only like kids that can get good grades,they praised them and answered their questions with more patience which I cannot experience.
8.0	This has made me feel really bad and lonely in a long time until my grades get better because my parents decided to offer me 20 dollars for each high scores ,I get encouraged ,study really hard and eventually end up being a good student.
5.0	Secondly, awarding kids money can make parents happier.
8.0	On the one hand,if they give kids money for studying well,then their children can study harder andbetter in the future,as I have explained in the last paragraph.
8.0	This can save parents' worries that their children may not have the self-control to study hard enough.
8.0	On the other hand,when kids can study well on their own,parents can save the money for extra classes after school,and that will save quite enough money for awards.
8.0	Parents will feel less stressed working hard to earn the money for extra classes and will be happier.
8.0	I didn't attend any extra classes because I can study well on my own,this has made my parents feel quite proud and relaxed for this lessen their burden for money-making.
0.0	In conclusion,I think awarding kids money for high grade is a good idea that benefits both the kids and the parents.
0.0	Kids get better grades,the money , more attention and they are happier.
0.0	Parents are more relaxed because they don't need to worry about kids' study or money-making.
3.0	Is it better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise?
4.0	Actually I'm not a supporter of this statement.
10.0	Since we want relax ourselves on our available time,watching a movie or doing physical exercise are both a good choice as long as you can relieve your stress.
4.0	For some people,when they are wathcing on a movie or reading a book,they put themselves in the world which the author creates.
8.0	In that world ,they forget the annoyance in their life and immersing in the fictonal world.
8.0	When they finish the movie or the book ,they may have a new standing the life and get the motivation to start their job.
8.0	For example,once I was disappointed by the hard course I take and felt like doing nothing on that day,so I chose to give me a break to watch a movie.
8.0	I found a movie named Whiplash which talks about a boy who is not so talented druming but met an extremely strict teacher.
8.0	During the training time he tried to give up and finally he successed,although he lost  his loved girlfriend.
8.0	After finishing this movie I was not so annoyed because I found that nothing is easy and you can choose to give up or keep going.
8.0	I realized I shouldn't be defeated by the course and felt more relaxed before the break.
4.0	However,some people are different.
8.0	Simply sitting down and watch a movie cannont relieve the stress they accumulate.
8.0	They need a more powerful way to relax themselves,so they choose to do some physical exercise.
8.0	When they are running,boxing,doing weight lifting,they can calm down and clean up their mind.
8.0	One of my friend,Sandy,everytime she needs to relax herself,she chooses to go to the gym and exercises for about two hours.
7.0	She told me that only through this way she can relax
3.0	With the development of economy,people become richer and richer.
3.0	We have never worried about we have nothing to eat or nothing to drink.
3.0	But there are also many strangers that they are struggling in survival.
11.0	If you ask me if people today are more willing to help the struggling strangers,i think the anser is yes.
6.0	Since ancient china,people always advocating 'to help others,and you will also be happy'.
8.0	I think this kind of view must have profound influence on us.
8.0	What's more,people's education background is in a high level rather than previous time,which means they have higher morality in another hands.
8.0	Besides,the appearance of telephone and internet make us surff the imformation and communicate with others conveniently.
8.0	You can know who need to be help from the internet and help him just through an application.
2.0	As we all know,there are many famous peope that they denote a large number of money in helping poor people each year.
7.0	Take me as an example,  To sum up,if
12.0	There is an old saying  in China goes that ” If the person do not listen and follow the old man' words, he will gat bad results.“
12.0	The truth will not change as the time is fleeting.
11.0	Thus, it is true that grandparents can give their grandchildren useful advice.
4.0	Grandparents are full of experirence, so they have a lot positive oand negative examples for their grandchildren.
8.0	I remember when I was a child, my grandmother told me that do not eat a lot candy and cakes, but I took this advice as the litter in the ground and still followed my own rules.
8.0	Then when I was growing up, I finally understood the suggestion from my grandmother beacause of my toothache.
8.0	The time can test the golden rock , therefore the grandparents obviously have enough experience to teach their children something.
4.0	Grandparents can give their grandchildren positive valus and encouragements toward the life and future.
8.0	Many thoughts and valuses will not change because of the progress of the society, they stil can influence the next generation.
8.0	Nowadays, nearly everyone such as the laptop and smart phones.
8.0	However, the elder are eager to let the children read more bool raher than playing with varous electric devices
4.0	Admittedly, the world did change a lot in the last 50 years; therefore, it is hard for most of our grandparents to catch up with the cutting-edge technology.
9.0	For example, some of our grandparent may regard surfng the internet as a bad conduct.
9.0	Apparently, the grandparents may not update their information in their minds, but it is true that the diverse electrical life can ruin a youngster' life, because young people can be easily addicted to the unreal life in the computer games.
10.0	Grandparent can be the guides of young
3.0	Nobody can ensure that they would never make any mistakes in their life.
3.0	So does the teacher.
3.0	However, the teacher need to face a more stricter problem: what would happen if teacher has made mistakes when they are teaching the student, and what should students perform when they have noticed that?
12.0	Different people have different views.
11.0	Some people think they should show respect and say nothing.
12.0	And some people choose to interrupt and correct the mistaks immediately.
10.0	In my opinion, the better option is to wait until the ending of the class, and then talk to the teacher privately.
5.0	To begin with, if students interrupt the teacher right away and point the mistakes during the class, it would embarrass the teacher, and it is not polite.
8.0	My friend Joe had met this kind of problems and did exactly this way.
8.0	and thus he was got in some trouble.
8.0	Joe is the person who cannot tolerate any mistakes, so he corrected the mistake made by our teacher when we still during in a class.
8.0	And then the teacher felt angry because of the interrupt.
8.0	The teacher used to disgusted with the situation when her classes are being disturbed.
8.0	So the teacher criticized Joe and asked him to write a criticism text.
8.0	It is impolite that disturb others while they are contrating on themselves.
5.0	Furthermore, when people noticed the impolite behavior, they will choose to say nothing.
9.0	In my opinion, the selection is even worse than the first choice.
9.0	If the teacher does not relize the mistake, they would teach the wrong knowledge in the future teaching thus to mislead more students.
1.0	Finally, the best choice is to wait for the end of class and talk to the teacher in private.
1.0	So the teacher would not feel embarrassed and would correct the mistake next time.
3.0	In the fast-pace life style society, different jobs require different skills, even though in one kind of work, various types of work should be done, abilities to handle a large sum of work are needed.
12.0	Workers can bet more satisfaction from this type of working style.
5.0	Compared with dealing with similiar works day by day in which almost every employee will feel tedious and boring, a job involved different work contents is more appealing.
8.0	By accepting different requirements, just as every day is brand new.
8.0	Worker can welcome each fresh morning and get refreshed.
8.0	In this case, we can be energetic to carry out our work.
8.0	It is reported that doing the same work for 3 monthes will reduce the work efficiency by 20 percent.
5.0	In addition, different tasks stimulate the work passion of our staffs.
8.0	As a person has achieved great in his own field, if there is no other challenges for him, he may become an ego-centralized person.
8.0	However, with other task requirements, he can overcome himself through finishing tasks one and another.
8.0	For example, there are many opportunities in my friend's work.
8.0	He works in a training school, what he should do in his work is not only limited teaching those students, but also solving the question and complaints from thier parents.
8.0	Sometimes, it is maybe exhausted to handling those tasks at a time, through which his ability to deal with things gets improved.
8.0	In this kind of work, what he earn is the sense of achievement to a large degree.
7.0	In conclusion, different work requirements can provide stimulation and passion for those workers and enable them to achieve a lot, which is a self-satified task
12.0	I agree with this opinion, because lies can destory a beautiful relationship, honesty is benefit for the development for our society and telling the truth can improve ourselves, so now I will explain why i think that First, telling truth can maintain the connection between peole well.
8.0	For example, one day, our school held a dance metting and students and teachers are required to attend this meeting.
8.0	The day before yesterday, I choose clothes with my best friends, and she matched a serious of clothes and told me whether this clothes is beautiful or not.
8.0	To be honest, I think her matched very terrible, but I afraid of if i tell the truth to her, she will angry about me, so I lie to her.
8.0	When we attended the meeting, everyone laugh ar my best friends, and my friends geted hurts and ask me why I did not thelll her truth, but I did not know how to eaplain the reason.
8.0	So after that the relationship between us become badly.
8.0	So through this thing, I understand the relationship is based on truth.
6.0	Second, honest is very important between the patients and doctors too.
8.0	Imagination, if a patient has cancer, in that case, doctors should tell the truth to the patients and their faimily and provide a useful solution instead of lying.
8.0	If the doctor does not telll the truth to the patience and want to use this chance to get a lot of money, it will cause the patience to dead and the fame of hospital and doctors will be destoried .
8.0	However, if the doctor tells the truth to the patience, it can save a life, and the relationship between doctors and people will become better and better.
1.0	Third, telling truth also is important for a couple.
1.0	If your husband and wife always lies to you, and you still trust them , when the lies break, you will be hurt.
10.0	For instane, a boy who is poor but he fall in love with a pretty girl, he knows the girl would not marry with a poor man, so he hires a car and house to prove he is rich, and the girl belive his lie.
7.0	One day, the girl found the truth and she is very sad, so th
3.0	Some people thinks that now young people are more like to give a hand to others than those in the past.
12.0	However, I hold an opposite view.
12.0	When people talk about the compare of young people's goodness between currant and previous, I totally agree that young people today prefer to help others.
12.0	My reason list below, now young people have more surplus money to donate for others, and now the society pay more attention to the education of contribution.
6.0	To begin with,people are more willing to help others when they have more extra money.
9.0	In the past, people even can not make a living and they can not guarantee their own living so that they will not concentrate on others' situation.
9.0	In today's world, the economy level has increased and people possess more surplus money, therefore, people begin to think about the donation and they are more like to contribute because now this thing will not affect their own life.
2.0	In addition, the country put a greater emphasis on the promote of help.
10.0	In our daily,
11.0	I DISAGREE THIS STATEMENT.
12.0	AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED, I THINK PEOPLE NOWADAYS ARE MORE UNWILLING TO HELP STRUGGLING SATRANGERS.
5.0	FIRST, MANY PEOPLE NOW ARE MORE COLD AND SELFISH.
8.0	THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE ORTHER PEOPLE.
8.0	THERE ARE SO MANY FIERCE COMPETITION IN SOCIETY, HIGH PRESSURE MAKES PEOPLE UNWILLING TO HELP OTHERS WITHOUT ANY RETURN.
8.0	WHAT'S MORE, THEY SELDOM PAY ATTENTION TO THE PROBLEMS OF THEIR FAMILIAR PEOPLE, SO IT WILL BE LESS PROBABLY FOR THEM TO HELP STRUGGLING STRANGERS.
5.0	SECOND,STRUGGLING PEOPLE ARE NOT EASY TO GET THE BELIEF AND SYMPATHY TODAY.
8.0	AS WE KNOW, THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE BLACKMAIL OTHERS TO EARN MONEY.
8.0	THEY ACT AS A PATIENT OR BE HURT BY CARS, WHEN YOU GET CLOSE TO THEM, THEY WILLFIND FAULT WITH YOU.
8.0	IN THIS WAY, PEOPLE RAISE THEIR VIGILANCE, AND SELDOM HELP THE STUGGLING STRANGERS WITH WITNESS OR OTHER EVIDENCE.
8.0	IN CHINA, A INCIDENT CALLED XIAOYUEYUE IS VERY FAMOUS.
8.0	A LITTLE GIRL LAY DOWN THE FLOOR WITH SERIOUS ILLNES.
8.0	THERE ARE SO MANY PASSERS-BY WHILE NO ONE STOP TO HELP HER IN HALF AN HOUR.
8.0	AS A CONSEQUENCE, THE LITTLE GIRL WAS DEAD.
8.0	PEOPLE CAN'T MAKE SURE WHETHER THE GIRL IS IN DANGER OR NOT, SO THEY DON'T WANT TO SHOW THIER SYPATHY.
1.0	IT IS A CRUEL BUT REAL STORY.
1.0	PEOPLE NOW ARE MORE UNWILLING TO HELLP THE STRUGGLING STRANGERS.
3.0	With the regulation pointed out in my country that every family could only have a kid, nearly every children has no siblings and consequently parents treat their only children as vulnerable galss and keep them from making mistakes.
3.0	But as a matter of fact, children can not grow up healthily both in mental and in physical.
12.0	So, parents should allow children to make mistakes and deal with them by themselves.
5.0	To start with it, children are able to become independent and strong enough without parents' help and assistance.
8.0	Since parents can not be there for us to help us solve every problem we encounter, allowing children to make mistakes and learn from their own mistakes gives children valuable chances to become stronger,braver and more independent than other peers, thus making them more adpatable to the real society.
8.0	On the contrary, if parents always pretend their children from making mistakes, children would never know what is wrong and how to fix it.
8.0	When they do face such troubles and parents can not help them , they will be beaten by themselves.
5.0	Futhermore, experience learned from mistakes and failure is critical basis of success.
8.0	We konw that a lot of successful businessmen succeed after failing many times.
8.0	Edison had failed hundreds of times succeed in invented the bulb.
8.0	Gou Jian had become a prisoner before he united the state.
8.0	Success never occur to person who have not courage and cannot persist.
8.0	Only those who dear to face their problems directly and try hard to figure them out will gain pricelesss experience from failyre and achieve success.
0.0	As I illustrate above, parents should allow children to make mistakes and learn from it.
0.0	Because by doing it, they enable their children to become strong and independent quickly and chieve success.
0.0	Also, such experience can bring them a lot in their life span.
3.0	There are a lot of way for teachers to teaching in order to make the students more fulfilling and high-knowledged.
3.0	Some tasks made by teachers are aimed at group working while others are asked to be finished by students themselves.
11.0	There is an argument that working together is more effectively than working alone, and as for me, I agree with that.
4.0	Admittedly, working independently offers students the chance to learn to think things out for themselves and matchs more on the exams in schools.
10.0	But students will be not concentrating on their work if there are something more interesting, and also they will not have the competitive consiousness as they have no idea about other students processes of accomplishment.
4.0	To begin with, group works offers a chance for students to gain some experience and skills from others and solve their problems in time.
8.0	Group members are all individuals.
8.0	they have different ideas or perspective even on the same thing and thus finish the task more quickly.
8.0	Take myself for example, last year when I had a group assignment with my classmates, I really benefited a lot from that.
8.0	After the discusion, we searched for some essays and information and then shared together.
8.0	It saved me a lot of time because I could gain some ideas from others.
8.0	I still remember that I was got into a huge trouble when I did my part of the project, luckily, they helped me to figure out the question and solve it.
8.0	I could not imagine that if I can finish the task on time without them.
4.0	Furthermore, others can be a motivation and inspiration for students if they feel tired in their work or study.
8.0	Since there are not anyone here to supervise if students working alone and they will be tired and even give up in the half way.
8.0	A survey made by the National Educational Commitee did a investigation among students last year, they assigned the same tasks for each student but some were asked to work together while some were alone.
8.0	Then the researchers did some interfere to them such as broadcasted some music or talk around when students were learning.
8.0	The results showed that students in groups would be interfered by the environment less than the students worked alone.
8.0	Probably due to the reason that other members in the group will do some vital catalytic roles on others.
1.0	To sum up, students do work more effectively in groups rather than work alone.
1.0	Not only because of the information or ideas  they are willing to get, but also due to their concentrations in study.
3.0	As we all know, it is important to find the direction of  the future.
3.0	The dreams, the goals can tell people what the direction is and people will have a bright future when they achieve the dreams or the goals.
3.0	But the question is, what is the better way to achieve these dreams?
11.0	For me, I prefer to focus on achieving the realistic goals rather than to follow the dreams even if the dreams are ambitious.
5.0	First, focusing on the realistic goals would not waste the time and the money, which is precious for the young people.
8.0	When we try to achieve the goals or the dream, we have to spend our time and money to be succesful.
8.0	But if the people's dream is not practical, which means that they can hardly achieve it, they would waste their time and money to fail.
8.0	For example, my brother liked to play the soccer when he was a child, so it was his dream to be a professional soccer player in the future.
8.0	So he decided to train with the school soccer team everyday and his parents spent a lot of money to employ the private coach to train him.
8.0	But he was not tallent in soccer, in fact, he was too weak to join the competition, and he had some illness innate.
8.0	Eventually, he achieved nothing when he was twenty-five years old, although he spent his whole youth and lots of money.
5.0	Second, focusing on realistic goals will motivate people to work hard and help people succeed finally.
8.0	The goals can actually make people know the direction about their future, and when they work hard to achieve all the realistic goals, they will finally be successful.
8.0	As we know, the realistic goals is easier to achieve by contrast and people always tend to be motivated when they achieve one goal.
8.0	So if people focus on achieving the realistic goals, they would be motivated by achieving one goal and try their best to achieve another one, and fianlly, the would be what they dream to be.
8.0	When my mother was a child, it was her dream to become a scientist.
8.0	But what she tried to achieve is not to be a professer in the university, but how to have a good grade to go to the best school.
8.0	Everytime she performed well in an exam, she was motivated to work hard to have a better grade in the next exam, and finally, she succeed to become a physical scientist.
2.0	So as I have said, focusing on the realistic is better than following the ambitious dreams.
3.0	It is a fairly common phenomenon nowadays that some parent will offer their children money if they get high grade at school, and there is a heated discussion about it.
12.0	From my perspective, if the amount of the money and the way parents deal with it is reasonably prepared, it will be a good idea to do this.
5.0	On the one hand, every child needs encouragement, especially when they are doing well.
8.0	We've heard so many times that a school-age child got to a higher grade after his\her parents' praise, either physically or mentally.
8.0	Furthurmore, there is a psychological theory called 'encouraging pattern'  which demostrates that appealing encouragement can have a much better effect than an ordinary one.
8.0	Money, with no doubt, is such a kind of fascinating gift from a parent to a child.
8.0	With a reasonable amount of money, the child can get considerably inspired and do even better in the next exam.
5.0	On the other hand, money shouldn't be always regarded as something that is bad for the children.
8.0	If properly used, money can be also beneficial to the children's life.
8.0	A recent research shows that people who had pocket money during childhood can arrange their personal finance better than those who had not.
8.0	This means that a moderate amount of money may be an opportunity for the kids to learn how to make use of it.
8.0	In other words, after the children gain something with their own intelligence, they are actually starting a new lesson, which is also essential for their personal development.
0.0	As a consequense, giving the money is not a thing that parents are not allowed to do, it just requires them to take more responsibilities and be more careful during their children's growth.
0.0	Whoever has done a good job deserve to be awarded and encouraged, no matter he is an adult or a child.
0.0	Giving children money for their good grades, if sophisticatedly planned by the parents, can be not only an encouraging tool, but also an educational one.
0.0	That's the reason I strongly approve this parental behaviour.
3.0	Reading books is an important way to gain knowledge.
3.0	A book depicts a person's life allows us to know the man better.
11.0	Films can also give us a picture about what a person is like.
12.0	However, do the books and films tell us everything about a person?
11.0	As far as I am concerned, we can not know exactly what a person like through books and films.
4.0	The aim of most books and films is to purvey possitive things and aspiration to the audiences, so they only depict the good time of one person or make great efforts to bueatify them.
8.0	The main character in films are always encouraging and do the best thing, and seldom make mistakes.
8.0	However, it is not true, we all make mistakes and such mistakes are the key to understand one person.
8.0	In the films, the directors delete the faults made by a specific person and thus make the impression unreliable.
4.0	All the films and the books is persueing a sense of drama, becuase it can stimulate the readers' or the audiences' interest and make them continue to admire the work.
9.0	In order to acheive this goal, the writer of the books or the films will make up the plot in which funny conversations or conflicting relationships will occur.
9.0	However, such conversations and relationships are unreal and will mislead the readers to attach a characteritic which is not belonged to the person in reality to this person in their minds.
4.0	Since the content of books and films is limited, we can only get one aspect of the person.
9.0	In many films, they only pay attention to the most eye-catching aspect of a person and only choose to depict events in which this aspect is showed.
9.0	Nontheless, every person is complexed and convoluted, so to understand a peoson fully, you should not only notice one aspect.
1.0	Taking into account of all the facts above, to learn about a person, reading books and watching films are not enough.
1.0	We should gather as many informations as possible in variety ways in order to build up a whole picture of a person.
3.0	Recently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people: whether your job has more effect on your happiness than social life does?
3.0	Some claim that social life can create more happiness.
11.0	However, contrary to their view comes my perspective that job has more effect on people's happiness.
6.0	To begin with, people spend more time on job than on social life.
8.0	To be more specific, people always need to work eight hours per day but they just spend two or even one hour on their social life.
8.0	If people do not like their job, they will be unhappy since they need to do something they do not really like and repeat it every day.
8.0	However, if people meet some trouble on social life, they might just forget it few days later.
8.0	For example, my uncle Wang, was a teacher when he was young.
8.0	But he did not like to teach others since he did not have much patient.
8.0	At that time, he was unhappy and became passive.
8.0	Then he changed his job, he became a business man and sooner made a lot of money.
8.0	He became positive and smile every day.
8.0	He always told me that people must choose a suitable job that make them happy since they have to spend most of their time on it.
2.0	To be followed, job can bring people a great sense of achievement when they succeed.
8.0	To illustrate, if peope finish their job very well, they will be praised by the boss and colleague which will give them a sense of satisfaction.
8.0	What' more, people can achieve their dream if they work hard on their job.
8.0	However, social life cannot give people those satisfaction.
8.0	For instance, my mother worked very hard, spending 10 hours on working and she barely have time to take part in some social activities.
8.0	But she is still happy and positive since she is always praised by her boss and her promotion is very fast.
8.0	So she does not need social life to cheer her up.
12.0	There is a dissused fiercely statement that if parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.
12.0	So I'd like to share my oppinions on it with you.
4.0	In some parents' view,it‘s excllent for their children to do good performances and not to make mistakes.
8.0	For others,they think making mistakes is not a matter of importance.
8.0	It's undoubtedly knowledged that everyone will make mistakes.
8.0	So why not let our children make mistakes?
4.0	As far as I'm concerned,makeing mistakes maybe does good to the children.
8.0	They have to reflect which steo is mistaken and why this is wrong when they find their mistakes.
8.0	By doing this,children will take hold a habit of reflecting and exploring.
8.0	Apart from this,it's also a good way to cultivate our children to make more friends and fit in the society more easily.
8.0	If the children's friends make mistake,they also forgive their friends as what they are treated because what matters is not to blame others but to find the solutions to the problems and forgive others.
4.0	I also want illustrate myself as an example to stress my oppinion.
8.0	In my childhood,I often made some foolish mistakes to anony my parents.
8.0	But my parents didn't beat me but express resons and    told me not to make one more time.
8.0	What impressed me most is that Idestroyed the toy of my sister's.
8.0	That's her favorite one presnted by our brother as a birthday gift.
8.0	I was afraid to face my sister and my sister also was not willing to talk to me.
8.0	That bad situation kept serval days.
8.0	Eventually,my parents took me to my anut to beg for my sister's forgive with any blame.
8.0	And my sister also apologied to me for not talking to me.
8.0	After that,we are good sisters and don not argue.
1.0	This is what I want to say.
1.0	Allowing children to make mistakes is good.
3.0	Nowadays, many people have much stress and pressure from their work, they usually have to stay up late to finish their work.
3.0	However, altought they are trying their best for their work, only a few of them can be successful.
12.0	I believe that in the past it was easier to identify what type of career or job would lead a secure and successful life.
4.0	First, one of the reason that i state is that, people can inherit his father's job in the past.
8.0	If your father is sonebody, you can be a successful peron like your father.
8.0	For example, the emperor in Chinese history always let their the most smart children to be a next emperor, therefore, it canbe secure and succesful.
8.0	And the other children can also be a important people in this country.
8.0	In this way, people can easy to identity this job is easy to get and it can lead a secure, successful future.
4.0	Secondly, many young people that they just guaruate from school is very difficult to identify which job can lead a successful future,and which job is not suitable for them.
8.0	They just guaduate from the university, and they have no experience to choose a job.
8.0	Nowadays, many young people are go to a different place for study, and sometimes cannot ask their parents for help.
8.0	They are too younf to be able to judge whether this job can lead a good future.
8.0	But in the past, the ancient people always stay with their parent for their whole life, they parent can point out wich job is great and suitable for them.
4.0	Finally, today's job make people have too many stress and presure, people are too tried after working.
9.0	Although they are hard-working, they sometime cannot be successful because there are too many people are smarter compete with them.
9.0	Therefore, maybe this job is great, it is difficult to be promoted, and it is hard to have a secure and successul future.
2.0	All in all, i state that it is more difficult to identify what type of job would lead to a sucure, successful future.
12.0	In my opinion, most advertisements make products seem much better then they really are, because the advertisement use hyperbole, super star to propagandize their products and in propose to hide the disadvantage of their products.
4.0	Firstly, the merchants usullay advertise their products by hyperbole.
8.0	Which means the merchants always exaggrate the advantage of their product.
8.0	For example, some merchants want to show their sport drinking can help people refresh theirselves, then in their advertisements, the  customer can fly in the sky after drinking their sport drinking.
8.0	As we know, the sport drinking is not able to make people fly in the sky.
8.0	Merchants use hyperbole to exaggrate their product, which is order to attract customer to buy their product.
4.0	Second, the company usullay let some famous people to advertise their products.
8.0	The super star always can attract their fans.
8.0	The fans only pay attantion on their idol, then ignore the shortage of the products.
8.0	For example, a famous singer advertise one company's new cloth.
8.0	When he take this cloth and walk in the street,his fans see he wear this kind of cloth, then all of his fans want the same clothes with their idol.
8.0	The fans only care their idol, not the quality of the clothes.
8.0	No matter how bad the quality is, the fans still will buy the same clother as their idol.
4.0	Finally, the seller will hide the disadvantage of their product in their advertisement.
8.0	The merchant will only demonstrate  the advantage of their products, they wound not show the shortage.
8.0	For example, a company want to sell their cellphones, in the advertisement they only show their cellphone is good at  taking picture and make the picture in high quality.
8.0	But they will not show their cellphone can not recieve the massage from other.
8.0	This will mislead the customer and reduce the information which customer can get, then attract customer to buy it.
2.0	In conclusion, most advertisements make products seem much better then they really are, because the advertisement use hyperbole, super star to propagandize their products and in propose to hide the disadvantage of their products.
3.0	In real life, it is ineluctable that the child take a mistake.
12.0	this is not serious, because everyone take a mistake.
12.0	it is important that his parents should how correct his behavior.
12.0	Someone think that we should ask them learn from own mistake.
9.0	Other does not think so.
9.0	I support the former.
6.0	The parents must correct child's mistake with all their strength.
8.0	First,  if parents do not stop his behavior, he thinks he's behavior is right.
8.0	He could do this things everyday, with the march of time, he could enjoy do this things.
8.0	So, this mistake could accompany his life.
8.0	this may lead to his job and healthy.
8.0	For example, I listen to a story, a boy steal a other's fruit when he is young.
8.0	His parents stop him and smile to him.
8.0	So, the boy start steal   more things in many people's house.
8.0	Fianlly, he became a crimin.
8.0	Up to now, he is in the prison.
8.0	A famors people say that someone steal a small things when someone was young, someone steal bigger shings when he was adult.
11.0	In my opinion, i agree with this statement.
11.0	Parents' education is very important for children.
12.0	Their thoughts and their behavior will effect their children's life.
12.0	But the point is, parents can't live and tell what to do forever, their life will end in oneday.
11.0	Their children have to be prepared for it.
12.0	There're some reasons for my thoughts on it.
5.0	Every parents want their children to be sucessful in the future.
8.0	So they want their children to listen their words and morals, they wish them not to make the same mistakes like themselves.
8.0	On the way to success, you will meet the difficulties, so children need to think by themselves, not to think through their parents.
8.0	In our life, we will have hundreds or even thousands of problems.
8.0	It starts from our school buisness, at that time you can ask help from your dear parents but later on, you should realize you already grow-up, you need to think and act like a grown-up.
8.0	At that time, no one will help you anymore.
8.0	You will fail again and again but finally you will win, just like other famous people.
8.0	Later on, when you face to face with one big problem that might change your whole life, you will realize how important that your experiences are.
8.0	They will be thankful to their parents that they give them a super good way to study and learn.
8.0	All their success are origin from their hard working and the mistakes that they've been made.
5.0	"On the other side, if parents are acting like the ""Snowplow parents"", that's a recently popular kinds of parents."
8.0	They will help their children clear all the obstacles in his life, and protect him very well, just like a huge baby.
8.0	Their over love might ruin their children.
8.0	Oneday, their children will have nothing, no good career, no job, no happy life.
8.0	They have nothing to do in this society, like a rubbish.
8.0	All the reasons that lead to this is their parents' education.
8.0	And after they grow-up, they will even use their parents money to keep living.
0.0	So, in a nutshell, I totally agree with this statement.
0.0	Parents don't need to put all their attention on their children, they can have their own life.
0.0	They only need to tell them how to do at the beginning, then just let them go, just do it by themselves, trust them that they can be awesome without your help.
3.0	Nowadays, students are faced with increasing pressure from their parents, who expect them to do well in the study so that they will be able to get a decent job in the future.
3.0	In this situation, how to get enough rest during the spare time has become a significant problem for students.
11.0	Some people contends that watchin a movie or reading a book is better than doing physical exercise.
11.0	However i disagree with that for following reasons.
5.0	First of all, compared to the former choice, doing physical exercise help students keep fit and healthy.
8.0	The physiacl exercise strenghthen students' immune system, which will reduce the chance to get sick.
8.0	I used to sit in the classroom after class when i was 10.
8.0	At that time i seldom did sports and i frequently get ill.
8.0	However, after my math teachers required us to go outside the classroom during the break between the classes, i felt good.
8.0	Gradually, i became healthier and did better in my P.E class.
5.0	On top of that, doing physical exercise needs less thinking than reading, which provides more rest for brain.
8.0	Students often feel exhausted after class because they lose lots of energy thinking during the class.
8.0	So what they need during the break is rest for their brains.
8.0	Doing physical exercise let them relax without thinking hard.
8.0	When i felt tired in studying, i always go out palying football with my friends.
8.0	During the game, i forget about the pressure from the study.
8.0	After the game, my mind is ready for studying again.
7.0	There are people say that doing physical exercise make students feel more tired, not more relaxed, However, if we do not go to one extreme to the other, we can
3.0	Parents should  let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.
4.0	the growth of a child is a complicated process,a lot of unexpeted things is waiting for them.
10.0	of cource they will make
4.0	mistakes during their growth.
10.0	My opnion is that they will learn from their mistakes because human beings have the nature
10.0	to conclude from their mistakes on the purpose of processing a better understanding of the world .
4.0	So dont worry,their will learn.
10.0	Instead,sometimes the presurrefrom thei parents is why the children feel hard to solve the
10.0	problems.
10.0	Tke myself as a example,when I was a little child ,once I accidentally fought with a boy and I hit his head,my mom didnt
4.0	gave me too much pressure.
10.0	Instead,she askede me to stand by the wall to learn what I should do as a goodgirl .
2.0	Education on a child doesnt depend on the criticizition ,it is a process must be feeled by the children themselves.
8.0	People are busy with their work now, so they will try many ways  to relax themselves during the holiday,such as doing sports, watching movies and going shorpping.
8.0	Some people choose travle and they believes it is best to have a guide on the package tour.
8.0	However, I don't think it's the best way to travle with a tour guide, beause join in the tourist group is not free.
6.0	First of all,  if people traveling in the groupe and have a toure guide, everyone have to listen to the tour guide for all the arrangement.
8.0	The tour guide will arrange the time to get up and even arrive at the place we want to visit, so people will only have a little time for themselves.
8.0	On the other hand,  if people don't join the tour group, time will become more abundant.
8.0	For example, I used to travel in a group and have a toure guide.
8.0	But I travel with my best friend last summer vacation without tour guide.
8.0	My friend and I don't have to get up early.
8.0	We walked around the hotel and buy some local food for breakfast.
8.0	Then we choose to go to the famuse building which near the hotel by bike, so that we can not only enjoy the view along the way but also relax.
12.0	It has been highly discussed that employees should be given tasks to do according to their type of work.
11.0	Some people contned that they are more likely to be arranged to complete sorts of tasks because it is more inersting and useful.
12.0	However, other workers hold the view that they prefer similar tasks in a day for the reason that they are more familiar with it and accomplish it more efficiently.
12.0	From my perspective,multi-tasks can really fulfill people's mind and push them forward.
5.0	There is no denying that doing different tasks can excite people and make them interested in the task.
8.0	When people are addicted to their work,it is easy for them to get bored of the work and give up the career.
8.0	But different kinds of tasks can enrich the life of the work.
8.0	Take the work of the teacher for example,they handle different classes and students all day long,if they are not given other assignments,such as seminar and students' activities,they will be easily tired of their teaching.
8.0	Seminar and activities are like a kind of integredient in the food,and it can bring different flavors to the teachers.
8.0	Therefore,different types of tasks can make the work colorful and interesting.
5.0	What's more,completing various tasks can enhance the staff's comprensive skills,which is benefit in the career and life.
8.0	Fishing a task in a day and repeating it is simple for the workers,but it is difficult to accomplish various tasks in a day.
8.0	Under that circumsatnce, the workers may have the pressure to improve themselves and become better.
8.0	Especially for the workers who get good results in a complicate task,they will feel more confident,Thus,they wiil like their work more.
8.0	G radually,they will spare no efforts to learn more from others and work,benefiting their whole life.
1.0	In conclusion,only by doing different kinds of tasks can the workers get more satisfication from the work.
1.0	Last but not the least,the workers may improve themselves through the work.
12.0	Currently, a controversial topic has aroused heated debated in the society: being creative or making careful plan, which  is the best solution for a problem.
11.0	Some people think they can solve all the problems by making plan and work step by step.
11.0	However, in my opinion, being creative can help us to find the best solution.
11.0	My point can be elaborated as follows.
5.0	First of all,  be creative can help us to deal with unfamiliar situation and emergencies, which are hard to make plan in advance.
8.0	It is easy to make plan for conventional problem, since there are fixed solution for them.
8.0	However, for unfamiliar situation or emergencies, we don't have the experience to deal with them.
8.0	In this way, even though we try to make plan, we will find that there are too much unknown information so that we cannot decide what to do in advance.
8.0	We have to be creative and come up with solution when the unexpected situation occurs.
8.0	For example, when I first become the leader of the physics experiment team, I found that I didn't know the details of the experiment, so I cannot make plan in advance.
8.0	Instead, I let the experiment start fisrt and solved all the problem in the following time.
8.0	Even though I didn't have a well prepared plan, I solved the problem and got good result.
5.0	Moreover, be creative can help us to update existing solution and increase efficiency.
9.0	The wide-spread solution  may not be the best solution, at this time, be creative can help us to think of new solution.
9.0	For example, a worker in the car factory think the way of selling cars is not suitable for the conditions now, so he thinks of a new idea to sell the cars and double the selling amount.

3.0	My niece is 8 years old.
3.0	When I went home last weekend, I saw my sister give her 100yuan for getting a great mark in school and she is very excited for that of course, but in my mind, it is not the best way to show the parents's care and proud.
6.0	The pepple who will do this like my sister may think that money is wellcomed by the children.
8.0	The children will do better next time to get more money as reword.
8.0	But thit is not ture actually.
8.0	Firstly, that differs amony different children.
8.0	No one will throw money away, but for those children who are left at home with their grandparents, maybe the best gift for them to have their parents back by their side, living with them.
8.0	Secondly, this behavor may lead them to a wrong conception of money and success as well.
8.0	For example, they may have the idea that grades are the most important thing in his school life, so they don't need to do other things like do some volunteering work.
8.0	Even seriously, they may do some disgraceing things like cheating in the exam to get that high marks.
8.0	Thirdly, the parents should that what the children need is true encouragement.
3.0	As we all know, many incidents occur in the everyday life of our own, however, is it really important to care about or to get known about the events happening around the world, even if it is unlikely that they will affect your daliy life?
11.0	"I would prefer ""yes"" to this question,especially when the view to the world, the adding to our experience and the change of our sense of value are taken into consideration."
4.0	Firstly, in my point of view, the process of learing the events in our world is the procedure to broaden one's view toward the world.
8.0	As the saying once said, reading a thousands of books can not be compared to the traveling of millon miles.
8.0	And in this time with the advanced technology of information, the best way to travel is to learn about the events that are occurring everyday in every part of our world.
8.0	"And along with the ""travel and adventure"", our horizion and view get the chances to form and ameliorate, thanks to the gradual knowledge towards our world."
4.0	Moreover,the learing of the ongoing things of the world, will equip us with the experience that would help in our work.
9.0	A large amount breakthrough are achieved in almost each area everyday, so does the area that we are working for or are studying for.
9.0	Though they may not be concernd with our daily life, but is the knowing to these events that help us to accumulate experience, or expertise accuratly, which will pave us with a much more promising road toward the future in the work and the life.
4.0	Last but not least, the getting to know about the occuring events will help to improve the sense of value of us.
8.0	When we open the news, we will frequently see some heros that devote their efforts and life to attach attention to the work of their own or to serve the country and society that they love.
8.0	It is their qualities and spirits that teach us the example of what we need to follow and become, and thus changing the sense of value that we has.
8.0	So it is the learing process that gets us to form the suitable sense of value and spirits that we need.
0.0	What we can't deny is that the events that are happening may not be affected to our daliy life.
0.0	But it is this process that hellp us to develop our sense of value, our sense of view to the world and experience.
0.0	sO
3.0	Do you point out the something incorrect of others at the public situation?
3.0	And do you interrupt others when they are talking in front of a lot of people?
11.0	I think we must point out the incorrect information and give this preson our opinion but we should not interupt this person because it is very rude.
11.0	So in my opinion I will wait to the class and the meeting is over, and then talk to the teacher or the leader.
6.0	Firstly, to point out the incorrect information of others is a show of the critical thinking.
8.0	When I was a boy, my teacher always teach me that you must believe the truth.
8.0	This thinking is very important to our whole life study because this shows that we are think of these topic and listen very carefully.
8.0	If we hear the fault information and do not point out, we may lose the thirsty to the truth and follow the public thinking.
8.0	It is very terrible because when the public thinking is wrong and we know it but do not point out.
8.0	The development of the sociaty will stop the wrong information will spread widely.
8.0	If these very great science did not point out the truth of this world, the human will not develop like nowsday.
8.0	Maybe we are afraid of pointing out the misticks of teachers or the meeting leaders because they are all very powerful.
8.0	But if we use a very reasonable way to tell them, they will be very happy to hear these advices.
2.0	On the other hand, if we interrupt the teacher or the professor at the public situation, they will feel very shade.
8.0	This is because, most time they told us the knowledge and lead us to do things and most time they are right.
8.0	So other people all believe them.
8.0	But you stand out to point out their mistakes, others will begain to think should we listen to him?
8.0	And this behave is very rude.
7.0	Whatever mistakes they make, we should not offen
12.0	I tend to think it's a good idea because student need some power to learn.
8.0	To begin with, the money given for high grade the children get in school encourages them to work harder.
8.0	There is no doubt that children, as well as adults, would be motivative when they are admitted in some way.
8.0	So the money here is a kind of honor, rewards.
8.0	After being rewarded by his mother in giving him money whenhe got progress in the study he retained his confidence in studying and catch up quickly.
8.0	Obviously, it is the honor and encouragement the money given by his mother brings him the motivation to work Admittedly, the mony on the hand of children may cause some bad use like in computer games or toys.
8.0	But compared with the benefits it bring to the children, these points are too small and limited to pool myself out of my position.
3.0	Some parents offer their children money for each high grade they get in school .
12.0	I don't think this is a good idea.
12.0	It has many reasons.
12.0	First,the school-age children don't need so much money,because the children in school don't have many chances to use money.
12.0	Too much money for students takes bad habits.
8.0	Otherwise,if parents give children money after each hidh grade they get in school,children will study for money.
8.0	If oneday parents don't give money,the children won't want to stude any more.
8.0	Second,studying is students' duty.
8.0	Whatever parents give money or not,We must be hardworking for ourselves.
8.0	The meaning of life is not getting more money,we should find more meaningful things and work for them.
8.0	Surly,parents shouldn't only take highly of their children's grade.
8.0	High grade is really grateful,but children's thinking is more important.
10.0	As a student ,I think students need to study for theirselves,not for parents,not for money.
3.0	With the accelerating development of our society, financially responsible becomes a common top in our daily life.
11.0	In order to cultive the ability, people start to manage their available money.
11.0	Some people start to manage and control their money when they start their first job, but I strongly believe that people should learn to manage their finance when they are young.
12.0	So they can try to save money to buy their desired things and know the value of the common things.
5.0	Firstly, children learn to earn and deposit money for buying something they want.
8.0	To be specific, children can know what is important to them and try hard to afford the things.
8.0	To illustrate, when I was a child, I was interested in animals and wanted to buy a set of animal models, but the price of them was hard to afford as a child.
8.0	I asked for my father, he told me if I wanted to buy something I could not afford at present, I should earn money by myself and save the money until I was able to afford it, so I cultivated the ability to control my money.
8.0	After I graduated, I still recalled what my father told me when I had a desired thing, and I would save money and deposit just as when I wanted to buy the animal models.
8.0	That helped me a lot.
5.0	Secondly, children know the value and importance of every by learning managing money.
9.0	In other words, children can apparently know how a particular thing deserves and learn to judge whether they are enough valuable or not, thus they learn to cherish the valuable things.
9.0	For example,
12.0	In order to let our children grow, some parents let their child to make mistakes so that they can learn from their mistakes.
11.0	However,some parents don't want their child to do anything wrong nomatter what has happened.
11.0	I am support with this statement.
11.0	It is truly a good way to help children's growth by making them learn the lesson from their own problems.
5.0	First, the child can better memorize the mistake they made before so that they won't do this again.
8.0	When a kid realize that he has made a mistake, he won't forget it for a long time.
8.0	However, if you keep telling your child not to do something, sometimes the thing you are wondering may happened.
8.0	Some kids can't remember your words all the time.
8.0	For example, riding a bicycle.
8.0	Can you remember how to keep balance when you first learn to ride it?
8.0	Of course you can't.
8.0	Although your father keeps telling you the solution to ride it, you can't learn to ride it until you have go through this problems.
8.0	Only after you have failen to the ground several times that you can handle this skill.
8.0	By this way, the statement can also be explained.
5.0	Second, we can challenge our childrens by letting them make mistakes.
8.0	If a child keeps making troubles, but every time he can learn the lesson from his mistakes, he can have a lot of skills.
8.0	For example, a baby is trying to learn walking.
8.0	We can't help him because if we hold him that he won't fall, he can't learn to walk forever.
8.0	Kids can face a lot of challenges by learning from a lot of mistakes.
8.0	If I broken a window, I would be asked to clean it and to pay for my mistake with my pocket money.
8.0	Also I could learn how to deal with such things next time.
8.0	By this way, the kids can have a better growth.
0.0	To make a conclution, it is better a have a kid make mistakes so that they can learn a lot from them.
0.0	If the child haven't made any mistake before, it is hard for him to handle a complex situation.
0.0	I believe that parents should accept that their kids might cause some troubles sometimes also it is impossible to ask a kid not to do anything wrong.
3.0	As society develops，person begin to concertrate on the importance of the relax.
3.0	Someone perfer to watch a movie or reading a book.
11.0	But I hold the view that relax by doing physical exercise better than relax by watching a movie or reading a book.
5.0	Firstly，I think that doing physical exercise not only can relax ourselves but also exercise our body.
8.0	Because of busy studying, we may serch some information or write thesis all days.
8.0	At that time, we need some different things to relax us.
8.0	Therefore I think sports is a good choice.
5.0	Secondly, we should do some exercise to make our body becoming strong.
8.0	Health is very important for us.
8.0	Whatever we do, one of most pivotal condition is a healthy body.
8.0	So，when we busy with our studying，we need take some time off doing physical exercise.
8.0	Only by this way,we can get success at last.
2.0	So we can draw a conclusion that relax by doing physical exercise better than relax by watching a movie or reading a book.
11.0	We all say that mistakes are the best gifts for your success, because you can learn some experience form these.
11.0	What/s more, no one can advoid making some mistakes, so we should face to it bravely and learn from it is better than think how to avoid it.
12.0	In my opinion, parents as the first teacher in their children's life, so it a good chose to let chlidren make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.
5.0	As we all know, everybody will make mistakes, and we can learm something which can not be get in other ways.
9.0	If your life is always peaceful and the children will think everything can be get easily, so that they would lack the motivation to do some research.
9.0	Only through some mistakes which made by themselves, they should know is not true that everything is easy, and it is benifit for them to treasure everyting they have now.
5.0	Mistakes are a good teacher to teach us to get some valuable theroies.
8.0	Once you made a mistake and you must be review the whole process you have done, and  it can not only make you memorise it deeply but also can help you to think about yourself ceaselessly.
8.0	After that, you will find your growth through it.
8.0	If you do noy have this opportunity to do this thing, you will lack this process which can make you to be a good person.
2.0	To sum up, parents is just a leader in their children's life, so they should let their chlidren to find the world by themselves through some mistakes they made.
10.0	It is necessary for them to understand some thing really and good for their life.
11.0	Today many people think that the other people become more and more coldbloodness,and after many social issue , I has regretly accept this idea that people today are no longer want to help others.
5.0	"For example there are a sensational issues happen in GuangDong  China in 2016 called ""little yue  yue issue"" ,the issue is about a little girl called  ""yue yue"" ,when she crossing the crossing road,she was hitted by a big trucks."
8.0	the driver felt so scared that he absconded.
8.0	left the poor little girl lay on the road.
8.0	and before somebody found her and calld police,she has being rolling by several cars,and during this period of time hundreds people passed by but none of them stand out and try to help even just to confirm what happend to that girl.
8.0	some of them might really didn't pay attention on what happen on road but many of them seen it but choosed no to help and just escape.
5.0	the reason that these people choose no to help seems very redicuros: they just afraid of get into trouble,afraid of the parent of little girl will prosecute them as murderer.
8.0	but this kind of worry seems reasonable because there are some people  who cause traffic accident wilful to swindle the drivers.
8.0	they want to help others but afferid of be deceived.
8.0	So from my view ,the reason that people no longer want to help others is some people try to use others kindness to make money,this behavior stopped people to help other.
8.0	the best solvutation is the goverment punish laws to protect the rights of people who hlep others,and punish the people wo try to abuse this king of kindness.
8.0	only in this way can we incourage more people to help others and build a more harmonious social.
12.0	The issue of children should be rewarded for high grade has heated up in recent years.
12.0	A mojority of people think that it is a way to encourage them to hardworking,while others hold the view that this will give children more money and chance to have fun.
12.0	As far as i am concerned,i am favour of the latter view.
5.0	In today's society,give them money when they got the high grade is a way to encourage child to study,however this method can cultivate bad habits of children,they should know that they learn for their own interests,not for money.
10.0	Give them too much money means give them chance to have fun with classmates,besides,this allows the child to cheat on the test in order to het a high mark.
5.0	The reason i am favour not doing that is because the kids in the disadvantaged family do not have to study hard?
10.0	In my view children study because they are interested, not just for money.
7.0	there are many ways to reward children,but they don't have to be mate
3.0	With the development of technology, the events around the world have approach to most of people in different soiecities.
11.0	Some people think it is vital to get to know these events, while others may regard events as the unimportant news, because they cannot influence the daily life of ordinary people.
11.0	As for me, I hold the idea that knowing events around the events have good influence on people, so they need to do it.
5.0	First, knowing more great events is a good method to develop thinking ability.
8.0	There is no doubt that when people are exposed to an event, they will think about it and have their own attitude.
8.0	This process includes receving the information, understand its meaning, analyze it and then get attitude, people may even discuss the event with other people, so it is a good way to involve thinking, which benefits people's thinking ability.
8.0	I like thinking the events around the world, because during the thinking time, not only could I know about the world outside my home, but also it can help to improve my comprehensive thinking ability.
5.0	Second, knowing more about events happenin around the world could provide some common topics for people when they are commuicating with others.
8.0	Now imagine the sence people have to meet with the person they do not know.
8.0	The best way to get relaxed is to talk about some common topics, such as the events happening rencently.
8.0	It provide people with a way to exchange ideas and get to know each other.
8.0	Take my own experience for example, last Firday I attened a group to finish the assignment from my professor.
8.0	There was a stranger named Mary who I didn't know at that time.
8.0	After meeting with her, I started a topic and we talked about the Prime Minister of UK.
8.0	It is really interesting and we didn't feel embarrased at all.
2.0	Actally, I could understand some people may think the events around the world are not related with their daily life, because they are busy with their work with no time to think about them, and the events, especially the e
3.0	Recently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people: whether leader born with leadership.
3.0	Opinions vary from people to people.
3.0	Some claim that leadership is too special to learn.
11.0	However, I wholeheartedly agree that everyone can learn to be a leader.
10.0	My opinion can be elaborated as followed.
5.0	First of all, one of the most importand element of leadership is having positive influence to employees.
8.0	As we all know, leaders are not talents or experts of some field.
8.0	Leader is the person who can firmly lead the whole company work in the same direction to accomplish the final goal.
8.0	Therefore, leaders need to know how to encourage their worker and how to arrange the workers' task in order to  increase their working efficiency.
8.0	All of those thing can be learned by everyone because it just contains something about motivating employees or setting a final goal.
8.0	On the contrary, if the leadership comes naturally, I do not think a kid can master some skills to encourage others and force them to do something for him.
8.0	For example, my cousin Jason never be a confident person.
8.0	So when he was a child, his parents thought he must be a employee in the future.
8.0	However, Jason is the leader of his team and he works in the largest network company named Tencent Company in China.
8.0	He is still inconfident, but he learns to know every member of his team well, so he can motivate them well when working.
8.0	Therefore, postive effect can be learned.
5.0	Second, the creed of leadership is never give up.
1.0	As we all know, it is easy for people to give up.
1.0	But as leaders, when all the employees want to give up, they cannot give up.
8.0	Only the people have this creed, he can be a really leader.
8.0	However, this quality is not form naturally because only after experiencing many hard things people can develop this spirit.
8.0	Take myself for example.
8.0	When I was a child, I always gave up and cried because of fearful.
8.0	After
3.0	Nowadays, most of people meet the situation of you disaggre about the words which come from your boss or teachers.
3.0	People usually have some choices to express their own opinions right now, follow their words and tell their own feelings after meetings or classes.
11.0	In my opinion, I prefer say nothing and follow them.
11.0	There have some reasons.
5.0	Firstly, say nothing does not give terrible impact to your bosses or teachers.
8.0	Sometimes, say nothing and follow the bosses or teachers will give others a dependent personality to other people,expecially the bosses.
8.0	They will think you are a good employer, because you follow them.
8.0	For example, my friend Lee, he had a great opposite opinion to his boss last Monday.
8.0	But he decided to hide his opinion, he fellow the boss.
8.0	In Thursday, his boss thought Lee did very well in his normal weekday.
8.0	So, his boss gave Lee a big subsidy for Lee's car fuel.
8.0	Actually,Lee did nothing, just fellow the boss.
8.0	In conclusion, say nothing is the most safe way to give a excellent impact to the boss.
5.0	Secondly, wait until the class or meeting is over and the people are gone, and then talk to the teacher or meeting leader is a good way for expressing the opinions.
8.0	This also give the boss or teacher a good impact.
8.0	However, as we all know meeting and classroom telling mostly decide someting we need to do or how we can do.
8.0	After the class or meeting, all of extra opinion become inefficient or useless.
8.0	Because all of things are talked in the classroom or meeting.
8.0	For example, my classmate Ane talked to the teacher after the class last month.
8.0	She thought her teacher had a wrong opinion in the party of charity.
8.0	Her teacher became anoyed, because anything orf this party are discussed.
8.0	So all of the words from her opinion become useless.
10.0	In conclusion,  say nothing
12.0	In this world, high grade is a goal of both parents and students, but some students have no ability to get a high grade, or can not get a high grade easily.
12.0	In these case, some parents will offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in shcool.
11.0	I think it is a good idea because of the following ideas.
4.0	First , it stimulates children's interesting about studying, because if they get a high grade, they will get a prize, the money.
10.0	Almost every children have a desire of money, because they have no idea with the value of money, not only the number on it but also the working behind the paper.
4.0	Second, it gives a chance to let children learn how to deal with money.
8.0	If a children have money, they usually have two  ways to deal with it, spend all of the money, or keep it and never use it.
8.0	they are both wrong.
8.0	Spending all of the money is not good, but keeping it forever is wrong, too.
8.0	If parents offer their children money for each high grade, the children's grade will be higher, and the children will have more chances to learn how to deal with money.
8.0	In this case, It not only stimulates children to study hard but also lets children to learn more out of the school.
4.0	Third,  and the finally, it can let children know that no pay no gain.
8.0	Because ther need to spent many time on study for the high grade, so they pay time to study, and then they gain money for their high grade.
8.0	In this case, they will know that if, and only if you paid, you will gain sometime later.
8.0	It is also knowledge out of the school.
2.0	In my view, parents offering money for each high grade children get, is in order to let child have a plan to leran more, and by offering them money, children can know more about the life, anout the world, it absolutely is a good thing, so I think offer money for children's high grade is a good idea.
11.0	While so many examples of successful celebrities, such as Bill Gates, have caught the attention of the public nowadays, individules have a greater ambition to succeed in their careers.
11.0	While some contend that people are getting more willing to give a hand to others, I believe it's not the case, for nowadays, people aer afraid of dealing with strangers.
12.0	Furthermore, only a few poeple haev the ability to support other's life.
5.0	First of all, many of us may have rthe experience that parents told us seriously, when we are just a little boy or a girl, not to talk to a stranger on the street.
8.0	They want to in still a veiwpoint that, don't simply believe others, since they are probly intend to hurt you.
8.0	In this case, an incresingly essential thought in our minds emerged, that the strangers are scarcely harmless.
8.0	And  from then on , when individules face to the society, they are carrying an overwhelming sense of protecting themselves, including getting rid of the strangers.
8.0	Even though they are clear that they would misunderstand numerous ones who own a kind heart, this attitude towards the strangers definitely won't let them in danger.
5.0	On top of that, when someone consider about other's lives, they must think of theirs first.
8.0	The world is getting more and more competitive, with the increasing size of the population.
8.0	What if they are just able to primarily supporting themselves?
8.0	Of course they are not likely to accept a stranger to lighten their burden.
8.0	In short, there aren't a lot of people who are confident to say that they are able to accept a strangers.
11.0	I think this isn't a good a idea.
12.0	Nowadays,the school-age children are influenced by the audlts.
11.0	They both think that the money is too important i our daily lives.
11.0	I adimt that money is important for everyone.
8.0	But a school-age children don't need the money,instead they prefer accompany or praise.
8.0	And if we treat the money as a prize,well the children will think that the money is all they want.
8.0	It's too early to let they know the importance of the money.
4.0	Secondly,if you continue to offer your school-age children money for each high grade,they maybe won't study for themsleves.
8.0	Maybe all they think is if they get good grades,they will have money.
8.0	This isn't the truth meaning of study.
8.0	If one day you refuse to pay the money for the good grades,they will lose the passion to study.
8.0	So,Ithink it's a bad system.
4.0	Thirdly,many children don't have clear goals now.
9.0	If you give money for their good grades in this period,they will treat the money as their goal.
9.0	If they choose the money as their goal,they will lose chance which to choose the more meaningful things as their goals.
4.0	The last reason is I think the school-age children are not good at keeping their money.
8.0	Most of them can't put their money in good use.
8.0	Maybe they will waste it like buying something unhealthlyor something not necessary.
8.0	It will develop a bad habit.
4.0	I adimt that sometimes offer school-age children money for high mark will encourage them to work hard.
9.0	But I think the disadvantage is more than advantage.
9.0	So I think some parents offer their school-age children money for high grade they get in school isn't a good idea.
2.0	That's all.
10.0	Thanks for reading.
3.0	From my perspective, I don't think it's a good idea for parents to offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.
11.0	The reasons to support my point of view are as follows.
6.0	First of all, it is admittidly that when a student enters school he or she should make every endeavour to learn.
8.0	But a high grade is not the ultimate standard.
8.0	We should evaluate our kids behavior in school by the knowledge they gained and the horizons they have broadened instead of those marks that are showed on test papers.
8.0	The scores are only part of the facts accounting for a child's excellent behavior.
8.0	Moreover, if you emphasize the importance of a high grade too much, the true essence of learning would be lost.
8.0	In order to get those seemingly high marks, students would learn by rote instead of learning by heart.
8.0	What is worse is that some students may even cheat or try other methods to get a good mark.
8.0	Providing money would cause a totally controversial result to our original purpose.
8.0	Last but not least, I persume that school-age children are too young to recieve money of their own.
8.0	As stationaries and textbooks are already provided, it is questionable where they might use these extra money.
8.0	Will they use it in the right way as parents expected or will it be spent in places we don't want them to be spent?
8.0	Rewards and encouragments are necessary when a child makes progress or performs greatly, however, what kinds of things should we give to our kids should be considered deeply.
8.0	Giving them books with a great variance, taking them on a family trip rather than money for hooking up with friends will ensure that the parents efforts will not go down the drain.
1.0	All in all, I think giving money to our immature school-age children is unwise.
1.0	By building other encouragment system will definitly enable your child to grow better thus it is of great necessity.
11.0	There are many people think that doing physical exercise is better than watching a movie or reading a book to relax.
11.0	But in my opinion, watching a movie or reading a book is better than doing physical exercise.
5.0	I have numerous reason to explain that why watching a movie or reading a book is better than doing phtsical exercise, and I'll choose the most important reason to explain.
9.0	Watching a movie or reading a book just need you to focus on the story and understand that, use your mind.
9.0	it's not consume your energy and go out, and another advantage is that it can increase your knowledge.
5.0	But it's not means doing physical exercise is not useful.
9.0	Doing physical exercise is a good way to relax.
9.0	Therefore,some of the people, such as high school student, they often doing physical exercise before the test in order to decrease the pressure.
1.0	These two ways are all good way to relax, but if compare these two ways, doing physical exercise is not fit in many situation.
1.0	Therefore, I think watching a movie or reading a book is better than doing physical exercise.
3.0	Internet is always important in our daily life.
3.0	There is a heat discussion about whether the internet should start charging fees or not.
3.0	On the one hand, free internet can make more people access to  see the material on it and can cause a hugh influence.
3.0	On the other hand, internet with cost has its benefits as well.
3.0	From my perspective, i would prefer the latter one.
11.0	There are some reasons below.
5.0	Firsly, internet with cost has less security problems.
8.0	As we can discover that there are a lot of advertisement windows stay at the free website which we are visiting.
8.0	It is annoying and sometimes they have virus.
8.0	When you try to close it, it will soon transport you to its website and force your computer to download its virus or some applications with virus.
8.0	What's worse, you can not even stop it.
8.0	And soon, as a result, your computer paralyzed and you may lose your precious and important files and photoes.
8.0	After that, you still need to spend vast time to fix it and make sure this virus is wiped out.
8.0	However, the charging internets usually do not have that kinds of trouble.
8.0	Because i know i spend money visiting this internet, then there will be some technical stuff to make sure its safety and the company who runs the website do not to need advertisements for making money for they aleardy have charged from customers.
5.0	Moreover, it show respect to the creators of the websites or the applications on internet.
8.0	Everyone is aware that creating something original is difficult and some fee is neccesary.
8.0	For instance, i once looked up for a economical analysis artile on internet, and i found that there was one was really great for i only read a paragraph of it.
8.0	But i needed to pay some money for it to comtinue my reading.
8.0	I though this was fair enough, for the writer must spent a lot of time on it and i should pay for it as a his or her reward.
8.0	So i did, and it only costed me 2 dollars.
8.0	The price was not that expensive.
8.0	It was really worth paying for such a high quality passage.
8.0	As a result, i learnt a lot from it.
2.0	In conclusion, the government should provide internet to the public with cost without doubt, for its safey and our respect for the original authors and creators.
12.0	Nowadays, due to the rapid development of society, the issue of what types of work people will do has become an increasingly controvercial topic.
12.0	Some believe that they should do different works during workday, while others believe that they prefer to the same works all day.
11.0	Although I have some doudt, I tend to agree with the former, and I will articulate my view below.
5.0	First, diverse tasks can make persons' minds more active.
10.0	The different one can make our
5.0	Besides, it is work skill that the disparat work can bring to you.
10.0	Finally, although the same tasks may more easier to do than the different one, it can't bring satisfaction to worfers.
3.0	Children from time to time make different kinds of mistakes.
3.0	Many of which are nantural but later other mistakes could turn out to be undesirable.
3.0	For that problemas parents you had better be some what paradoxical in your attitudes toward raising children from stage to stage.
3.0	The paradox is like that,at an early stage,children are always expected to stand uo and walk as well as to open themouth and speak;while at an elder age,children are often asked to simply sit down and keep quiet.
5.0	Naturely,mistakes that toddlers make are infantile events given them to grow up.
8.0	For istance,you would never tie a rope to a baby and teach it to climb stairs by hauling it up by the rope.
8.0	Nor would you spank a baby for not learning to speak quickly enough.
8.0	It is because the baby by their own error.
8.0	As we all know ,practice makes perfect.
8.0	So,if there is no learing happening,mistakes would have no worth at all.
8.0	As can be imagined,mistakes might cause pain or impatience,and yet thy could provide opporunities for growth.
8.0	In this respect,only very smallchildren should be allowed to make mistakes'unconditionalli'because this process of'trial and error'makes walking possible and speech possible.
5.0	While making mistakes is a part of life,itis your response to the child'serror that counts.
8.0	when children should come to the age to start learning to distinguish right from wrong,you ought to explain what sorts of mistakes should not happen,being conditioned under differnt cinditions.
8.0	In other words,not trying avoid situations in which children might  make mistakes.
8.0	Therefore,it is not the right thing to do toturn a bliend eye and a deaf ear to some of children's serious mistakes because you can only look at the stars but not down at you feet.
8.0	Tell your children,be curious and howerer difficult life may seem ,there is always someting you can do and successed at.
8.0	In certain sense,for younger children there are no mistakes,save one-the failure to learnfrom mistakes.
8.0	From stage to stage,children make mistakesof different sorts.
1.0	Accordingly,the key to good parenting is nt see achild's negative mistake everytime as an end product,but rather as a positive begining for progress of life.
1.0	Remember to tell your children,be curious and howerer difficult life may seem ,there is always someting you can do and successed at.
3.0	Many studies have been couducted to find out the keys to sucess.
3.0	Some may states that being the same as others is one of the keys.
11.0	Others may argue that people should found their own unique identity to seperate from the mass, and those differences may help people to succeed.
11.0	As for me, I agree with the later, and I believe that people must behave differently from others.
5.0	First, it is common that customer do not choose a product for they are identical to other products, but their unique characters; So dose today's employers and invertors.
8.0	I went to a interview last month, and i was been selected as the only interen form other five candidates.
8.0	The others five people all dressed balck suites and using the same forms of resume; however; i dressed myself a dark blue suites and using the form I designed.
8.0	The director are more interested in me and ask how I designed my own form of resume.
8.0	I took advantage of being differenet to show them my ability to use complex computer software and impressed them.
5.0	Second, innovation is the key to suceess, and innovation needs creativities which basicly means baheving differently from others.
8.0	We do not own an iphone about 20 years ago, now it changes our lives, but send a death note to NOKIA about  year ago.
8.0	In 2013, NOKIA was leading the market by his own product and others are following NOKIA to mamufacture phone with the same technology.
8.0	However, iphone did not choose to act as the others and tried to invent a new technology, which makes them succeed.
3.0	Recently, the discussion of whether new generation should have the ability to plan and organize gain many public attention and gardually became a hot topic.
11.0	Needless to say, the ability to plan and organize is always improtant in our daily life.
5.0	To start with, learning how to be organized can cultivate children's independence.
8.0	When I was a child, I always lelt my mother to take care of my personal belongings to prevent things getting lost.
8.0	I think most of kids are doing exact thing like me.
8.0	However, parents can't take care of you all your lifetime.
8.0	Who's going to take care of your stuff or even property when you are along?
8.0	Children will be more independent if they learn how to plan and organized their own business.
5.0	Second,mapping out ahead of time help them to manage their personal finance and avert excessive consumption.
8.0	For instance, Once I my parents give my a little amount of money and they wish I can manage them wisly.
8.0	I was trying to use the money wisely but I can't irrisistible the temptation so I use d up the money in few days.
8.0	If I learn how to manage and organized, I would use the money in a proper way.
8.0	What's more, having the ablility to plan and manage help children do better in their study.
7.0	For example, when the teacher give us an assignment, we always do it
3.0	We usually see the phenomenon that family memebrs can only get together during Spring Festival, and we usually spend other time of  a year just with our mother or father.
3.0	Also, modern lifestyle caused by the advanced society is separating us from our extended family members.
3.0	And, the fact that young people tend to stay with their classmates or friends rather than extended family members is not uncommon.
12.0	So through all of this , we can draw a conculsion that the less important .
5.0	First, people often have their own thing to deal with, so they have no time to sit down and talk with their extended family members.
8.0	For example, soem people from countryside are working in big city to get money and feed their family in China.
8.0	I have seen a result of an investigation in a magzine which points out that people working in the countryside are expected to go back to visit their cousins or aunts,  but their job doesn't allow them to do this sinc they need the salary to feed their family.
8.0	Then, because the distance from your family, you may have less metionally relationship with your extended family.
8.0	They are more like some fimilar persons to you.
5.0	Secondary,  the society are stepping into an industrial condition.
8.0	Modern lifestyle separtes us with the extended family members.
8.0	We are not in the countryside any more.
8.0	During 1960s to 1980s, we depend on agriculture.
8.0	And family always lived together, ate together, and worked together and at forth.
8.0	The concept of family is extremely important in people's brains during that time.
8.0	Because you are so closer with your extended family members so your relationship was very good.
8.0	But what about now?
8.0	With countryside becoming less and city becoming more, the concept of a single person is playing a more significant role in our brain.
8.0	We are desiring to possess our own life instead of living together with extended family members.
8.0	And this results in the decreaing level of extended family.
8.0	They are no more important, since we have been affected by the modern lifestyle.
0.0	Lastly,  the young people nowadays almost don't visit their grandparents or cousins.
0.0	They want to play with their friends or classmates because you have more to communicate with.
0.0	Each of us have the experience.
0.0	Our parents command us to g owith them to visit our cousins and aunts.
0.0	But we refuse just because one friend of mine are inviting me to go out with him to have fun.
0.0	Then because the less visits, the status of extened family members is decearsing.
3.0	In recent years, as the social competions become much more fierce than before, some people contends that colleges students are supposed to focus on their major cources and spend more time in the library .
12.0	However, as far as I am concerned, sports and social activities are just the same important as classes and libraries, which can not only build up students' body but alse elavate their all kinds of ablilies and expand their social network.
4.0	Reading books in the library or doing researchs in the lab both require the students' high attention and energy.
8.0	Just as an old saying goes'body is the bsics of working'.
8.0	Therefore, it's necessary for students to spend time on doing sports.
8.0	It is proved that a person who are used to exercising is clearly much more energetic than the one who doen't like exercising.
4.0	Beside, a college student can't always focus on enhace their skills of gaining new kownlege or doing the research, there are a great many other skills that they have to pay  attentions to.
8.0	For instance, the ability of expression is a crucial ability for college students.
8.0	These days, it's difficult to get success by yourself,and it's means that you should work with others in groups to pursue achievement.
8.0	Therefore, if you lack of the ability to express your opinions, it will be hard for you to get into the group.
4.0	Finally, taking part in the social activities can also benefit you on expanding your network.
9.0	Nowadays,friends paly a pretty important role than ever before.
9.0	They can not only communicate with you about the new ideas or opinions ablout a project but alse can give you some help when you are in trouble.
1.0	All in all, as a college student, we should never focus only on the classes or libraries, sports and social actibiities are important as well.
1.0	They are supposed to receive equal financial support because they are parts of a successful education.
11.0	Leadership is an important term nowadays and is regarded as one of the critical abitlities of man who wants to manage a group or a ogrnization such as a school or a enterprise.
12.0	A collective without leardership will be in a mess and cannot survive for such a long time.
12.0	However, there are conflict thinking when talking about  leadership's foramtion.
3.0	Some believe that the leadership are formed born with.
11.0	Another thinking is that the people can aquire the leadership by practicing in life experience.
11.0	From my point of view, I am against the former concept.
10.0	The reasons are as follows:
5.0	First, practice makes perfect.
8.0	Leadership requires a lot of factors to learn.
8.0	If a people wants to be a leader, he or she needs to know the procedure of a group or a organization, like how to produce the products and how to know the need of    certain group of people.
8.0	It can't be imagined a company like Alibaba in China will hire a CEO who just focus on find cennections with the goverments and ask for strong support from it.
8.0	The facts turn out to be converse of Alibbaba which can sell all the products the consumer needs, which is closely related to a wise decision of the leader who has known about the real need of comsumers.
8.0	Through the error and trial, Jack became a titan leader in China and even in the wolrd.
5.0	Secondly, what has happened in the history proves that a true leader is chosen by the situation and the need of people.
9.0	In the1930s to 1940s of China, there were two parties which could take charge of China, but because the Communists represent the intersts and the calls of the trend, eventually the Communists came into power  in China, and Chairman Mao is regarded as one of the greatest leaders in the world.
9.0	it is  just after thousandd battle and guide experences that Chairman Mao become the leader of New China.
10.0	Thirdly,
12.0	Nowadays, more and more parents offer their children who are still in school money for each high grade they get in school.
11.0	Some people consider it a good idea but others disagree with them.
11.0	Personally, I am in favor of the former one.
12.0	It is believed bu me that parents provide their school-age children money for their good grade get in each examinations is a good idea.
4.0	Firstly, use money as a gift for their high grade encourage their to study harder.
8.0	Everybody in the world want more money because they can use money to get the things they want, even the school-age children.
8.0	Children in that peroid often wants a lot of things like beautiful note book, pens, fansinating books and so on, but they do not have so many money to buy them either.
8.0	If parents provide them money as a gifts for their high grade, for satisfing their desir, they must study harder to get high grade.
4.0	Secondly, use money to encourage them will give them a sence of achievement and build their confidence.
8.0	That is very important for that school-age children.
8.0	They get high grade, and then they get money as a prize.
8.0	Undoubtly, their achievement are satisfied extremely.
8.0	That will build their confidence.
8.0	For long-term plan, the short-term achievement and long-term confidence are good for their development in the future.
4.0	On the other hand, parents give money to their children for each high grade they get is not a good idea also make sence.
8.0	This kind of way of encourage may mixture the aims of study to the school-age children.
8.0	They study for a good university, for better development and future, for themselves instead of the good grade and the money.
8.0	If children think they are studying for money, that will provide a lot of problem.
8.0	If their parents stop the offering of money for the goop grade they get, they may no more work hard for study.
2.0	According to above discussion, although this kind of way has disadvantage, I think it is a good idea.
3.0	Recently, a controversial topic have aroused a heated debated among people whether people will spend less time cooking and preparing foods in twenty years than they do today.
3.0	Different opinions vary from person to person.
3.0	some person think that people will not spend less time cooking and preparing foods in twenty years than they do today.
3.0	However, I would stand ontheir opposite side and I believe people can spend less time to cooking and perparing foods in the future.
11.0	I have some reasons to explain.
6.0	First of all, people can spend less time to cooking and perparing foods in the future because they have new techique to perpare food.
8.0	After twenty years, food delivery will help people spend less time to eat food.
8.0	People only use the iphone, then they can make a meal in thirty minutes everywhere.
8.0	In contrast, food delivery is not convenience at now, maybe you should wait more than one hour.
8.0	However, in the future, food delivery system will more mature, people only spend short time to acquire a delicous food.
8.0	For example, my friend David like eat food go out of the door, he believes that it is normal way.
8.0	One day, he should finish his work and he not have time to go out of the door, so he have to make a food delivery.
8.0	Only spend twenty minutes, his meal send to his home, he is surprised it is so quickly, even he do not finish his homework.
8.0	At last, he likes to make food delivery everyday.
7.0	In addition, people can spend less time to cooking and perparing foods in the future because this society graduaaly to be a
8.0	SOME PARENTS OFFER THEIR CHILDREN MONEY FOR EACH HIGH GRADE THEY GET IN SCHOOL, I THINK THIS IS A GOOD IDEA.
8.0	BECAUSE ALL THE PEOPLE HAVE TO WORK FOR SOMETHING, AND IF YOU JUST TELL YOUR CHILDREN THAT ALL THE SCHOOL WORK THEY DID ARE FOR THEIR FUTRUE, IT'S TOO FAR FOR THEM.
8.0	THEIR PARENTS NEED GIVE SOME REWARDS FOR THEIR WORK, THEN THEY CAN HAVE A PORPOSE.
8.0	FOR EXAMPLE, ALL THE ADULTS ARE WORKING FOR SOMETHING TOO, LIKE MONEY.
8.0	IF A COMPANY WANT TO RECRUIT THE EMPLOEE BUT WITHOUT GIVING THEM MONEY, I ASSUME NO ONE WOULD COME AND WORK FOR THAT COMPANY.
8.0	EVEN IF THERE HAS SOME PEOPLE CAME, THEY WOULD NOT WORK HARD FOR NOTHING.
8.0	IT'S SAME AS CHILDREN.
8.0	IF PARENTS SHOW THEIR REWARD, AND THEIR CHILDREN REALLY WANT IT, THEY WILL WORK HARD TO GET IT, BUT DO NOT GIVE THEM VERY HIGH STANDARD.
8.0	HERE IS A BAD EXAMPLE.
8.0	"A CHILD GET F IN HISTORY EVERY SINGLE TIME, AND HIS/HER PARENTS SAID""IF YOU GET A  IN HISTORY, I WILL GIVE YOU FIVE DOLLARS"" THEN THE CHILD WILL THINK HE/SHE CAN NEVER ACHIEVE IT, SO WHY SHOULD HE/SHE WASTE HIS/HER TIME ON THE BORING STUDY."
8.0	IF SOME ONE ASK YOU TO FLY, AND TELL YOU IF YOU CAN FLY WITHOUT ANY HELP, THEN YOU CAN GET A MILLION DOLLARS, WILL YOU TRY IT, OR TAKE IT AS A JOKE?
8.0	SO THE CHILDREN NEED SOME REWARD FOR THEIR HARD WORK, AND A ACHIEVABLE LINE.
8.0	MY OPINION IS SOME PARENTS OFFER THEIR SCHOOL-AGE CHILDREN MONEY FOR EACH HIGH GRADE THEY GET IN SCHOOL IS A GOOD AND SMART IDEA, IT CAN MAKE STUDY ITSELF BE MORE FUN TO THEIR CHILDREN, IT CAN MAKE THE CHILDREN SHOW MORE INTERESTED IN STUDY, AND WORK HARDER IN THEIR WILL, THE PROCESS OF STUDY WILL CONTAIN LESS FORCE BY OTHERS, LIKE THEIR PARENTS.
3.0	Do you make decisions by yourselves?
3.0	Do you let your parents help you to make a decisions when meet very important things like find job or marrige with others?
12.0	In before, most big decisions were made by our parents and sometimes we can not resist it.
11.0	But with the change of the view and the developement of the economic, young man can make the decisions by themselves more and more.
10.0	And even decision the toward of their life.
5.0	Firstly, when we graduate from the university, we have to find a job to feed ourselves.
8.0	At the past time, these young man should ask for their parents because they had more experiment than us.
8.0	They even arranged a job that we do not like it actually and they want us to do the same job as their.
8.0	But nowdays young men  most of them gain very high level education than before.
8.0	And with the development of the sociaty, the young men are more creative and exciting than their parents.
8.0	As a result of that, they can make more reasonable decision than their parents.
8.0	They will not listen to their parents to just be a employment in a big company, they will creat the business of themselves.
8.0	So they can contral their life and to do the things they really want to do.
5.0	Second, in the past time parents played a very important role in the marriage in China.
8.0	And they thought that the life of the young people was belong to them.
8.0	So they can decide their children marriage with who and if their children loved a people which cannot satisfy them, they can disagree their marriage.
8.0	But nowdays the thinking of both our parents and ourselves are more opening tha before.
8.0	If a young people love a girl or a man and he or she also love the young people, they can marriage.
8.0	And the relationship between them is prorect by the law.
7.0	Furthermore parents also think that find a person that their chil
11.0	Nowsdays, more and more people want thier children can study,so they offer their school-age children money for each high gread thery get in school.
11.0	They do it , because they want they want encourage their children to study, In my opinion I think it a good way for student motivates learning,it is a good idea.
4.0	To begin with, many student think study very boring.
10.0	they can not find a way to inspire they passion, but if they parent give thier money, they have gifts, they will get motivates learning, they will study hard, because they want get money they will earn the high grade, so this can help them to study, so I think the parent offer student money will help them find motivates learning.
4.0	secondly, the parent give they child money, it is affirmation of their effors, if the parent never give any gift or reward, they can not fell they effors is avaiable, they can not have any power to study.
10.0	so I think the parent should offer child money to affirmation of their effors , it is also a good way for student study.
4.0	Althogh, the parent offer thier child money, some child will free money, they can not understang earn money is very diffcult, but they also can study how to manage thier money.
10.0	it is a best way to teach student manage thier life.
10.0	Finally,the parent give moeny
3.0	Ten years ago, the development of techinque is extremely slow and hard, if people want to gain some information or find a suitable position, there is no doubt that it is really difficult for them to have a complete understanding the whole different employments and have a convinvent opportunity for select a favourable position because of the limitation of spreading information or date.
11.0	Then, taking the daily situation into consideration, I have a profound conviction that in the modern life, individuals can identify the type of career of job more complelely instead of in the past.
4.0	First of all, people have some valuable approaches to get a better understanding about the whole jobs or career owing to the ocurrance of a lot of up-to-date techinique.
8.0	Therefore, it is convinent for them to find a suitable position instandly, leading them to succeed easily.
8.0	For instance, my father was a chief who worked in the nearby restaustant ten years ago, but he dislike cooking and staying at the kitchen.
8.0	However, he could not change the job due to the limitation of gaining more lastest information that enlist people.
8.0	But now, he has the choice to surf on the Internet and graze a number of news, finally he selects a satisfied position.
8.0	Therefore, my father will be prone to succeed on account of interest and figure out what job is secure.
4.0	On top of that, there are more various and diverse opportunities that many corporations offers.
9.0	It is because that with the rasing of people's living standard,so many fields such as entertainment or education needs a lot of employees to work.
9.0	So compared with the condition in the past, people have more ways to choose jobs, and as a result of awaredness of security, people are more likey to find a job that is secure.
4.0	Adimitedly, in the past, people lived in a simple life, so it does not surprise us to discover that many peolpe such as our grandmother and grandfather enjoy the simple but secure life.
10.0	But the reason that they will succeed is might luck.
1.0	To put all into a nutshell, it is true that many peopel have the assertion that in the past it was easier to identify what type of carrer or jobs would lead to a secue, successful future due to the limitation of choice and eyesight.
1.0	Nevertheless, I strongly believe that people in the modern life will find a secure job and succeed.
3.0	As the pressure of learning becomes more and more, larger number of students lack of motivation to study harder.
3.0	For this, some of their supervisors would encourage children to have more motivation by giving them financial rewards if they get excellent grades or perform well at school.
11.0	In my view, I do not think it is a good way.
4.0	First of all, students will only concentrate on their high marks to get more money.
9.0	Learning is not only to perform well in the examination or obtain an extremely high grade, but also an enjoyable journey for a student to expand the knowledge or broaden the horizon.
9.0	In other words, students will neglect other good effects that learning may bring to and pay much attention on the marks that can satisfy their parents, instead of enjoying the process of learning.
4.0	Also, some non-beneficial effects can be lead to because of being offered money for great marks.
9.0	For example, besides the students who will make much efferts to reach a sucessful achievement, there are students who may cheat in the exam to obtain the high marks.
9.0	This would cause a serious bad habit to a student and can also make a bad influence on the rules of the school.
4.0	In addition, giving money reward is a bad choice for the future of the student.
8.0	What if they go to the university or go to work and do not have any more such rewards given by their parents?
8.0	They may lack of motivation to study or work.
8.0	As a result , it may make students depend on or rely on thier parents much when they study or work.
2.0	In conclusion, giving children such money rewards is bad for both their future study and self-dicinplined abilities, so I do noy agree.
3.0	If you are traveling with your family to one famous viewpoints in your country, and you are very familiar with the place, and you want to try more interesting projects in some other place, what will you choose between join a group lead by a guide or travel by yourself?
12.0	Obviously the last one!
11.0	Because the guide would lead you to the same places.
12.0	So I prefere to travel by yourselvs.
4.0	First, there is some problem in the trip which is led by the guide.
8.0	For example, there is a news in one country.
8.0	One guide lead a trip to the Thailand and the advertisement says that the guide will lead the visitors to a lot of places and have a lot of delicious foods.
8.0	So a lot of people join this group to travel in the Thailand.
8.0	And when they arrived, they suddenly find out that they are cheated by the advertisement.
8.0	"The guide leads them to several boring and bad places, and the guide drops them in many shopping malls and says that ""If you don't purching in the mall for some hours, I can't get enough money for my life."
8.0	"So if you don't shopping for some hours, I won't drive you back to your country!"""
8.0	This kind of things happens a lot in many countries, so that's the first reason for me to traveling by myself.
4.0	Second, if I choose to travel by myself, I could go for another places which is out of the famous points.
10.0	If I and my family want to travel in some city, if we choose the group, we couldn't stay in some places for long time, and if we want to view the point which is out of the travel list from the guide, we couldn't go to those places.
4.0	Third, someone would say that if you don't travel in the groups, you couldn't get enough information for the views.
9.0	But I think if you don't join the group, you could also get enough information for the web or some books.
9.0	And second, you could reduce the costs for the trip.
2.0	All in all, I think that traveling by ourselves is better than the trip which is under the guide's leading.
3.0	These days, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debates among people:which factor is most influencial on decision making.
3.0	From my perspective, recommendations from my friends or colleagues is the most important.
12.0	My point will be elaborated as follows.
5.0	Firstly, the information from my friends or colleagues is unbiased and is based on the truth.
8.0	Instead of  exaggerating the benefits of the products, the information from the friends is mainly based on their personal experience.
8.0	Aftering using the products for a while, friends can give a unbiasd evalution because they do not have any interests related to the products.
8.0	What friends or colleagues concerns is only the quality or performance of the product.
8.0	However, if relying on the information on the media, since the advertisment on the media only shows its benefits insteads of disadvantages, it would mislead you to buy it.
8.0	The salesman in the market also will persuade the customs to buy the products without showing its property or merely exaggerate the benefits because their job is saling the products as much as possible.
5.0	Secondly, the friends or clooeagues can give you the most suitable advice about the products.
8.0	Colleagues have worked with you for many years so they have a deep understanding of the person.
8.0	Based on the understanding, Friends and colleagues can recommend you with the suitable products, showing the goods they think you might perfer.
8.0	On the contrary, the information from the media  is target to any person who see the advertisment, so they cannot help you yo choose the suitable products from the various pattern.
8.0	Also the salesman would only base on the condition of perchase and tell you the best seller without pick a special one for you.
8.0	For example, last summer I bought a facial cleanser in the exclusive store.
8.0	Based on the persuaded that a product saled more than one hundred in a day, I bought it but it turn out to be sene
2.0	All in all,the recommendations from my friends or coleagues have reference value and can help me a lot.
11.0	I agree with the statement that people today are more willing to help the struggling strangers.
12.0	People in different eras may have different ideology.
12.0	I think people are very kind and warm-hearted nowadays.
5.0	Firstly,people' life can't be better than it used to be.
8.0	Except for some nations or areas,there is few starvation in the world up to now.
8.0	And most people don,t need to live a hard life anymore.
8.0	So when people don't have to think of those basic problems,they can be more considerate.
8.0	They are more willing to give hands to struggling strangers.
5.0	Secondly,the trust between people are more stronger in our society than before.
8.0	Now if a person can't be believed by most of people around him,it's difficult for him to live a good life.
8.0	He may encounter many barriers in his career or education.
8.0	Therefore people are more concern about their reputation today.
8.0	And the incidents that some people pretent to have difficulty to get symphothy form others and lie them take place fewer and fewer.
8.0	Thus people are more willing to do someone's a favor.
0.0	Thirdly,the atmosphere in our society is more splendid.
0.0	A social custom about helping others is being widly spread.
0.0	Once such infective action is down by an individual,fellows will follow him to give assistance to others.
7.0	For example,a study showed that 84% people didn't have the awareness of giving sea
12.0	Perhaps no one can avoid being influenced by mordern entertaining ways nowadays.
11.0	As personal computer and cellphones are more and more popular, people's ways to relax are changing greatly.
6.0	Many people prefer to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relaxing by doing physical exercise.
8.0	However, I totally disagree this view.
8.0	For one thing, doing physical exercise is good for our eyes.
8.0	Modern life style bring too much stress to our eyes, teenagers' eyesight is more terrible than before.
8.0	Our eyes can not afford it if we still watch TV or read books in our spare time.
8.0	For the other thing, a strong body is the basic of study and work.
8.0	"As the old saying goes, ""sharpening your axe will not delay your job of cutting wood."""
8.0	Therefore, doing physical exercise is necessary.
2.0	In conclusion, I stick to the point that it is better to relax by doing physical excercise than relax by watching a movie or reading a book.
3.0	In the modern soceity,  life is not very simple than before.
3.0	whether or not young peopple suppose to have the ability to plan and organize.
11.0	Some people think that young people need not have the ability to plan, some people claim that the best way for young people is to make a list and control themselves.
11.0	Personally, I believe that it is neccessary for young people to plan and organize, because they can learn a lot during that time.
5.0	Firstly, if young people know how to organize, they would have a lot of time to do other things that they like.
8.0	The ability that young people know how to plan and organize, they can save more time.
8.0	Due to the fact that, when they finish their work in certain time, they can use rest of time to do some other things which can relax or learn more knowlege.
8.0	Conversely, if young poeple have no capability to plan their time, they would not have a flexible time to do other things.
8.0	For example, people who work in art assignment, and this assignment due day is
5.0	Secondly, during that time, young people can make some new friends.
8.0	Young people suppose to have a lot of social communicate with other young people.
8.0	If they have that ability, maybe it is a good way to make them outstanding than other young people who are very ordinary.
8.0	For instance, people come to the young people's meeting, so there are a lot of young people who are the same in there.
8.0	However, if one of the young people have some ability that other young people they don't have, he or she is very different and excellent in other young people's eyes.
8.0	So that a lot of people want to make friend with
2.0	In conclusion, from my point of view, I believe that the ability for young people to organzie they should have, becaus it is a good way for young people to do whether they want in rest of time and make some new friends during that time.
3.0	Nowadays,people are more and more  likely to focus their children's study.
12.0	And some parents give their school-aged children money if they get high mark or grade in school.
12.0	A debate arises about whether parents should do this.
12.0	I agree with it because in this way parents can motivate their children to study hard and this method can help children to develop a good habit of spending money reasonablely.
4.0	To begin with,giving children money for high mark can motivate children to study hard in the school.
8.0	School children always want to get noney for what they love.
8.0	If their parents tell them that they can get money for high mark,they must study hard for the money.
8.0	Take my brother for example,he was not a student who love to study and his grade wasn't very well.
8.0	Last term,my mother told him that he can get one hundred yuan if he got an A in the English test.
8.0	He was excited and at that time,he came home on time everday and studied by himself.
8.0	Finally,he really got it!
8.0	It's my mom's money that motivate him to study hard.
4.0	In addition,offering money to children for good grade is beneficial for students to develop a good habit of how to spend money correctly.
8.0	Most parents will buy all of what the children need for them.
8.0	If the children can get some money,they will learn how to use the money correctly.
8.0	Take my brother for example,after getting her money,he always thought how to ues it.
8.0	And sometimes he will ask me about some prices of what he love,such as books,pens and so on.
8.0	Thus he would develop a good habit of how to use money.
4.0	Last but not the least,giving children money sometimes indeed will mislead children.
8.0	But in the long run,giving children money for high mark can help children develop good sense of money,and they will know that getting money is very difficult,so that they will value money.
8.0	What's more,the children will learn about how to use money is the best choice for them.
8.0	This way is beneficial for the chi
0.0	To sum up,i believe that offering children money for high grade or mark can really benefit children.
0.0	It is because in this way children are motivated to study hard.
0.0	What's more,children can develop a good habit of using money.
12.0	I think this is maybe a good idea,because i think the children need parent to support they to study  ,if they get a good grade ,i think parent can give they a little money,they will become better than before.
5.0	for example ,i have a friend ,she parent offer their school-age she money for each high grade they get in school.
8.0	Every exam her talk about she say : if you get  a good grade ,i can give you many money , but if you not get a good grade , get a bad grade , i can't give you money, so you need have good grade .
8.0	Then ,every exam she is very hard ,everytime she all have a little imporve ,her dad is very happy give she some money .
8.0	After,her mark more and more high ,her grade is very great.
8.0	So i think parent can offer their shool-age children money for each high grade they get in shool.
5.0	Another example, i listen to other people say ,she have many good grade because each exam she have good grade her parent can give she gift,she is very happy ,so she want have many gift ,so she hard to get good grade ,she want to her parent can guve she gift ,so every exam she have good grade .
8.0	So i think parent can offer their school-age children money or gift for each high grade they get in school.
8.0	This way can support childrent can get more high grade .
8.0	This is a good way .
7.0	So i think is a goo
7.0	id
11.0	I agree that parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.
11.0	Mistake is a great teacher of everyone.
12.0	Sometimes it comes from behavior, sometimes it begin with learning, and maybe other times it comes from the thinking.
9.0	Parents must let the children know why they made mistakes and how to solve them.
9.0	There are three type of the miatskes and let me anysis them respectively.
4.0	Firstly, a large scare of the mistakes which children made is from their behavior.
8.0	Because the children are very little, they do not know which is right or wrong.
8.0	So when they live a life or play with others, they may confused about what is really true.
8.0	In these scene, if parents abandon the children before they made, children can not get why they made this mistakes and how to aviod it next time.
4.0	Secondly, children always make mistakes when they are studying.
9.0	For example, if a child are doing his homework of math, he may makes some mistakes of it.
9.0	If now his parents told him why he made the mistake, he must remenber it and do not makes the same problem next time.
4.0	Thirdly, thinking mistakes is the most hidden one but the most important one.
9.0	If a child has some thinking mistakes and he do not aware that this thinking is false, this thinking mistake may belong this child for many years.
9.0	But if his parents can find this thinking problem and let the children aware that he is wrong, he will change is mind and correct this mistake.
2.0	So it is very important for parents let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes, by this way, they can get the reason why they made these mistakes and grow in a better way.
12.0	With he rapid development of society,an incrreasing number of people tend to be faced with much pressure in working and studying.
12.0	So it is high time for us to slow down and relax ourselves.
11.0	From my perspective,I think the best way of relaxing is to do physical exercise.
12.0	It is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than realx by doing physical exercise
4.0	First of all,as is known to us,doing exercise can make peope getting stronger and stronger.
10.0	It means that doing phyical exercise can not only help us relax,but also make us healthy.
4.0	Secondly,when you are doing physical exercise,you are bound to consume much energy.
9.0	After that,you will find exhausted and tired,which can also let you be more relaxed.
9.0	According to these physical exercise,for example,there are basketball,football,volleyball and so on,you can best use up all of your energy and thus all of your pressure,your sadness will disappear in the end.
4.0	Lastly,although you can also relax yourself by watching a movie or reading a book,your relax is just result from the exciting story,which can make us pleasant for a moment.
9.0	However after watching or reading,you will get nervous as the same as before watching or reading it.
9.0	In a word,this way is temporary,but oppsitely,th exercise can let the feeling of relax last longer.
4.0	What is more,the way of doing physical exercise has more advantages than watching or reading.
10.0	The former way I mention are both physical and mental,and the latter way is only mental.
2.0	From what has been discussed above,it can be concluded that it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than realx by doing physical exercise.
11.0	I do not agree with the saying that it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.
11.0	In the first place, people are supposed to relax by focusing on others rather the part that are tired.
12.0	Nowadays, people feel tired more bacause their brains or minds are running out rather than they really get exausted physically.
12.0	In this way, if people still use their brains to watch a movie or read a book, there will be no doubt that they can not feel relaxing.
5.0	Secondly,in such a society, what can make people relax is exactly the physical exercise.
8.0	That is to say, the way of real relax can't be staying somewhere quietly.
8.0	As time goes by, things change.
8.0	It is obvious that it is much better to do sports than to stay there for relax.
8.0	Thus, the more you keep quiet, the more tired you will feel.
8.0	Doing exercises is the key to making people relax.
5.0	In the third place, doing sports can improve people's health.
8.0	In modern society, an increasing number of people are getting unhealthier than before.
8.0	And, it is most derived from the ways of working and living today.
8.0	People tend to be working for all day long in sitting way.
8.0	Lacking enough exercises, there is no wonder they are in a bad health.
8.0	Watching a movie or reading a book can not help promote the physical health at all.
0.0	When we consider something, we really should do it with the date and situation.
0.0	After all, things are always changing.
0.0	Of course, according to the modern world, it is better to relax by doing physical exercise than watching a movie or reading a book.
12.0	Yes, I compeletely agree with the statement that the television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
8.0	These are the reasons of it is that, in the human society, the children and the kids are the purest members of a human's family.
8.0	But in today's world, some companies Advertising the advertisment of the children only for much more money.
8.0	I think this kind of actions are the shame of the human's society.
8.0	If  one child's parents are watching TV, suddnely, they see the child of them, can you image their moods?
8.0	On the other hand, if you are the parents, what will you do if you see the
11.0	In my opinion, I think it is a good idea and I have some reasons to support my point.
12.0	Admitedly, children is too young to contorl their own mind.
12.0	Maybe some children will use their money to play compular  games or buy some toys.
11.0	Those behaviors are not good.
8.0	If children spend their money on playing they would waste the money that their parents earned hardly.
8.0	If children have some school-age money they would not study hard as before.
8.0	This result is not expected.
8.0	However, children will need money to do some necessery things such as buying textbooks, eating snacks, taking the subway and drinking soda-pops.
8.0	If children do not have money to do these, they will feel upset and envy.
8.0	For examle ,when I was ten years old, my parents did not give me money.
8.0	Once I finished my school work and i was really thirsty, but I did not had any money than I saw other children had money to buy something they want, at that moment I was really admire them .
6.0	In addition, Children can save time if they have money.
8.0	For example, if the teather give you a task that to buy a textbook,  and you also have money than youcan buy it soonly, you do not need to go back to your home, to ask your mom to give you   money and to go to the shop.
8.0	You can save a lot of time about this.
8.0	And that time you saved, you can use it for sutdying,relaxing and playing with friends.
8.0	That is really useful to keep your body friendship and mental stornger.
2.0	In short, I think it is a good idea that children should take some money and parents should give them the money.
12.0	Resently, an interesting topic has aroused a heated discussion:nowadays children need to be given spend more time on their own favorites, for it will benefit to their growth.
11.0	however, I disagree with it.
11.0	In my opinion, there are no necessary to spend more time doing what they want.
6.0	Firstly, spending more time on homework make it possible for children to become talent and successful.
8.0	As we know, it is important standard to judge children from their academic ability and and related information, therefore more time on doing homework can help them to get a better assessment.
8.0	Learning knowledge and practicing reatives can not only incresing their knowledge but also geting in touch new things from organized activities.
8.0	during the process of learning Secondly, doing more organized activities can help children gain more experience growing with grops.
8.0	What's more, they can benefit from the unique school activities.
8.0	For instance, my school always organizes students to study overseas during vacation and I went to England to study for 2 months last year.
8.0	Although we can learn the forign culture in the text books, some  knowiedge gain from getting touch with local people will never appear only in books.
8.0	From this abroad studing, I extended my field of vision,and get more life experience.
8.0	So spending more time on attending organized acticities will help children make full ues of times and fullful their life.
0.0	Admittedly, alowing more time for children to do whatever they want have some advantages, for interests is the best teacher for children, if children spend time learning what they are interested in, it will ignite their passion.
0.0	Also, children's interest should be respect.
0.0	However, what I want to suggest is that sometimes childrens choice migt be blind faith and erroneous, such as some children addicted to playing computer games.
0.0	Therefore parents should lead and take charge of them.
12.0	As the more elder people are become the main parts, which could dominate the trendency of the societ,  of the community, some people begin to think the young people begin to lose the chance to determine the future of the society.
11.0	But for my opinion, the yonger people still play an important role in today's community.
4.0	First and foremost, the lastest technology which is aquired many energy to study is leaded by the young people.
8.0	At the same, the technology is the most important part which is concerned to the future of a country.
8.0	One of my school mates, who is seven years older than me, get a job in a Internation company.
8.0	In this company he could get a chance to research on the trendency of 5G.
8.0	This project has a vital position in the future of a contry.
4.0	Besides, yonger people have more method to solve a problem which could hardly understand by old people.
8.0	As for one of my friend, who is studying in a good University, once he had a different idea of a problem.
8.0	After that he refered to many book and spend many time on studying the methord.
8.0	In the end, he provided a completely different thought of how to print the date in a system the professor majored.
4.0	last but not the least, although old people could get the domination of some trendency of the society, younger also have the ability to affect the mass.
8.0	As people want to get more knowledge, more and more yonger people begin to write the script.
8.0	In the society more and more novel enter people's daliy life.
8.0	In a date the yongers is a important part of the writers nowadays.
3.0	In most cases,some people take it for granted that parents offer their school-age children money for each grade they get inschool.
12.0	While others do not think so,they reckon that it sounds reasonable but materialistic,therefore,not good for children's mental development.
12.0	"As for me,despite the adventure of being titled as ""absolutist"",I will consistently support that school-age children should be rewarded for their progress on studies."
6.0	Maybe a lot of people stress the suspect of the authenticity of my point of view,but what I want to demonstreate is ,this idea has been certified by experience from those who are outstanding in their career.
7.0	For instance,Ashley,a
3.0	As the society advances into a new period, increasing number of new things occur in our life; thus, obviously people's life nowadays become more complex than the past.
11.0	In this situation, the ability to plan and organize is more important for young people.
5.0	In the first place, the ability to plan and organize never fail to put the cornerstone for the future achievements for young people who need to obtain more well-rouded skills in order to be dorminated in the complex working situation.
8.0	As we advance into a international period, it is common to enter a international company.
8.0	If young people can make a splash in this international condition, he not only need languague skills to communicate with foreign people, but also need to cultivate more interest such as piano or playing basketball.
8.0	In order to equip young people these advantages before they enter the soceity, it is essential for them to obtain the ability to do exact scheme including all of these events.
8.0	Only in this way, they can both consider the study grade and these additional skills.
8.0	Therefore, the ability to plan and organize is essential ingredient for young people's future achievements.
5.0	Secondly, to obtain the ability to plan and organize for young children can help them learn how to make other employees and working condition more organized in the future.
8.0	My brother James used to list all events he need finish one day and then follow the list to finish each part.
8.0	When he set up his own company after he graduate, he help his employees planning their own events and even planed exact company progress in one years.
8.0	James can operate company so successfully owing to the fact that he have the ability to plan and orgaize everything well and follow them exactly.
8.0	This exellent ability help him making company and employees organized.
1.0	Finally the ability to plan and organize can even have positive impacts on our physical and psychological health owing this ability can provide more time for young people to relaxed and communicate with others.
1.0	In the past, I almost have no time to relaxed because I always have no plan to do anything.
7.0	Later, when I organize my life well, I always can reserve time to communicate with my family me
3.0	Maybe this is a not good idea.
12.0	Because to my mind,my parents give me a good grades plenty time.
11.0	They told me that grades is not very important and the importance of study is that your attitude.
12.0	If you are intersted in studing or learning,you will try your best to do that,and spend your alomost time to do it to keep your grades good by yourslfe.
4.0	So that,the question of ''some parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.''are make them to do it wihout doing it by themselves.
9.0	And they may to copy others homework tests,they may think their parents will give them money,and they must do it well.
9.0	If they whithout thinking tiwce to copy others ,they will be more and more bad.
4.0	This will not help them to be more carefully in study,this will make them more lazy and give them rely.
9.0	If you don't give them money one day,do you promise your children will give you the good grades as usaL?
9.0	I think the answer to the question is no！
10.0	Why?
4.0	Because your children get your money that time,they will like that feeling.
9.0	They can buy things they want by themselves,they can show the money they had to their friends.
9.0	Thet want to keep this thing,so they must keep getting good grades.
4.0	You just want to give your tired baby a gift,but you don't konw haw lazy greedy or self-regulation they are.
9.0	Please don't do that every time.
9.0	Please don't make your children to like showing off.
1.0	If you want your children more clever,just give them your encourage!
1.0	Trt to belive your child.
3.0	I disagree the view that it's better to relax by whatching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.
5.0	The twenty-first centry is an area during which people undertaking more and more tasks and speedy working schedules.
9.0	Thus,a large mount of people chose relax themselves by watch a movie or read a book rather than by doing physical exercises.
9.0	However,it's bad for our physical health.
5.0	First and formost,It's well known that physical exercise could lighten the burden we took in our daily life.
8.0	After whole day's working,doing some physical exercises could help us breath fresh air and relax our tired eyes.
8.0	Moreover,it's a good chance to go outdoor and make more friends.
2.0	we can't deny that watching a movie or reading an interesting book could make us happy psychologically
8.0	In conclution,
3.0	With the development of the society,peole more and more are requied improving their enfficency.
3.0	Espercally in our work and study.
11.0	So it is neccessary finding a good way to study more effectively.
12.0	I think it more useful that the students must work together with teachers when they assign projects on.
5.0	First of all,student will more impress after assin projects with they teachers.
8.0	If they assign the project with their teachers,teachers  will more know about their students' problems and accroding their problem to theach them.
8.0	So work with students when teachers assian projects ,theachers can improve themself teaching ability and the student  also can solve their problems.
8.0	This is good for both.
5.0	In adittion,working together with their students is good for increase the chance of communicate.
8.0	Most of the time ,teacher do not know about their students .
8.0	People are emotional animals,accroding the way they can impress each other more comprehensive.
8.0	Therefore reduce their aging gap.
8.0	The evironnmental will more advantage.
0.0	Maybe students  working alone on projects is disadvantages for their independent ability.
0.0	They may more and more relate their theachers.
0.0	However,it is more important for learning konwledge for them.
0.0	In this society ,time is very expensive.
10.0	So we have no choice ,we have to adapt the evironnment and find the most fast way to improve our skills and ability.
7.0	Therefore ,improving our
3.0	As the information period advanced, it is prettey easy for us to see a myriad kind of city presidents' measures and some potitics' publications.
3.0	Obviously, people will have they own perspectives for those and lots of teachers are willing to share their own social or political views with classmates.
12.0	However, I am into tune that teachers are not supposed to do that.
4.0	In the first place, that teachers point out their own thoughts on politicy and society will decrease the efficiency of courses.
8.0	For instance, my math teachers always discuss the measures of president in our city such as removing the city park and increasing the electronic tax.
8.0	Furthermore, He always assesses the advantages and disavantages brought by these behaviors; for example, people lose a place to relaxe themselve and increasing tax will bring larger life pressur.
8.0	In this way, all classmates are unsatisfied with him owing to the fact that it is a waste time for us to spend half class to listen his own opinion about these political events.
8.0	Because of his political ideas, we never be imported full knowledge on class and all students obtain a bad grade on math.
8.0	Therefore, to avoid low efficiency in class, teachers are not supposed to point out their own political thoughts.
4.0	Secondly, teachers' political and social knowledge is may not well-rounded and they mislead students sometimes with their own ideal for policy or society.
8.0	In the past, my borther,Daniel, hated Japan because his teacher always described that Japaness are bad people and their violence makes their courtry failure.
8.0	However, Daniel totally changed his idea about Japan after he had a travel to there.
8.0	He told me that people there were pretty respectabal and well; furturemore, Japan has strong technology power and economy advantage.
8.0	All of these good characteristics are not discribed by his teacher and there are lots of thing we need study from them.
8.0	Therefore, maybe his teacher never go to that courntry and just listened some fake information.
8.0	Thus, teachers should not spread their own political or social opinions because they are maybe incorrect information.
4.0	In my opinion, there is no better way to cultivate students with well-rounded insight about politicy and society than telling them the fact of events and provide them freedom space to independently think.
9.0	Owing to the fact that different students have different characteristic and thinking from different angle will obtain different results, teachers should only tell their students the truce of political and social events without any bias.
9.0	This way, students can use their own experience and knowlege to justice these events.
2.0	To sum up, I totally disagree with that teachers point out their own perspectives of social and political events.
3.0	There is a increasing trend that parents are willing to award their school-aged children with money if they get a high mark.
3.0	Parents are in favor of this idea for it effectively encourage student to study.
11.0	But I insisit that this is not a good idea.
5.0	The award money will not serve as a stimulus for study, instead, it distract children from study.
8.0	They no longer study for their interest or their eager to learn knowledge, and they just focus on money.
8.0	This behavior changes their aim of study, from learning to gaining money.
8.0	This money awarding betray the esece of spiritual education.
8.0	For example, the money award may encourage the students interest in spending money and take earning money as their goal of learning.
8.0	The better solution is to give children books instead to encourage them explore the unknowns.
5.0	What the parents should award is not only the hgh grade,but also the progress.
8.0	Parents should not only demand high mark,but also prase for the progress children made.
8.0	For instance, if a student has a poor mark at beginning and  make progress through dignant efforts,but he failed to get reward for hard to meet the high standard parents want,he would cetainly lose heart to study.
8.0	This is not the parents want,but is caused by parents award.
8.0	So it is better for the parents to offer money for each progress children made in school instead of the high grade.
8.0	This is what  many top universities are managing to do now.
0.0	In summary, offering money for each high grade, to some extent, will encourage children to study harder.
0.0	But to think about the deeper influnce, this is not a good idea for it actually kill the interest of learning.
0.0	I prefer a better solution that parents could reward children for the progress they made at school and change the money into the book.
0.0	This will be a better stimulus for study.
12.0	When we feel tired it doesn't means our body  need relax  but our brain doesn't want to work .
8.0	I am a student of senior high school which means I have to keep on studing for hours  and just have few hours for rest everyday,I will get tired and don't want move when I got home .
8.0	That's why I prefer to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing phyisical exercise .
8.0	But for those  who have many time for relaxing ,I think they can relax themselves  by watching movies and reading books ,if it works then they can back to work again.
8.0	But if they had  relaxed for a long time and still feel stressful ,they'd better do some exercise to relese their body                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               For diffrent stuation we should choose diffrent way to relax .
8.0	For example ,after finished a 1500m-running race ,you won't chose exercise for relaxing .
8.0	If you had finished an test and that makes you feel stressful ,do some exercise may be the better choice .
11.0	I think it's not a good idea because the remark can lead the students feel the life it's to win for the money.
11.0	It can also lead the students think that the goal of the life is to win the money.
11.0	It will lead students to see things depending on money,not on the things.
4.0	For students,we should lead them to study better ,not to make them think the life is to be tested on how much you have.
9.0	When students all think how to make money ,who will spend lots of time to conquer a big problem ,who will do thse tiny but vital things,and who will help others?
9.0	When i happen, what can we do?
4.0	What‘s more,the thought will also weaken the goal and the willingness they have.
8.0	When the brain wave like this came, people would think that to be a solider is very useless and costing, which will lead the coutry lacking people to defect the confilcts ,the war and the natural disasters.
8.0	When all these come true,what will happen?
8.0	The coutry will be deafeted ,the people will run away and the finance will not exist any more.
4.0	last,but not the least,he thought wlii makr our society feel like a cold society without the beautiful frendiship.
8.0	To sum up, I think it's not  a good idea that some parents offre their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.
8.0	The life shouldn't   tested by life and our students shouln't think life is our life goal.
8.0	When think it, we will see that the life will be, what the socuety wil be ,what the country will be ang what the wolrld will be.
8.0	There will be wars ,tne illness, the laziness and so on.
7.0	I don't agree ,because I don't want the life to be like tha
3.0	With the rapid pace of the society, many people seem to be increasingly busy.
3.0	Different ages of people face various problems--- elder people suffer in physical disorders and students are under the high pressure of study.
3.0	Hence, people may not have enough time to company with their extended family.
12.0	In my opinion, in the recent years, the extended family is less important than it was in the past.
5.0	Initially, since people can extend their social network by internet communication, they do not need to limit their relationship in the extended family.
8.0	In the past time of China, becasue of the lack of internet communication, people have less chances to make more friends other than the relatives, and even just the friends of the extanded family members.
8.0	However, people can just stay at home and commute with other people through long distance by the social media.
8.0	Thus, people nowadays do not need to strengthen the relationship between the relatives but making friends with the people who have common values or interests.
5.0	Moreover, the amount of work can cause the emotional gap between the extended family, thus reducing the frenquency of communication.
8.0	In the past of Chine, a big family including the extended family lived in a large yard together.
8.0	Although people were not direct- blooded family members, the living convention cause people are familiar with relatives.
8.0	Compare to the modern society, people live and work in different places.
8.0	With the lack of communication, the relationship is not as close as before.
0.0	Finally, people can be more independent than before, so the extended family is not important now.
0.0	In the past, people only could get imported products when some relatives went broad, but now is changed.
0.0	As the ebay exists, people can easily buy things they want just click a button on the website.
0.0	In this case, the extended family is less helpful than before.
11.0	I do not think it is a great idea to just let chlidren make mistakes and learn from them.
12.0	Instead of concidering it as lessons from mistakes as most chinese peaple does, I think it hurts the children that suffers from the mistake a lot.
11.0	To be simple, I think the benifits is way less than the negative affects it will cost.
4.0	First of all , not preventing children from mistakes may cause the lack of happiness and safetiness.
8.0	Children's hearts are young and vulnurable.
8.0	Unprevented harm like unstopped mistakes may let the child adopt  fear  to the outside world , for it brought him so much unhappiness and horrible memories.
8.0	I think it is well against the idea of the development of a healthy mind.
8.0	This will cause the Child to be senseative and afraid to think of new ideas , for the ones that make the first step has his fate unknown.
8.0	Just imagine it , if someone gets something bad all the time from trying new things and doesn't get any guidance or support, who would ever dare to da anything new?
4.0	In the other hand , it may even cause a negative feeling to the outside world .
8.0	A Child's mind is like a piece of white paper.
8.0	What you print on it is what it will look like and what it will become.
8.0	The good will be adopted if printed the good and also bad things will occur if bad things are printed.
8.0	Giving children a negative feeling to the world at such a young age really sucks because it may easily leave an impression in their mind that tells them that the world doesn't love them.
8.0	And as a result, what the child grows up to think about is to hate the world.
8.0	Never make chlidren feel they are born in a cruel world.
8.0	Make them think of the bright side and let them develop towads it.
4.0	But as the wise always say‘every coin has two sides’.
8.0	There is benifits of letting children make mistakes.
8.0	Firsst , it can teach them to be careful , think before they act.
8.0	And it can also make them brave and more able to face future difficultes.
0.0	Nothing is perfect , so is the act of preventing or not preventing children from mistakes.
0.0	The thing can't really be perfect , but  what we do about it can mean a lot .
0.0	So a balance between preventing too much and absolutely not preventing should be the best option.
0.0	It's not good to just prevent such things , but there is obviously no good to not prevent it.
3.0	Nowadays, education has become a hot topic in our society and people pay far more attention to education than before.
3.0	It is common for parents to concern that thier children will be influenced by other people and whether students are more influenced by their teachers or their friends has been debated.
3.0	Some people believe that teachers influence students more because they give courses and knowledge to students, while other people believe that students are easily influenced by their friends because they spend more time with their friends.
12.0	From my perspective, students are more influences by their friends.
4.0	First, young children have more topics with there peers.
8.0	Friendships will be easily established between teenagers whose age are near the same and who share similar hobbies and interests with them, probably about singers, movie stars or some sports.
8.0	That is to say, they tend to spend much time together, discussing all the things that they are interested.
8.0	And during this process, they may influenced each other, from which sport team to support to how to spend the holidays.
8.0	Finally, their personalities and future careers may even be deeply affected by their friends.
4.0	Second, students are prone to act like the one of his friends that are respected in their group.
10.0	Every child has the hope to be respected, even just by several of his friends, and the simplest way is to imitate the one that seems successful in the group.
4.0	Admittedly, teachers do have an strong influence on their students.
8.0	However, the time students spend with teachers is limited, compared with those with their friends.
8.0	That makes a deeper influence impossible because students may just sit in the classroom and listen to their teachers.
8.0	Students learn knowledge from their teachers, but there seems no more intimate relationships would generate.
7.0	All in all, student are more influenced by their friends because they have more common topics
3.0	Currently, there is a hot debate on whether government should improve the safety or improve the appearance to attract tourists.
3.0	Perspectives vary from people to people.
3.0	Someone claims that these action is futile and costly.
11.0	However, in my opinion, it is vital to improve the safety and improving appearence.
10.0	The reason is elaborated as follows.
6.0	First, the safety can be an adventage over other attractions to attract tourists.
8.0	Vacation is a way to release people's presure and no one want their vaction to touble themselves.
8.0	As a result, tourist always priortizes the safety and are concerned about the criminal rate of the city.
8.0	Thus, improviny security is really critical.
8.0	What is more, more police engaged means that tourist can get a better sevice.
8.0	For example, if they have strayed, they can ask police for help.
8.0	As for my family, we are really concerned about the security.
8.0	Whenever we go to a city, we will check its criminal rate and avoid go to with region with a high rate.
1.0	Second, appearance is crucial to attract tourists.
1.0	One of the reason that tourists go there is to enjoy the beautiful scene of the city and tourists always prefer sanitary place.
7.0	Nowadays, almost everyone live in a rapidly development society, pwoplw always need to do many jobs everyday to feed themsevles and in my opinion, workers are not ,ore satisfied when they have many different types of tasks to do during the workday than when they do similar tasks all day long,
4.0	Firstly, that is not possible that a people good at everything, many people just can do one job.
8.0	If athe people do many different types of jobs in a day, they may can not have a good expression because they only can do one job well.
8.0	For example.
8.0	my mother is a accoutant in a company, her only job is make sure the money in her company is safe and make sure everyone can get their money every mouth on time, if one day her boss let her do do some other job that she does not know how to do such as communicate with ther customers, she can not do it well because she does not know how she can do.
4.0	Secondly, when people only do one job duriong the workday, they may can do that job better.
10.0	as we know, we need to pay attention to waht our doing now when we do something, if workers have many different types of tasks yo do during a workday, they must continue move their attention to many other place, when you just fell yourself do onething well, you need to do to de a other tasks, then in the end of the day, you are not finish anything well.
4.0	Fianlly, everyone have their own interest, when they do what they like, they will have more enthusiasm for the job than other people.
8.0	In my opinion, people always choose their jobs by what they like, when they do the job that they like, they will have more enthusiasm for their job.
8.0	If they do many kinds of different tasks one day, there must have some jobs which they do not like, so they can not do those jobs well.
8.0	Foe example, when i have to do some math work, i totally do not want to do because i am not interest in math, in the end, i just full of the block but i have mistakes almost every questions.
2.0	All in all, in my opinion, workers are more satisfied when they can do the similar tasks during the workday than they have many kinds of tasks to do all day long because they will finish jobs better, have more enthusiasm and have a strong point in their jobs.
11.0	I disagree that it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relsx by dong physical exercise.
11.0	In my opinion, we have our own way which is suitable for ourselves best to relax, and we can not easily say that some ways are better than others.
6.0	Someone like doing physical exercise to relsx, maybe he/she used to paly sports ,it will make him/her happy.
8.0	And he/she can easily fall in sleep after exercise so that he/she can get a best relax  .
8.0	But the others may not think so, they would rather to have a rest just like watching a movie or reading a book than do some exercise, because they don not want to make themselves more tried.
8.0	So how we can say that it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than reiax by doing physical exercise?
8.0	Everyone shuold find the way which is the must suitable for themselves rather than the best way which is said by others.
2.0	All in all, there is no best way to rela
11.0	I think it is good for our study.
11.0	As we all know,we students need our own money which can paid for supper and drinking and so on.
12.0	When this way that help us incress our grades are put up with,I was support it.
4.0	Sometimes we may be addicted to many games and take less attention to the study.
8.0	In this situation,there are no use to try any else ways to help them.
8.0	We just need something can pick their attention instead of what they are favorite games.
8.0	And I think gades and money are the same.
8.0	It can not only tell them they need to put themselfves to the study,but also tell them some social things:your grades better,you work better,your money more.
4.0	SO as far as I know,many parents have had used this way to keep their kids far away from bad things.
8.0	But I need to tell you what the most opinion of mine is NOT TO BE CRAZY.
8.0	It is just a way,not a punishment,we can not punish them by decrease money.
8.0	Becease it will have no use to let kids do well.
4.0	For example,my freind Chen was very bad at school when he was young.
8.0	Although he was clever,he did not get good grades.
8.0	He played games,did not listen to our teacher.
8.0	After his parents uesd that way.
8.0	Not only did he realize the importence of money,but also get good grades.
2.0	All in all,it is a good way to make us study better.
12.0	Nowadays, many parents give the money to their children who get the high marks as a reward.
3.0	Actually, it's a excellent method to educate the children.
11.0	And also, the children will be encouraged by the reward of the money.
12.0	It's important for the parents to give such a award to the children to encourage them to continue the study.
10.0	There are three reasons for the topic.
4.0	Firstly, children will get a lot of courage from the award given by the parents.
8.0	When the children get the high marks, the parents will give the money as the award for the good scores.
8.0	The children will know that his hard-working of the study deserves the award and he will get many confidence and courage to study harder and harder.
8.0	When I was forteen, I got very good scores and got the third position of the class.
8.0	My parents gave me much money as an award.
8.0	At that time, I felt that the months of the hard work was given back the good outcome.
8.0	So I got much courage from the award of the parents.
8.0	I felt so confident about myself.
4.0	Secondly, parents will establish a better relationship with the children.
8.0	Of course, the parents can decide not to give the children money to award the high marks.
8.0	The children will consider that the parents don't feel as good as the children themselves.
8.0	The children will feerl depressed about their parents.
8.0	There will be a gap between the parents and children.
8.0	So it's important for the parents to reward the children.
8.0	The children will think that their parents are also happy because of the high marks.
4.0	Thirdly, the children will know about the benifit of the study.
0.0	Many students don't like study becaouse of the very young age.
0.0	If the parents give them award to encourage them because of the good scores.
0.0	They will know the benifit of the study and they will study well at the next time to gain the benifit again.
10.0	A
3.0	Nowadays, in university, many teachers have their own project, and they often assign it to students, which cause a great deabt that whether students should work together or work alone have a higher efficient.
11.0	As for me, I think it's better to work in group.
5.0	First, work in group can be easier than work alone, a group contains many students from different majors.
8.0	So they can use their different knowledge to solve a problem together.
8.0	As for me, I joined a model car compitation with my friends, who come from various majors, and we work together to make a model car.
8.0	i major in machine industrial, so I focus on the connection of those compoement.
8.0	My teammate Tom, who is major in computer science, he take response of programming, and Alex, whose major is material, he help us find a suitble case for our car.
8.0	And finally, we get a good grades in the compitation.
8.0	And one of my classmates, whose acdemic performance is better than all of my teammates, but he works along, and get nothing in the end.
5.0	Second, work in group can help you to improve your work efficiency, once you want to have a rest in you work time, your teammates will remind you to keep working.
8.0	Serval monthes ago, I take part in a math competation.
8.0	I worked with two teammates in the self study room.
8.0	After about 2 hours, i felt a little tired, and I want to take a sleep.
8.0	"When I was about to sleep, my teammates hit my back, said:""your work is not over, we have to work togetther to finish it."""
8.0	His words gave me power, and they are waiting for my consult to contine their works, so I refreshed myself, devoted my in working, and finish the task on time.
8.0	If i don't have my teammates, I might fall asleep and missed the deadline.
8.0	So, it is teammate that helps me to overcome the difficulties.
0.0	Above all, working together can be easier because we have more ideas and solution, and a group also make you a higher effieiency people.
0.0	All of which can lead you and your group to success.
0.0	So why don't you find your own group and work together?
11.0	Nowadays,  people have many tasks that need them to finish.
10.0	For example, adults are busy with their own work, and stidents need to study several different courses, so they have got to do many things in the same time, but the reaults of it is they just can do few tings well.
4.0	First, when people do many different works, their attentions will be distracted.
8.0	For example, when I was a senior high school students, I need to study several different couses, and after the class, I need to finish the homework of these course.
8.0	But when I do these homework at home, I usually do one course's homework.
8.0	but I still tink about other homeworks, even I spend a whole day to study these course, but my homwork still finished badly, because my attention is eaisly to be distracted, and in that time, I usually feel tired and busy, so the next homework I cannot do well.
4.0	Second, because we need to do many diifferent things, it will add us pressure invisiblely, so our emotion cannot be calm, and we feel tired or mad easily, and all of it has bad inflence on our efficiency.
9.0	For example, one day, many relatives will come to my home to attend my birthday party, so my mother will do many houseworks, such as wash the window, sweep the floor, flood the clothes and many things like that.
9.0	So my mother do these houseworks in all day, but because the housework is too much, although my mother  try  her best to do it, the result still cannot satisfactory, because my mother suffer too much pressure, so her spirit will be run out off quickly, and her body will feel tired too.
4.0	Finally, confronting these many different things, it is hard for people to keep a clear mind.
9.0	When they confront these things, they have got to use their brain to come up with a method to solve this problem, but they hardly to figure it out, because of too much tings, maybe their brain cannot absorb this information clearly, so they cannot deal with this in efficient ways.
9.0	Although they look like work hard, the real results is not ideal.
12.0	As far as i am concerned, people today are note willing to help the struggling strangers.
8.0	At first, China is a rapiid developing country with a acute social problem arising that new thinkings and thoughts are confliicting against traditional Chinese customs.
8.0	Most people in China are confused and forced to get used to the high-speed pace of social development.
8.0	The pararmount concerrn for the most is how to earn enough salary to make a living, so other things are put aside.
8.0	When someone is in trouble, people around are not sure whether he or she have responsibility to help him or her, and if he help him, whether he himself will get into another trouble.
8.0	That is why people today in China are not willing to help de struggling strangers.
6.0	As we all know, Chinese people are willing to help someone in trouble before.
8.0	But there was a man called Peng Yu, once a time he helped an elder woman who fell down on the street.
8.0	What is dramatic and annoying is that the woman is a deceiver.
8.0	She insisted that Peng is the one who hit her down on the street.
8.0	Everyone knows the fact but the court anouced that Peng is guilty.
8.0	After that, nobody in China have courage to help someone in trouble, especially elders who falls down on the street.
8.0	One day, an elder man who had a heart attack fell down on the street, but nobody called the ambulance and the elder man passed away.
11.0	I don't think watching a movie or reading a book is a better way than doing physical exercise for relax.
12.0	They both can take a rest and ease your nerve and leave your work for a whil,But their mechanism differs.
12.0	Watching movies and reading books are ways of mental relaxation,while doing sports like basketball and football is a process to physically relax your body,exercising muscle stimulate your brain to make you happy.
5.0	One reason that I disagree is what I do on usual days.
10.0	I'm a student and on ordinary times I'll study with my brain mostly,so I need to do physical exercise my brain to produce hormone,which can let you be more optimistic on daily work in reture.
5.0	another reason why I choose to do physical exercise is that I can communicate with others when I'm exercising.
10.0	Talking and playing with my friends  promote my social skills and satisfy the need of social contact.
3.0	Nowadays, people have many relaxed and learning knowledge ways, such as reading books, watching movies and so on.
12.0	Many people contends that the books and movies both give me us a virual world.
12.0	However, I have different idea.
12.0	I agree with the statement that we can learn about a person who come from the books and movies.
12.0	There are some reasons why I feel this way: we can learn about a person who is my friends or my families by wacthing the movies or reading the books.
6.0	First of all, we wacth a character from the movies that we often think of myself.
9.0	when people watch the good movies, they will get addicted to roles.
9.0	we will follow the role of the passions to happy or sad.
3.0	Nowadays, in order to encourage children to get good grades in school, some parents choose to reward their children with money when they get high marks.
11.0	It is undeniable that there are certain advantages in doing so, but in my opinion, there are more bad influence in the future.
5.0	First of all, there is nothing wrong with parents' behavior.
8.0	Their purpose is to motivate their children to study hard and get good grades.
8.0	In fact, their behavior does have effect in the short run, and children often tend to work hard to achieve parents' expectations.
8.0	In this way, not only the parents feel gratified, but also the children who are rewarded with money will be very happy.
5.0	However, this is not a long-term solution.
9.0	Onthe one hand, soon or later, children will feel tired of it, and when they are no longer interested in money, parents' reward will lose their attraction to them, and they will lack the motivation to learn and may become lazy in study.
9.0	On the other hand, parents may make their children interested only in money, too much interest in money many have a bad impact on the quality of their children, but aslo affect the
11.0	I do not agree with the statement that movies and televisions have more negative effects than positives effects on the way young people behave.
12.0	My reasins are the below.
4.0	First, the appear of the movies and the televisions could generate more art and culture's forms.
8.0	In the past, there were not any products what are like the TV.
8.0	That's because the technology was so lost.
8.0	In that time, the people who wants to watch the drama or any other things, the people would go out and then walk for long time and go to the theater.
8.0	Finally, he goes to the theater successfully and to competeting with other people on buying the tickets.
8.0	Then he successfully get the ticket but he must take the seat in a tiny seat.
8.0	However, we have the TV, and we can also watch the drama when we sitting on our sofa, and we could enjoy much more things.
4.0	Second, the movies are also an important form of the art.
9.0	In the ages which do not have the movies, the people couldn't watch the TV and they could only go to the theater and watch the drama and go to the audioism and listen to some music which played by the actors.
9.0	They will feel bred if they watch too much and listen too much.
4.0	Third, because we have the TV and the movies, we could using a lot form of the entertainments.
8.0	Because we have the TV and the movies, we could enjoy the life and we could spend our time on these enjoyable things.
8.0	Because we have the TV, we could know the news of the world and we can also appereciate the beautiful views around the world.
8.0	Because we have the movies, we could watch the things which is we imagined.
2.0	That's why we could have the happier life.
3.0	In our country there has always been a spirit of volunteerism.
3.0	As children,we are taught that helping those less fortunate is our responsibility.
3.0	But unfortunately,the growing prospreity of the nation has placed an emphasis,creating a generation of youth that do not understand the meaning of being selfless.
11.0	I believe young people today are not as charitable as previous generations of young people.
5.0	The main reasons I am so skeptical of the inclination of today's youth to help people is that they are spoiled.
8.0	I remember when I was young and using a computer at the public librery was a privilege.
8.0	When my parents bought me my own computer when I went to university,I understood how much they sacrificed to give me that as a present.
8.0	They do not know what it is to be without.
5.0	In addition to respect others.
9.0	Traooed in their own digital world,they are unaware of the disrespect they show their elders when they ignore their parents and grandparents as they text and talk on their cellphones.
9.0	Maybe that is not the sole cause,but I see a distinct difference between how they behave and how my generation behaved at that age.
2.0	Today's youth,who have been raised in a period of affluence and privilege and do not understand what it means to have nothing,are self-centered,disrespectful,and less likely to help other than previous generations.
3.0	Do you think the phone and social networking will let the education of the children becomes more difficult than it was in the past?
3.0	Do you often use the phone and social networking web site to gain some useful information?
3.0	In my opinion, these phone, online games and social networking Web site are not totally bad.
11.0	They may bring some benefit to the children's education and the study of the students is depend on themselves so if they are less-concentration, in the past they also will be disturbed.
5.0	Firstly, these phone, online games and social networking Web site could bring improve the education of these children.
8.0	In the past there are no website and phone so to gain the information these children want was very difficult; they just could ask their teachers and some question their teachers might cannot give answer very quickly.
8.0	But today these children can gain the information they want very quickly and accurately.
8.0	If they want to know the component of the air, they could check the screen of their phone or computer and input their question.
8.0	Then they will gain a lot of information about the component of the air like which investigation concludes the conclution or who conducts this investigation.
8.0	So they can obtain a lot of advantage from this phones and computers.
8.0	So this websits and phones let the education of the children becomes easier rather than difficult because they can get the knowledge very easily.
5.0	Secondly, the education of the children depend on children themselves and this did not determine to the outside things.
10.0	In the past there were not phones, online games and social networking Web site but children also could do other things which also will disturb their education.
7.0	So these phones and these w
11.0	With the rapid development of society,people would like to choose different ways to relax themselves.
11.0	There is a statement that Is is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.
11.0	From my perspective,i disagree it.
11.0	The physical exercise is the best way to refresh and relax yourself.
5.0	First at all,physical exercise has its special fuction in relaxing.
8.0	By playing basketball,fooball,volleyball,people.
8.0	especially for man,they will get more relax in consuming all of your energy and sweat perspiration.
8.0	After doing physical exercise,people wil be stronger and healthier,which is the best result of relaxing.
8.0	Oppositely,watching a movie or reading a book is a easier way to be relax,which is  simple.
8.0	Although you can also be relax in wacthing or reading,but i think it is temporary and it means that after a short time ,you will be less relaxed in the end.
8.0	Therefore,doing physical exercise can last for a longer time.
8.0	So it's a better way to relax.
5.0	Secondly,doing exercise can help yourself release your pressure buderened on you.
8.0	It  not only  can prevent you getting more nervous,but it also relieve the tession.
8.0	In my mind,these two ways can lead to different results.
8.0	Watching and reading leads you happier,which result from the exciting story.
8.0	On the contrary,doing physical exercise will make you feel relaxed from heart.
2.0	In a word,it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.
12.0	Currently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among student:  in today's words young people do not give enough time to help with the communities.
11.0	Opinion vary form person to person, some claim that the young people still give enough time to heping their communities.
11.0	However, from my perspective, i think it is ture that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.
5.0	Firstly, today's young people have more express, so they do not have enough energy to helping their communities.
8.0	To be more specific, because of the word become devoloped, young people need to learn more knowledge, like from school, internet or news.
8.0	So they are tired.
8.0	On the contrary, if we still let them must to helping their communities, they will loosen up the energy on other things, so it will effect their mental and body.
8.0	For example, when was in the high school, i did not need to learn much more knowledge, it was only just like school's education and some basic news on TV, so i have enough power and energy to helping mine communities, like to be a voleenter or teach young children for free.
8.0	But now when i went to the collage, my course become harder and diversity.
8.0	So i have to put more energy to study, and i do not have enough time to helping their communities.
5.0	Secondly, today's internets are more diversity, so it attract many yound student fell into it.
9.0	To be more specific, in the internet, their are many different type of games, so these games will trupt young people, and it will result in young people do not have enough time to helping their communities.
9.0	On the contrary, if they interest in their life, like to helping the communities and school activities, they will not do't have enough time and enough energy.
3.0	As the society developing, cooperation is always under debate.
3.0	Is team work really a excellent method for accomplishing assignments?
11.0	Although their are many people who love solitary and hold the view that doing tasks alone is more efficient, I am fully convinced that cooperation is the right choice.
12.0	So when there is an assign project from teacher, I regard working with others as a way that will bring more treasure to students, because of cooperation's can benefit a person's knowlegde and interpersonal relationship.
4.0	First, working with others can widen student's horizon by letting them be able to absorb other people's experience.
8.0	We all know that a man always think of things based on his own daliy experience and knowlege, suggesting that while working alone, people can hardly have break through.
8.0	Take a computer competation for example, there are rarely any individual perticipants.
8.0	For the reason that it's hard for one person to handle all the knowlege needed for finishing the tasks, such as coding, establishing a math model and writhing a paper.
8.0	Only by cooperation can this complex assignment be done on time.
4.0	Second, cooperation means communication with group members, with will definitely enhance the students' ability of getting along with other people and what's more, enlarge their social network.
8.0	Nowadays, students are usually the only child in home.
8.0	So they may think that being alone is the best way because of their lack of experience in communicate with others which will result in fear of geting along with other people.
8.0	This is apparently a bad cycle and should be breat down.
4.0	Finally, I have to agree that sometimes working alone is efficient for there won't be any disagreement and students wiil not need to have meetings to discuss with each other.
8.0	But if the cooperation is better used, it will obviously be the most eficient way.
8.0	It's easy to know that doing one thing a time is more time consuming that doing several things at the same time.
8.0	But for a single people, it's impposible to do muitiple things at a time.
8.0	Nevertheless, if dividing the whole task to several pieces and distributing them to numers of people, the task will be done quickly.
1.0	To sum up, cooperation can bring us a lot of profit in the aspects of not only study but interpersonal relationship as well.
1.0	And that's why I would like to choose to let the students work with others instead of doing tasks alone.
3.0	With the fast development and pace of the society, many people are more concern about the internet and transportation.
3.0	Some people suggests the government should pay more money on the internet, other thinks official should arrange more money on the transportation.
12.0	In my opinion, I think government should pay more money on the transportation, because transportation make the trip of citizens more convenient and can also improve the development of economics.
5.0	First, a convenient public transportation could save the time of citizens.
8.0	Human have several trip mode, rather than just going out by bus, thus people could choose the most effective way.
8.0	For example, 5 years old, I went school just by the bus or bike, even walked to the place.
8.0	But, after subway builded, we could chose went school by subway.
8.0	It was so fast and convenient, even 15 minutes I could arrived at the place.
8.0	However, in the past, I have to use 50 minutes went to the school, it brough a lot of convenient for my trip.
5.0	Secondly,  a good  public transportation could increase the speed of economics development.
8.0	More track could  run in a same road, that means it will attracts more investment to the city.
8.0	For instance, ShangHai was a shore city, countless goods arrived there to importing or exporting.
8.0	A good qualified road allow more tracks across the city, thus, more and more invester chose ShangHai as their starting point to exported their goods.
8.0	Thus, ShangHai was the first-rank financial city in the world.
0.0	Finally, although some people say that, improving the internet access could improve the education, because people could choose different courses from the internet to learn.
0.0	But, actually, not everyone choose study online.
0.0	Old man prefer choose gain the knowledges from the books and newspapaer, they are familiar with it.
7.0	the best
11.0	Today more and more people began to realize the importance of knowledge,and that is one of the reason why people today prefer reading or watching something to relax rather than physical exercising.
12.0	Basicly, I don't appreciate the idea that physical entertainments are less imprtant.
11.0	In my opinion both kinds of entertainments have their own benefits.
5.0	First of all, exercising is an ancient acivity of the human.
8.0	As you can see,sports such as football,soccer and basketball,they were all invented long ago.
8.0	Until now the games of NBA still win a high poplarity in the world.
8.0	This means people do enjoy those entertainments,and they earn their hobbies from those sports.
8.0	Secondly, except different kinds of sport games,we all need to practice some physical skills during our daily lives.
8.0	For example,learning how to swim could be particularly important sometimes.
8.0	When people do not have the spare time to practice those skillful things,all they need to do is to take them up as their hobbies,as they can learn useful skills and entertain at the same time.
8.0	The importance of physical entertainment is evident.
5.0	What's more,along with the growing history,the sport is clearing its own spirits.
8.0	These kinds of spirits were perfectly shown in all the Olympic games.
8.0	Friendship,love,peace of the world,such emotions were all involved in the spirit of Olympics.
8.0	It is human's brilliance which brought the simple sports to such a meaningful place.
8.0	So as time goes by,the sports would always be a combination of human's body health and their brilliant minds.
1.0	However,when I'm explaining the importance of relaxing by physical exercises,I don't mean I do not appreciate other entertainments at all.
1.0	Everyone knows how grateful the books are,and everyone must have experienced the joy of movies.
7.0	All in all,the
12.0	Nowadays, more and more peolpe do not want to travel abroud.
8.0	And I think domestic travel is a great way to have rest.
8.0	First, people travel in their own country can save monye and time.
8.0	In their own contry they have convenient traffic they can go to everywhere easily.
8.0	They don't need to worred about getting lost because of the language or other reasons.
8.0	For example I always travel with my family, we can drive our car to neighbor country in the morning to see the different kind of beautiful views and come back in the evening.
8.0	We don't need to spend whole days.
8.0	You know if you want to gou to foreign country you should prepare to do a lot of things like handle the passport, buy airplane ticket even the giant of medicine.
8.0	it is not only takes a lot of energ but also will spend a lot of your monye.
12.0	There is an old saying goes that if you have money, you can not do everything you want, but if you have no moeny, you can't do anything.
3.0	This teach us that money is really necessary for people, and many people could effort a lot for earning money.
10.0	So some people make an assumption that if campus promote the salaries of the university professor, their education quality could be improved.
11.0	And I totally agree with this perspective.
4.0	Firstly, this manner makes them be more willing to devote themselves in the education field.
8.0	Because they have more money to spend, they could urge themselves to do the best in his area, and they have more energy when they are work.
8.0	To illustrates, my father was a professor in a new school, and the salary is pretty low.
8.0	So everyday, he did not want to anything, because he thought that he did not gain what he effort, so he quitted quickly.
4.0	In addition, the manner could attract more excellent professor to come to the university.
8.0	Because of the high salary, there are increasing professors to come this campus, escpecially the professors who have wonderful kownledge could have more confidence to get this attractive job.
8.0	Take my father as an example, he established a university after he quitted the professor's job, so he knew what an excellent professor needs.
8.0	He invested a lot in the professor's salary, and then there were more and more superb professor came to his university to seek jobs, which promote the level of the selection of the professors.
4.0	Finally,  this manner enable the professor has positive attitude toward his campus.
2.0	They would feel more appreciate to the campus, because of the satisfied salary, which let them don't want to disappoint the leaders.
10.0	To.
12.0	Everyone can make mistakes, no exception for the leaders or teachers when they are speaking.
12.0	Confront the providing controversial situation, I believe that the best solution is to wait till after class or discussion .
4.0	Initially, interrupt a person and pointing out a teach's mistake in front of all students can be a really unpolite behavior to do, even creating a seriously embarrasing moment for teachers.
8.0	In our culture, trationally one shoule never interrupt another one's conversation, especially when the person is the ones we should repect .
8.0	Also, pointing out a teach's mistake in fornt of all his students will create extremely embarrasing situation for the teacher since they are making the type of low level mistakes simply detectable by other students.
8.0	When I was in sixth grade, I shouted out a mistake made by my Math instuctor while he was talking.
8.0	The action was embarrassed him so badly that  his face turned red and the whole class was laughing at him for minutes.
8.0	As  the result, it is unrepectful to point out our teachers' mistake while they were still talking.
4.0	Secondly, interrupt our teacher and point out their mistakes can potentially damage our relationship with them.
8.0	It is important to maintain a positive relationship with our teachers since they are the ones that determine whether to work hard for their students or not.
8.0	I remembered that after that thing happened which I already mentioned in the second paragraph, there are a lot more chances limited such as asking him for a letter of recommendation anf maybe a volunteer tutoring session.
8.0	Therefore, interrupt teachers' mistakes during the class can have a bad influence on the relationship.
4.0	Moreover, telling the teacher after the class can be easier to establish a positive image in the teacher' mind.
9.0	Not only the action the student did can show the student' hign emotional quality, but also can let the teacher know how the thoughtful and hard- working student is.
9.0	And the benefitial result can come out---- more study chances and knowledge the student can get.
2.0	To sum up, we should never interrupt a teach and correct he or she right away in front of all their students,instead, we should tell him or her after class, since we should be a polite person and have the mind can determine the true or false.
11.0	I don't think it's a good idea.
11.0	The most important reason is that when chilren get used to get the benefits after they succeed, they will lose interest in some conditions when they can't get awards.
6.0	I myself am an example.
8.0	When I was a kid, my family didn't have the ability to live well.
8.0	My parents were always busy with their company.
8.0	That got our life better.
8.0	Otherwise, that made their lack of education for me.
8.0	The best way for them to make me hard in studying is to offer money when I got a great mark in school.
8.0	As I grew up that I had to face a lot of problems in my life but not any of them I could get awards from my parents.
8.0	So that result in a lack of motivation.
8.0	I gradually became lazy and homekeeping.
8.0	When I had to face to the problem I always choosed opportunism.
2.0	That's why I think this idea is not right.
3.0	As the society developing in a fast speed, students most major question about their future is which career or the job they want to attend would led them a secure and successful future.
3.0	Due to their concern, they begin to compare what they are experiencing now to what their parents have experienced.
11.0	Some people think that in the pasr it's easier to identify which career or job would lead to secure and successful future, while others think that today is easier to identify.
11.0	From my point of view, I think it is easier to decide which job and career that lead a safe and successful job in today's society.
4.0	First of all, today's society has more oportunity, so no matter what kind of job or career one choose, their future is already guarenteed.
8.0	A lot of people may think that the society has become mature so the job opportunity is less, it's harder to find a job with good salary.
8.0	However due to the maturity of the society, more places are offered to the gruaduator and those who just enter the sociey.
8.0	People's future are guarenteed by their family, their country and even the society, to improve the society needs new blood to inject which leads lots of empty job that are not only challenging but also with high profit.
8.0	Take my brother as a good example, he has just graduated from college and he was really worried about getting a job.
8.0	My aunty has already get in touch with a friend who offered a place in his company to my brother.
8.0	Surprisingly, my brother found a job quite easily once he gratuated.
8.0	It's a newly strat-up company with nice pay and a comfortable working condition.
8.0	My brother now has his own car and the company he worked for is getting larger and larger.
8.0	So, that's why I think it is easier to identify which careera and job woul led to success future.
4.0	Second, We have more examples in today than those in the past.
8.0	"Parents in China always says that"" the salt I have eat is even more than the rice you have‘’, this means that the elders have more experience than us, they already experience the reult of the choice, so they could give us precious advice."
8.0	Also the example of my brother.
8.0	Before he enters univerisity, he plans to learn chemistry in school, however before he apply to chemistry major, he research on the internet and found that a lot of people who used major in chemistry don't encourage students to study chmistry only if they have strong passion in this subject.
8.0	Meanwhile the technology major is quite popular and a lor suggest that it's a good career to study, So my brother learn technology in university and this helps him find job easily.
4.0	Adimittedly, in the past less competition is in the society and people could guarenteed their future once they found a job in the governement.
8.0	However, the fact is, the competition is even harder at that time.
8.0	People needs to enters the society once they graduated because they need to help their parents to support the family.
8.0	In the pasr a lot of family has lots of children so the eldest child needs to help the parents to do lots of work.
8.0	So their future is even more unsucure because what they need is a fast way of making money, a fast way that helps them to support the whole family.
8.0	How can a life like this eaiser when deciding  which job or career would lead to secure future.
2.0	All in all, due to the society of our highly developed world, it is easier not only find a job but also guarteened one's future, that's why I believed that it is easier to identify which job or career would lead to secure job in todays' world.
3.0	What people should do to stay well-informed?
11.0	Some people believe that a person should retrieve information from various sources in order to be well-informed.
11.0	From my perspective, I strongly agree with this statement.
5.0	Firstly, a lot of information is inaccurate so that we need to look for different source to guaratee we get the correct.
8.0	Nowadays, the advancement of information technology enables us to find all sorts of information from Internet.
8.0	However, there are fraud information and message as well.
8.0	If we only look at one source, we can easily be deceived.
8.0	For example, in many rural areas, many people still believe that HIV can be infected by touching and hugging becasue they never look at other news sources.
8.0	People treat those patients as evil from hell and discriminate them badly.
8.0	But we all know that HIV will not affect people's daily communication.
8.0	So in order to get correct information, we cannot only fixate our mind and view at one objective.
5.0	Another rationale for checking different source is that it help us to look at things from different perspectives.
8.0	Modern society is highly globalised and values are much more uniform than ever before.
8.0	Yet many parts of the world still remain regmented and keep their unique standard; therefore, when we look at one thing, we need to learn others' view so that we can get a more comprehensive understanding about it.
8.0	For example, in most regions of the world, beef is one of the most welcomed food.
8.0	However, in India, cow is the scared animail and nobody eat beef at all.
2.0	All in All, I think that people need to check information from a variety of news sources becasue it can help us to find the geneiue message and understand things soundly.
3.0	Everyone care about how to success in their career in society.
3.0	but what is the essential factor of becoming successful?
11.0	some aruge that networking is more crisis than hardworking.
11.0	However, I hold the idea that hardingworking at school should be a more important factor of succes.
11.0	Without hardworking at school, one can hardly gain success in the future.
6.0	To begin with, people have to build up solid knowledge base for certain filed if they want to gain success in future career.
8.0	Working hard at school is the most effective way to quip oneself with background knowledge.
8.0	Although sometimes we may find there are some minors differences between theories and reality, these theories are still the most essential foundation assisting us to understand the practice.
8.0	Take myself as an example.
8.0	When I was an university student, my major is business administration.
8.0	I studeied how to communication with partner, how to make a well plan to other and how to make comments on subjects at school.
8.0	I worked very hard and in the thord years, and got a chance to big company for  a intership.
8.0	During this time, I totally put my knowledge into practice and handle real business in this company.
8.0	If I had not studied so hard, I could not deal with these business in this compant.
1.0	Moreover, comparing with getting well ralated with others, more skill can be  cultivated in the process of studying hard.
1.0	These skills may play indispensable role in a future job to obtain success.
7.0	For exampple, when I was in high school, in order to get higher score, I would
11.0	Every child needs to study in their school-age, because knowledge can lead them to be a successful person in the sociaty.
12.0	although children need to get some awards after they did something really pleasent.
12.0	Many parents may buy a gift for their children when they make a great progress in study, others just offer money to them, they may think this kind of measure can  encourage children to study harder.
11.0	But as for my opinion, I don't think it's a good way, because it may cause bad influence on their children.
8.0	If parents always offer money to children for each high grade, it may lead children study only for money, but not for themselves.
8.0	I think studying is a responsebility for students, get good grade can provide them a better future.
8.0	Parents offer money seems like can encourage students study hard for getting good grade, but it will let children assign the incorrect goal for their study.
8.0	Lots of parents offer their children money which surrond me, and their children even compair who get the most money after an exam, they all talk about the money they get, instead of summerizing the text.
6.0	Additionly, School-age children are lack of the ability to control themselves, when parents give their money after exam, they may use the money in bad ways like buy electric games and recreation magizines.
10.0	These are all not good for children's study, it will distract them from learning.
2.0	Although offering money to students can encourage them to study hard, and maybe after children get money they have more intrest in learning.
9.0	But I think if parents buy a gift for them can be a better choice.
9.0	Firstly, they can buy some useful things like books or schoolbags, it can avoid children to intackle money in incorrect way.
7.0	Secondly, it also can make good effect on stimulate children to study afte
3.0	In the class,the teachers always assign some projects to us as the home work,there are two types of this projects:First,we need to do a small project alone.
3.0	second,to do a bigger project in a group.
3.0	As far as i am concerned,i perfer to work on the first task alone,The reasons why i choose to do it alone can be expressed sa follows: First,if you want have a good commend of some knowledges or skills,you need to know all the aspects of it.
3.0	you go to the library ,read a lot of books and search effective information on the Internet.
11.0	When you solve the problem by yourself,you gained so much.
11.0	but only do a part could not bring you as much as same.
6.0	Second, It is obvious that you are more concerntrated on any details of homework than working with others.
8.0	Nobody or nothing can distract you from your work.
8.0	Second,the quality of projects depends on all of the group members,not one person.
8.0	For instance,you worked so hard to do the parts you should do,staying up to 2 am,definitely,this parts will be outstanding.
8.0	However,your parteners almost forget it,what should you do?
8.0	It is detrimental to your mood and confidence.
8.0	of course,if you work with some people who are so descplined,you are lucky.
2.0	From these summerises,we can draw the conclusion safely that if we want to gained more,we should do the projects alone as possible.
10.0	I agree that television advertising directed toward yound children should not be allowed, here are the reasons:
3.0	First of all,it is just waste of time and have no use.
3.0	These young children are too young to decide to buy onething or not,not only beacuse they have no money but also they are not old enough to tell their parents about buying itFor example,I never see any children ask their parents for anything because of the advertise.
12.0	So it is totally useless!
5.0	Next ,these children are not able to tell a thing is bad or good,they are not able to judge to do or not to do.
10.0	Some advertise is not suitful for children,some may teach them some bad things and they are just terrible for them!
5.0	What's more,sometimes these advertise may kill children's wonder of watching,it will have some influence on.
8.0	their mood and makes them unhappy.
8.0	Like my sister ,when she watches advertise, she will cry and be unhappy.
8.0	That is really too bad!
2.0	All in all,for children's happiness and making sure they can have a good life,  I think television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
3.0	Currently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate-whether people will spend less time cooking in twenty years.
3.0	Opinions vary from individual to individual.
3.0	Some people hold a negative attitude to this statement.
3.0	Nevertheless, I am firmly convinced that it is a tendency that people will cut down on the time spending on preparing food.
11.0	My view can be elaborated as follows.
5.0	First of all, people are more likely to eat outside in restaurants in the future.
8.0	To be more specific, with the rapid development of science and technology, our society is improving at an alarming speed.
8.0	As a result of wealth accumulation, people are more willing to enjoy a better life ao that they tend to go to advanced restaurants to taste delicious food from all over the world and appreciate the fantastic atmosphere there.
8.0	In contrast, at present people are less capable of affording the high prices in restaurants and they have no option but to spend much more time cooking at home.
8.0	A research conducted by Wuhan University is a good case in point, in which scientists investigated more that one thousand people across China about their frequency of going to the restaurants and the time spent on cooking over the last thirty years.
8.0	It turned out that the same participants thirty years ago tended to spend twenty five hours in kitchens every week, much more than the time today.
5.0	Besides, robots may substitude people and cook food for the family in the future.
8.0	To further illustrate my point, in modern society robots are a hot topic and countries in the world are attaching more and more importance to the development of robots.
8.0	The governments provide sufficient money for the scientific research institutions and students in college are also sparing no effort to promote the relevant techniques.
8.0	So despite the fact that robots are still not common at present, they are likely to step into each family and prepare food in the future.
8.0	For example, currently in America, scientists in MIT has invented a new robot which is competent to do laundries, cook food, clean the house and so on.
8.0	It is crystally clear that those robots are likely to become normal products and purchased by people.
10.0	I
3.0	Nowadays it's universally acknowledged that education becomes more and more impotant, so parents are likely to create some new method to encourge their students become more passionate about study.
3.0	Recently,the phenomenon that parents offer their children money for each high mark they get in school caused wide public concern.
12.0	Some people reckon that it will change children's opinion on study,but I content that giving some money to children as a reward is a good choice, whose merits outweight drawbacks.
4.0	It can't be denied that giving money to children as a reward can stimulate them to study harder.
8.0	When children get feedback of their hard work ,the study will be a joy rather than a boring thing.
8.0	They will do a lot of excerices and read more passages to improve themselves,so that they can make themselves outstanding in competitions.
8.0	Besides,getting a goal is necessary for children.
4.0	Another reason I want to express is that financial thinking is an virtal ability for mordern people,which means we need to teach children how to use their own money.
9.0	For instance,my parents used to give me mmoney as a reward in my childhood,and I used to deposit them.
9.0	I periodically save some money,which has become a large amount until now.
4.0	Of course,it's unwise to give children a large amount of money once a time,since that childeren will seek only for money when studying.
10.0	So we have to make sure that children will ont misunderstand the meaning of the money and keep a healthy attitude towards money.
1.0	So we can draw a conclusion very swiftly from what I have mentioned above.
1.0	I should reinforece my perspective that parents offer their school age children money for each high mark they get in school is a scientific and ecouraging method,which I really appreciate.
3.0	Nowadays, an interesting topic has aroused a heated debate: whether  people living in the past or current people are less happy or less satisfied with their lives?
11.0	Some people hold the view that it is the people living in the past because they have less ways to get entertainment.
12.0	However, as far as I am concerned, people now are less happy.
11.0	My view can be elaborated as follows.
6.0	First of all, the heavy pressure prevents prople from feeling happy and satisfied.
8.0	As we all know, current people suffer too much pressure caused by their heavy work.
8.0	Therefore, they are supposed to take advange of their talent to word hard and have some innovations in order to win the business competition.
8.0	At the same time, when other companies successufully occupy more shares in the market, all the people will be reluctantly receive some critics from their bosses.
8.0	All the things makes people fell nervous in their daily work and fail to feel happy.
8.0	For example, my uncle works in a company devising new smart phone.
8.0	Given that there are two many brilliant rivals doing the same thing, he is required to stay at his lab evryday in order to devise a more attractive new smart phone, which lets him feel unhappy and always has a bad quality in his sleep.
2.0	Furtheremore, the accelerating rate in terms of life forbids people from thinking about the happiness in their life.
8.0	It is for granted that people now are occupied in abanduant tasks.
8.0	So usually people feel stressful after spending too much time in working .
8.0	In this way, hardly will pople save enough time to reflect the details in their life, such as what makes them feel happy and what lets them get satisfaction.
8.0	Therefore, the only thing takes up their minds is stress and tire.
8.0	For instance, In order to acquire a good academic performance and perform well in our university's concert, I spend all my energy so that no sooner I arrive my dorm than I will sleep.
8.0	Therefore, never will I feel happy in my life.
12.0	In a modern society, people always face the dilemma to choose whether to get the news about the events happening around the word or should not know because it will unlikely affect your daily life.
12.0	This problem is the much debated one in that it affects everybody in their daily lives.
12.0	People may prefer one to another although some may have no opinions about it at all.
11.0	Before rendering my opinion, I think it is important to take a glance at the arguments of both ideas.
10.0	It is quite easy for me to choose the before one because the obvious reason that people will learn the world best.
4.0	If you get some information about enents happening around the world, you will get the best way to learn the world easily.
8.0	Take the example of my experiences , one day, I watched the TV news like usual.
8.0	At the meantime, the weather forecast told the listeners the typhoon was coming, they suggested people should not go outside.
8.0	I get the infoamation and told around my neighborhood, so when the typhoon acrossed the cicy, people thanked me to save their life.
4.0	Get the knowledge about events happening around the world will help you learn the better.
10.0	Acroding to the newspaper, there was a little survey,the results reckons that there about 80 percents people choose the know about events happening around the world, by this way, they can get more information to border their herozion.
4.0	In other words, know about events happening around the word by ask strager people is a new social way.
10.0	You can ask some stragers about themslves's life, according to this process, I guess you can make good new friends.
2.0	After all, I think we all should to know about events happening around the world,even if it is unlikely that they will affect your daily life, It can help you to live the better.
12.0	I think it is totally a bad idea for parents to offer money for their children's high grade.
12.0	First of all,as far as I am concerned,though it will help kids get high marks in test,it  leads kids to form  the wrong concept of the money and hardworking.
11.0	What's more, they may regard money as their only belief easily.
5.0	Secondly, if there is only the money,once it disappares,children will lose their interest in study,which is more harmful to themselves.
8.0	Thirdly,it is wrong to measure grade with money.
8.0	Knowledge is invalueable.
8.0	Kids need to learn to konw about the world around them by using the knowledge,which is the actual benefit of study.
5.0	Take my cousin as an example,he is poor at the study.
8.0	In order to arise his interest in study,my aunt used the same way as the article mentions.
8.0	At first,it did works.
8.0	However,the greed of my cousin was too big,which can't be meeted by my aunt.
8.0	Therefore,his study grade becames low again.
8.0	And he even complained that his failure in study was due to my aunt.
2.0	We have to reflect this according to this thing.
7.0	In genery,I disagree with it
3.0	As mentionend above, there exists one phenomenon that some parents offer their children money each time they get high grades in school.
11.0	Towards this controversial behavior, people's opinions differ.
5.0	In my opinion, I'm highly agreeable of the behavior.
8.0	I owe my view to reasons mentioned as follows.
8.0	First and foremost, it goes without saying that such behavior functions as a propeller to motivate some kids to keep striving in study for there is some real prides for them to chase.
8.0	Also, after a lot of work being done, more or less, the kids will be tired and weak.
8.0	Some money that will be given to them not only function as a form of recognition of children's effort but also serve as a encouragement and compliment to kids.
8.0	What's more,what these parents do may make their children maturer.
8.0	As we know, in this highly competitive and cruel world, it's not east for children to survive in the society as they grow up.
8.0	They may face a seris of problems which are difficult and intricate to cope with.
8.0	By earning possessions in this way, these children may realize the difficulty to gain money and such behavior will have a benefit on them to be more patient and deligent.
5.0	As far as I'm concerned, some measures ought to be taken in two aspects to deal with the situation.
9.0	On one hand, parents should  be more patient and give some appropiate education to their children, along with the reword.
9.0	On the other hand, children is obliged to care about their parents more and try to understand thier parents.
2.0	All in all, only with constant and joint efforts from both the parents and kids can we make the circumstance better.
3.0	with the development of education, more and more children go to school.
12.0	When children get high grade, some parents will give them money for encouraging.
11.0	Some people think that it is a good idea for arising study of children.
11.0	As for me, I disagree this opinion.
5.0	Studying is the duty of school-age children, so parents need not offer money for getting high mark by children.
8.0	I think that paying money is a economy behavior which someone do some out duty things for gain money.
8.0	But students should study hard, and think how to get higher mark because students must try their best for future.
8.0	If parents offer their children money to encouraging them, the children may think getting high grade or studying well is in order to get money.
8.0	When parents no longer offer them money, they may give up studying well.
8.0	Therefore, studying well as a duty is not encouraged by money.
5.0	Offer children much money may make them spend these money on some unsufficant things even bad things because children usually do not know how to use money to do some good things.
8.0	If children control too much money, they may buy some wasts food, or too many toys.
8.0	Although buying some books is benifit for them to study better, they will buy many things to effect their study.
8.0	It may make them learn wasts.
8.0	So I think that children own much money is not a good thing.
7.0	Studying is children's duty and they also do not have ability of contorl themselves, therefore parents should not dffer their chilren
3.0	At present, a contraversial topic has aroused a heated debate: whether young people today are more prone to invest their time and efforts in perfecting the world than young people in the past.
3.0	Answers vary from one to another.
3.0	Some people claim that young people don't pay attention to the development of the world nowadays.
11.0	However，contrary to their view comes my own perspective that young people in the modern society indeed pay much more attention to the world around them and are more willing to improve the world.
11.0	My viewpoint is based on the following reasons.
5.0	First, the swift development of society provides young people much more convinience to change the world.
8.0	To be more specific, with the advent of AI era and Internet generation, nowadays people usually handle their tasks on Internet.
8.0	Only through manipulation on the computers can people finish a series of transactions or other businiess in a short time.
8.0	As we all know, young people are skillful in using the high-tech so they could easily finish the tasks assigned for them, which may be one part of improvement of the world.
8.0	For example, my brother Jack started a Internet company whose field is social media.
8.0	My brother is only 24 years old and his team members are also very young.
8.0	Seen as a group of young children without social experience by the public, mu brother's team fully exploited the convinience the Internet provided for them and spend so much time and efforts in creating an socialization app.
8.0	When the app came out , it made a hit.
8.0	This app has more than thousands of active users.
8.0	If my brother lived twenty years ago, their team could not have made such a great success.
5.0	Second, modern education also increase young people's awareness of devotion to development of the world.
8.0	Specifically, with the improvement of the foudamental education, more and more young people realize that they shoulder the responsibility to make the country and even the world prosperous since they are the young generation of the world and they are equipped with the required professional knowledge and capacity.
8.0	For example, my father was born in a time with poor condition and was not well-educated.
8.0	As what he had told me before, what he only wanted to do in the young age was just to support his family and find a suitable spouse.
8.0	That's quite different from what young people think nowadays.
8.0	What we put in mind is that we need to totally use the knowledge we have learned to repay the society.
2.0	In conclusion, young people are indeed more likely to spent their time and endeavors in improving the world.
3.0	In recent years, with the advancement of technology and improvement of household income, more and more citizens have easy access to personal computers at home, which means that children are more likely to be exposed to computers when they are young.
3.0	Therefore, various computer games are available for youngsters nowadays.
3.0	Some people hold the view that playing computer games is totally a waste of time and little kids should be prohibited to play.
11.0	From my own perspective, I can't agree with  that idea since I believe that playing computer games is beneficial to children to some extent and the following reasons will support my points.
4.0	First of all, playing computer games provides children a good opportunity to a acquaint with others and obtain social skills such as communication and teamwork.
9.0	Children who are limited in the classroom and have less chance to meet more people in their lives, as a result, playing computer games offers them another way to know people who have the interests.
9.0	In addition, cooperation and effective communication are needed while playing computer games, so on the other hand, computer games encourage children to talk with other players efficiently, besides, they will have the notion that teamwork is an essential part to gain success in the future.
4.0	Furthermore, computer games not only improve intelligence but also release children from study pressure.
8.0	A lot of games require children to have extensive knowledge and deep thoughts to finish tasks.
8.0	It means that they have to think all the time.
8.0	Moreover, under the increasingly heavy burden of academic study, children intend to play computer games for relaxation.
8.0	Thus, their mind will be refreshed, their concerns will be forgotten and then they can restart their study better.
4.0	However, we have to admit that some children are addicted to computer games and they are too immature to refuse temptation.
8.0	It is the real reson why people think that playing computer games is time-consuming for children.
8.0	But parents can give their children correct guidance and supervision to solve the problems.
8.0	For example, they can regulate the time spent on games and prevent children from violent games.
2.0	All in all, I can draw a conclusion that computer games will benefit children instead of ruining them only if we lead them to the right way and it is an excellent thing to enrich their lives.
3.0	"With the development of Internet, the whole world is developing into an so-called ""earth village"", making information sharing become available."
3.0	Some events happening at the end of the world will be known immediately.
11.0	Some people believe that it is essential to know about events that happen around the world, while others think that this is uncessaray because these events are so far away from us and will not affect our lives.
11.0	As far as I am concerned, I strongly believe that we need to know about events happening around the world.
4.0	Firstly, knowing about more events around the world will be good for us to develop critical thinking ability.
8.0	Sometimes some events will be fiercely dicussed by people.
8.0	In the process of learning about these events, you can see many opinions and comments from different people.
8.0	Then you need to tell which is right and which is wrong.
8.0	You even cannot help discussing with your friends.
8.0	In order to support your own idea, you have to collect a lot of information in the library or on the internet.
8.0	All these wil do good for your critical thinking ability.
4.0	Secondly, being aware that many terrible things are happening in the world will make you treasure your life better.
8.0	As for me, everyday when I read the news, I can see that many people are suffering from hunger, thirsty, violence, even war.
8.0	All these things are so far away from my life that I can never imagine the scene without the news.
8.0	Everytime I see these events, I will feel that I am so lucky to live in my country and so happy to grow up in my own family.
4.0	Thirdly, knowing more events in the world will make you be more intelligent when making decisions about your own life.
9.0	We are often confronted with many choices and sometimes we don't knoe what to do.
9.0	If we are able to know some familier things previously, we will be more confident and intelligent when we are making a decision.
1.0	To sum up, I think events happening around the world are all connected with us.
1.0	Knowing more about them will help us be more intelligent, have critical thinking ability and make us feel happier.
3.0	Recently there is a heated disscussion about whether the chikdren in modern time spend more time on doning their homework  or taking part in organized activities relate.
3.0	Some people believe that these day, children can not spend their mostly time on homework or activites relate because they have more entertainment.
3.0	Howevevr,  the others hold a dissimilar viewpoint that withe the develpopment of society, children have had to pay more attention on homeworking an activity relate.
11.0	As for me, i agree with the later one.
10.0	Myreason and examples are listed as follows.
5.0	one reason why i am in favor of my perspective is that the student must to spend more time on study to get a better future.
8.0	this is because the pressure of competition in society is increasing, which result in the fact that student must to get more knoweledge to get a good score, so they win get a good diploma and can get a suitable job. a good exampleof this is my borther.
8.0	when he was young, he thought getting a simple job is easy so he never spent more time on study.
8.0	But when he graduated,he found he could not get any job because a mere job as a waiter also need a high degree.
8.0	As the example suggests, the children living in modren time must spend more time on study.
5.0	Another reason used to support my opintion is particpating in organized activities relate can enhance children's leadership.
10.0	this is due to the fact that if children organize a activites, they must to be a responsible leader to keep this activity, which can increase their leadership.
7.0	A good explam of this is my sister , she used to organized the ac
12.0	Nowadys,parents in China tend to keep their chirdren away from mistakes since they don't want their kids to taste failure.
12.0	But,in this way,those chirden could lose the chance to learn from their own mistakes.
6.0	In my opinion,parents should let chidren make mistakes.
8.0	Firstly,parents coudn't look after their chirdren all the time,therefore children will leave their parents and live their own life.
8.0	If chirdren have learnt from their mistakes in their young age,they can avoid making those mistakes again.
8.0	Secondly,there is a saying goes that what you have suffered in you chirdhood time will be you life foutune.
8.0	Definitely,mistakes isn't a kind of wonderful things that people prefer to have,which usually leads to bad result.
8.0	But,once you have made a mistake you are less  likely to do it agin.
8.0	Thirdly,it is not neccessary to avoid the mistakes.
8.0	Human as we are ,we can't be perfect.
8.0	If parents pretend that their chirdren to be good all the ways,chirdren will get too innocent to this world,which is not beneficial to their growth.
8.0	\ To draw the conclusion of my view,an example can be depicted as fellow.
8.0	When I was young,my mom always followed me.
8.0	She helped me with my homework and teached a lot of things of avoiding mistakes,At the beginning,I felt good because I could do better in my homework then my classmates.
8.0	As time travels,I become more depand on her.
8.0	But she coudn't help me all the ways.
8.0	So I started to make a lot of mistakes,thus being looked upon by others.
8.0	Since that time,I became me independent and tried to everything by  myselfs.
8.0	It turned out that we could learn more things from our own mistakes.
1.0	In a word,chirdren should be more independent while they are doing things.
1.0	They might make a lot of mistakes,but they do learn a lot from it.
3.0	When you was a school-age child, the most happy thing for you when teating is what?
12.0	For most of the chilren, they always get some money when they get high grade,then chilren will use the money to buy some thing they want.
12.0	It is not uncommon since most of the parents wants their chilren perform well in te school.
12.0	And from my perspective, it's a good idea for parents offer their chilren money when they get high grade.
6.0	To begin with, Offering money to those kids who get a high grade will cutivate childrens interesing toward study.
8.0	In fact, mos t of the students need targets when they are study.
8.0	And giveing children money goes a long way to stimulate children to study.
8.0	For instance, when l was a child, my mother said that she will give me 100 yuan if l get A in math test.
8.0	For me, 100 yuan means my favourate toycar can bought by me.
8.0	As a reslut, l study hard in math class and put most of time in study instead of playing computer game.
8.0	Finaily, l get A in test, and get the money to buy me dreaming toy car.
8.0	In brief, offer chldren with money will make them study hard.
2.0	On the top of that, giving money to kids when they get high mark will make children realize that they can achieve their target buy themseleves.
7.0	It means if they have some dreaming stuff, they can strave for
3.0	Nowadays, the teaching ways of parents are way different from the past since the condition of the education is totally different.
12.0	some poeple think that children now don't have the ability to make their own decisions because their pearnts just choose all the selection for them.
11.0	I don't agree with this idea for several reasons.
4.0	Admittedly, young people nowadays are more talent and smarter than the one in the past which means they are more capable to solve problems becasue they have a better condition of educate.
8.0	Besides, they don't need to make a lot decision becasue their parents will fix those out and they just need to do whatever their parents say since their parents will not harm them.
8.0	Since making decisions can spend you plenty of time, if you save that time, you can do more things like finishing your homework or taking a rest.
8.0	Also, young people are too young to make some important decisions like which university they go or what job they take.
8.0	These significant selection are necessarily discussed with you parents because young people usually don't have enough experience about the job or the society.
8.0	Therefore, let your parents to make that decision seems to be the best choice.
4.0	In addition, since the young people usually don't take options by themselves, their ability of choosing and making decisions will reduced which means the young people now are not as capable as the young poeple in the past at the aspect of making the decisions.
8.0	For example, a student is about the age of getting to the university and his parents have already chosen his school, his major and his career.
8.0	From the thought of the parents, they think that they have made the best choice for their child.
8.0	In fact, the fact is nearly opposite because if a person doesn't make any decisions, he will lose this ability of judging the value of each selection.
8.0	His parents can make the choice for him temporarily but eventually he will leave them and live alone.
8.0	However, at that moment, his ability of making decisions has just exploited  by his parents for replacing him to make choise.
8.0	So obviously the young poeple in the past are better able to make decisions about their own lives.
4.0	Finally, in the past, the parents often didn't have enough time for taking care of their children.
9.0	Thus, they would not take the place of their children to make decisions which means people in the past had more opportunties to make choice about their own lives by themselves.
9.0	In doing so, they can better able to choose the best decision for themselves.
2.0	In conclusion, I believe that the young people in the past were better at making decisions about their lives.
12.0	agree Nowadays, parks and exercise equipment are built around our living area, it is common that lots of people go to do sports in the parks to improve their health.
11.0	some of the elder people argue that physical exercise is much more important for the people on their age, and some of them oppose this.
11.0	In my opinion, doing exercise is important for elder people, and there are several reasons to support.
5.0	First of all, doing exercise can help older people to improve their health.
8.0	Unlike young people, older people usually do not have a strong body.
8.0	They are easier to get sick and hard to heal.
8.0	Doing exercise can help them to keep energetic and have a healthy body.
8.0	Also, they can live long and enjoy the beauty of the world.
5.0	second, physical exercise is not important to the young people because they have lots of other things that are much more important to them.
8.0	Compare to the older people, young people have a heavy workload.
8.0	They also have a family that needs to take care of.
8.0	During this situation, the job is much more important than everything.
8.0	Because the job is the financial support of this family, once it loses the family will break.
8.0	All of this is more important to young people than older people.
8.0	That why I agree with this statement.
7.0	From what has been discussed above, we can easily reach the conclusion that physical exercise is much more imp
12.0	Nowdays, people are facing freat pressor coming from study, work or family, which leads to relax more improtant for everbody.
12.0	Many may choose to relax by seeing a film or reading a book, and others prefer to do some physical exercise to relieve ther stress.
12.0	As for me, I like the latter better, adn I totally disagree with tha statement that it is better to relax by wathing a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.
4.0	To begin with, people who have been under great pressure have to take a break to relax their eyes and mind.
9.0	If they choose to watch a movie or read a book, it does harm to thier eyes problem or even headache.
9.0	As a result, it is better to do some physical exercise to feel the nature, making your eyes relaxed and clearing your mind.
4.0	Secondly, physical exercise can not only provide you a chance to be exposes to the outside world, but it also keep you in mentally and physically health.
8.0	On the contrary, watching a movie or reading a book can only assist you in maintaining mentally healthy.
8.0	For example, when I feel stressed out, I am fovor in physical exercise.
8.0	Because I will enlighten myself during the process as well as keeping fit, especially keeping in good figure.
8.0	But I can not benifit from barely wathing one or two movie or just reading some inspiring books.
4.0	Last but not least, it is common for people to watch moive alone and to enjoy reading at home, which prevent them to get chance to go outdoors.
10.0	Being addicted to work, study, family or so on has suspend people to go out, if they do not rely on relaxation time to go out the room to breathe the fresh air and to cope with various peoplr from all different cultreres, which is a pity for them at least in my opinion.
1.0	All in all, taking physical exercise has far more advantages over only watching a movie or reading a book.
1.0	Through the exercise, you can relax your eyes, keep mentally and physically healthy and go outddors to communicate with others.
12.0	Most of people want to born less children as the living standard is better, and the population size is larger and larger.
12.0	In a family, it is a commen situation that two parents only fouse on one child, so that they become afraid that their child making mistake because they worry the children hurt them selves.
11.0	However, in my opinion, it is necessary and benificial for children to make mistakes and learn from their own mistakes.
5.0	First of all, making mistakes and learing from it can help children to have more exprence.
8.0	when children make mistakes, they will know what is wrong, and then they can study for how to crect it.
8.0	At next, they will not make same mistakes again.
8.0	Making myself as an example, when I answered some math questions wrong, I will collect them on my book, and when the teacher test it next time, I can hand out a good answer.
8.0	All of the mistakes in the test are becoming my personal exprence to help me getting a good grade.
8.0	What is more, this exprence is significant and can never be instead because when children try to corect the mistakes, they need to solve a sum of problems.
5.0	Secondly, when parents let children  make mistakes and learn from their own mistakes, children will be more brave to face challenge in the future.
7.0	As a child, touching this world every time means that he wants to
3.0	First,I agree to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.
3.0	For me, I am a girl.
3.0	I always watch movies when I am tired.
3.0	Cause when I watch something I don't need to think.
3.0	I feel relaxed when I watch some beautiful places ,handsome men, pretty girls and a serie designed clothes that I can't waer in my  daily life.
11.0	Something I can't get in my life,but I can see it at movies.
10.0	How comfort it is.
6.0	I like reding books,  from my childhood.
8.0	I reads cartoon books when I was a baby girl.
8.0	I heard I even can recite Chinese poems when I was 3 years old .
8.0	It's cool,isn't it?
8.0	When I read books I always image the situation from the words and some details from the sentences.
8.0	I image if I am the main character ,what will happen.
8.0	When I read a book before I sleep and I will dream it .
8.0	It is amazing , right?
8.0	Sometimes, I feel life was so hard when I face some difficulties.
8.0	I will read books.
8.0	It takes me to another world.
8.0	Give me time to get better.
8.0	It brought me to the place of abundance.
8.0	Encorage books also give me energe.
8.0	That is why I think book is a nice way to relax.
2.0	By the  way, doing physical exercise is also good for our body.
7.0	But I don't  like ex
11.0	It is acknowledged universary that doing exercise every week is benefical to our healthy, however, there has a statement says when people want to relax themselve, reading a funny book or watching a well-known movie are better choices that doing physical exercise, which is hard to me to agree.
5.0	As we all know, doing exercise can help us enstrong our body, people cannot achieve too much unless he has a strong body, as myself, for example, during the final exam I just took last mouth, I work too hard to review my course, and I didn't do any exercise in a mouth.
9.0	However, when the final exam finally came, I got a badly code, which made me feel so sick during the whole exam, and the grades were not good as my thought.
9.0	After the exam, I noticed that it is very improtant for us doing exercise every week, and it is good for our healthy.
5.0	Watching movies or reading books is also a good way to relax ourselve, reading a good book can broaden our horizons, watching a movie can make us have a wonderfor time.
9.0	what i am want to say is, we cannot forget the improtance in doing exercise, doing exercise can not only relax our body but also help us have a strong body.
9.0	Wht's more, doing exercise with friends also give us some time with our friends, as we all know, with the development of our society, it is hard to have some time with our friends, and doing some things we like, doing exercise is a good way to do it.
3.0	Nowadays, there are a growing numbers of univerisities are established.
12.0	When choosing which unniversity to enter, students have to consider many aspects of it.
11.0	With regard of what stand for the greatness of a university, many people might think that universities owning famous professors is essential.
12.0	As far as I am concerded, i believes that universitier whose graduates can hunt good jobs in the future is more attarctive.
4.0	Frist and foremost, the most common reasons for high school students to enter a unniversites is to seek a well-paid job after graduation.
8.0	Owning to the fact that a job that provide high salary is contributed to improve physical and mental well-being, many unniversity students set it as a goal.
8.0	A great job always ensure people a brillant future.
8.0	There is no better illustration of the point better than the example of my cousin, Jack.
8.0	When he just finished his university entrance exams, he have to choose a dream school for the next four years.
8.0	For his future achievement, he choosed a great university that most  of its gradutates ended up as a famous banker.
8.0	By attending this kind of univerisities, he is very likely to have a decent job in the future.
8.0	Had he not entered a school like this, he might have to spend plenty of time to make his dream come true.
4.0	In addition, these universities that are able to ensure graduates a good jobs means they have better educators.
8.0	As we can see, if graduates can get a decent job, he or she must be equiped with some basic skills and knowledge, which means he or she have a great teacher.
8.0	For instance, my brother , Allen, now is a successful lawyer.
8.0	When I ask him about how he gain his job, he always mentions about a professer he met in his university.
8.0	He said that his professer have a gift to simplify those hard concepts and help his students to understand them.
8.0	To this end, most of his students can grasp these knowledge and get decent jobs after graduation.
8.0	As the example indicates, universities like these always have better professers.
4.0	There is no denying that universities where there are famous professors are not good.
9.0	Famous professors means this school have a advantage in research.
9.0	But these professors are famous because of their researches, not teaching skills.
0.0	So, if someone want to learn some specificed knowledge in some field and be a researcher, these school might be a good choices.
0.0	But for most of students, they are not concerned about this, hunting a high- wage job is their goal.
0.0	So, for these above reansons, there are so much advantages we can get from a universities whose graduates can find good jobs.
3.0	As is illustrated in the passage,there are more and more parents giving their children for getting high marks.
12.0	I totally disagree with such behaviour.
11.0	It does more harm than good to children.
11.0	The reasons are as follows.
5.0	From where I stand,giving money to children as awards is such a bad thing.
8.0	First,children are too young to make a good use of their money.
8.0	It is easy for them to spend their money on useless things,like toys,candles,snacks and so on.
8.0	Not only will they form a bad habit of buying useless things.
8.0	But also they will become easily annoyed when they can't afford to buy things they want.
8.0	If they are easy to be saitisfied by materials,they will tend to be unwilling to communicate with their families or friends.
5.0	What's more,high grades can not be identified as money.
8.0	As students,trying to study well and gaining more knowledge is our duty.
8.0	We learn not for our parents,but for ourselves.
8.0	We should be responsible for our own future.
8.0	At the same time,as parents,we can't attach much importance to children's grades.
8.0	It is one's ability,social skills,physical and mental health that really count.
0.0	Last but not least,we should teach children the difficult of gaining money,instead giving their money easily.
0.0	As the old saying goes,'No pains,no gains.'
0.0	Money is not easy to gain.
0.0	To make a sum up,it is not apporiprate for parents to give their children money for each high grade.
0.0	We should correct the wrong behaviour.
11.0	In my opinion,I do not reaaly agree with the behavior that these parents do.
11.0	We have to define the basic conceptions of money.
12.0	The money is the thing for a person to gain other things for exchange and a kind of disire that people may do sonthing rediculous for.
12.0	So here are three different ideas to suppot m own status.
4.0	Firstly,I have said that money is a kind of a desire for a person whatever it is for an adult for a kid.
10.0	In this case, the childrenmay regard the money as the feedback for their hih mark ,and this will certainly cause many bad impact for the children's idology because it is not good for a child to have such a kind of disire when he or she is young.
4.0	"Secondly, the money is not for such a kind of ""providing""for the children 's high mark."
10.0	When the children are having the test ,they will think that money is the only purpose for a test ,and this conseption is obviously wrong,so it is not hard to see that the children should have the right idea of  money and they shouldn't have the misunderstanding of money because of the tests.
4.0	Finally,which is the most important,the children should have the right under standing of their tests.
8.0	The test for the children is to check the efficiency and how well or bad they study for the long or short period before.
8.0	So in this case, is it properly for parents to use money to measure their efficiency?
8.0	Of course not.
8.0	It will just let them to gain the marks for money but not to check themslves,and they would misundertad the conception of a test.
1.0	In conclusion,the children should have a right idology of the test that they atre having and don't let the money to have the unproperly influence on them.
1.0	What's more ,the money should be given in the proper time from parents to children because the way of giving money is also a way to show parent's own meature attitude somehow.
3.0	"I don't think it's a good idea that ""some parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade thay get in school."
3.0	Nowadays,many children study just for the prize that from their parents,even most of children don't want to study at all.
3.0	Giving the money to children for their high grades make the children utilitarian and lack of the independent.
5.0	Firstly,giving money for good grades will make the children think that studying just for money and it is not their own thing.
8.0	I had a friend when I studied in meddle school.
8.0	this friend's parents would gave the money to him when he got good grades.
8.0	During this time, his grades are very high and he studied most of time.
8.0	But one day,his parents didn't give money to him,and he argued with his families and his grades started to be lower,he never be the interested in study.
8.0	Studying is a neccessary thing for children, whatever they can get the money or not.
5.0	Secondly,giving money will make the children think it is easy to get the money and waste money.
8.0	My friend Mike is a good student, he always get high grades,and his families give him money as the prize.
8.0	In this way, he often spend money on many things,and he don't know how to save the money.
8.0	For instant,he often buy some stuff and never wonder the prize.
8.0	"When someone told him that he should save money,he usually say""I will get money from my parents,becuase I have gotten high grade."""
10.0	Although children get the money by themselves, it not good for them.
1.0	Summerize, I disagree with that parents offer their children money for each high grade they get in school.
1.0	Becuase it not good for the ghildren's thinking and mental.
3.0	After the industrializaton, the workers bacome an undispensiable part of the world.
12.0	How to let the workers to work in an more effective way and how to make the worker happier during their work time are widely concerned by a lot of people.
12.0	I think it is obviously that the workers are more satisfied when they have many diierent types of task to do during the workday than they only do similar tasks all day along.
12.0	Here are some reasons to support my view.
5.0	First, different types of tasks can prevent the worker from feeling boring of the similar work.
8.0	Everyone in the world likes to learn something new, to explore the things we don't know.
8.0	When workers are faced with multi-works.
8.0	The can know something new or get some different feelings which they haven't experienced before.
8.0	That will make them feel interesting and be more satisfied with their work.
8.0	On the contrast, if the do the same thing everyday, that a really bad and monotonus sense for them.
8.0	Even listening to a beautiful music for all day will let us don't want to hear it any more, not to mention the baring work the workers are facing.
5.0	On top of that, diiferent types of of task make the workers think they can achieve a great deal of things.
8.0	No one wants to do the same thing all day for that's seem that he can only do this thing.
8.0	If ther get many types of task, they may think they are versatile and it brings them a kind of achievement.
8.0	This will absoutly make them feel satisfied.
8.0	Supposing that you are now work in a IT cpmpany, and your leader give you a lot of things to do.
8.0	You may design different programms and prove you can make it.
8.0	That will make you feel much better than just recite the same work you type in da after day, which make you feel you are useless.
8.0	This example strongly demonstrate that they will be more satisfied if they are allowed to do different kinds of work
1.0	In a nutshell, giving workers different types of work can make them feel more interesting as well as a kind of fufillment.
1.0	So  they are more satisfied with their work under such a condition.
3.0	For most of the families, both fater and mother are workers, which means that they have to be busy doing their work leaving little time to spend with their children.
3.0	However, the time spending with parents are quite important of the growth of a child.
12.0	When parents have limitted time for their children, some contens that it is best to use that time doing things together that are related to schoolwork, which from my opinion, is stupid and not  necessary.
5.0	To begin with, children nowadays have suffer too much pressure from their study and hardly have time resting themsevles.
8.0	To be more specific, many children are supposed to have eight or more classes in the school including math, native langue, science and forigen language.
8.0	What's more, on weekends, some of children even are forced by their parents to have extal lessons like dancing, singing and painting.
8.0	As a result, they are eager to have relaxing time, especially the time spending with their parents.
8.0	If the parents are willing to accompany their children to play games or sports, children will enjor the life more, and probably they may love the world, considering the world are not full of pressure but also the good time with their parents.
8.0	However, if the parents spend time just to do homework with children, things get worse because the children will suffer more pressure and can;t feel any beauty of life at all.
5.0	Besides, spending time with children for entertainments also make a perfect childhood for children.
8.0	The innet characteristic of children is playing, and if parents can help them to have a happier childhood, they will appricaite parents when they grow up.
8.0	Take meself as an example.
8.0	When I was a student in a primary school, I lived with my grandparents and was allowd to live with my parents only on weekends, because my parents were too busy to take care of me.
8.0	To compensate and to make me happy, my father always played computer games with me.
8.0	Ever time I met him on weekends, we talked about the figures and backgroud of the games all the time, and I really had a happy childhood eventhough I could not with my parents all my childhood.
8.0	Now, I appreciate that they has given me a wonderful childhood .
2.0	To make a conclution, if parents have extral time from their busy work, I stongly suggest spending time with children in some entertainments and happy activities, because not only to realse the pressure of children but also to build a worth-memory childhood for them.
12.0	With the developmet of society, people are facing increasly pressure in work and study, so entertainments become to play a more important role in our daily life.
12.0	Most of us choose movie and book to relax, while others are in favour of physical exercise.
11.0	Althought different poeple have different opinions on one thing, for me, I still hold the view that doing physical exersice foe relaxing is better.
5.0	Physical exercise create balance for our body.
8.0	Not only we working but also learning, we are using our brain in doing headwork.
8.0	On the contrary, we are moving our body when we are doing physical exercise.
8.0	In headwork, we use our brain too much that we might completely forget our body.
8.0	As we working for a long period of time in this situation, we may one day feel that we are not as strong as we were.
8.0	So if we can do physical exercise to relax, it will be more possible for us to avoid form getting this.
5.0	Physical exercise make work efficiency.
8.0	In good health circumstance, we can focus more on working.
8.0	Take myself for instance, when I was sitting in front of computer and books all day, I got sike of it.
8.0	While if I can stand and do some physical exersice, I can easily get into study again and have more fun.
8.0	So it is the combination of headwork and physical exercise that will get the most efficiency if work.
1.0	Physical exercise help build relationship with others.
1.0	In watching
11.0	Nowadays，some parents give their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school,I do not think it is so good.
5.0	First of all,the parents gives the money to children,let the children think that as long as the school will be rich, in fact,this is a very wrong approach .
10.0	Because the child is still small,he did not distinguish between right and wrong ability ,in the future he may only grow money and forget those who really pay the people.
5.0	In addition,why give children pocket money ?
8.0	I believe that your child can not get everything he wants.
8.0	They have to learn to allocate money to the place,and save money to buy their favorite things.
8.0	Children regularly get some pocket money,so that they can learrn the budget,understand the use of money or the lack of money reality .
8.0	I think it is not a good idea forparents to do things to buy their children and say ''he does not need pocket money''.
8.0	If the parents are rich ,give the child a lot of money,or parents are poor,nothing to the children,are not appropriate.
8.0	The ideal approach is that the child should receive a subsidy.
8.0	In this way,they can decide when and where to buy what to buy what they want to buy,anyway,this is waht they must learn to grow up.
2.0	When do you start to spend money on your child?
9.0	Two or three years old children have the ability to shop to spend money to buy what they want,and between A and B to make a choice.
9.0	For smaller chidren,you can give him some coins and save the box,so that she has a minimum''savings'' concept.
7.0	Let 's imagine you give five-year-old children a five
3.0	It's always a detable topic about how could young people behave well in modern society.
11.0	Some people hold the opinion, which I can't totally agree with, that young people just need to follow the construction from those elderly ones and do not have to have the ability to plan and organize.
11.0	When it comes to discussion about whether it is essential for young people to own the ability to plan and organize cause it benefits them a lot in their works or studyings.
4.0	Firstly, a good plan enables young people a higher working efficiency and more time saved.
8.0	As we all know, morden life is  pretty stressful and people have to deal with a big number of issues in a short time and it's difficult to keep pace with it for young people who haven't this kind of experience.
8.0	Sometimes young people will be puzzled since they don't know what to do or when to do their works and that's why a good plan is important.
8.0	Young people will exactly know what should be done in what time since everthing has been scheduled in their plans.
8.0	And everytime when they get puzzled about their work, they can still look back to their plans.
8.0	In this way, their time get saved and their working efficiency have improved.
4.0	In addition, the ability to plan and organize makes a young person more outstanding and will benefit their careers.
8.0	In modern society, people often get into the occasion that someone who is able to plan and organize is needed.
8.0	For example, many companies will hold the annual meeting at the end of a year and it must be needed to be held by someone who is good at organizing.
8.0	So, young people having the ability to organize stand out and may impress the leaders in the company.
8.0	Thus, young people will get more oppotunities in their careers.
4.0	Last but not least, young people could accumulate more experince by planning or organizing something.
9.0	It's true that the older ones may do better in planning and organizing.
9.0	But young people also need to accumulate working experience by do the work and then to be the experienced ones.
10.0	So from my perspective, it
12.0	With the develop of ecnomic and sinces, people should work and study constantly to get a better life.
12.0	To keep a good  health, it is necessary for us to do something ralaxing.
12.0	Some people ralaxing themselves by doing physical exercise,  some like to learning something and others want to watch a movie or read a book since they hold the opinin that watching movies or reading books are better than doing sports.
12.0	I strongly disagree with this opinin because by doing physical exercise we can keep our body health and be more responsibility.
6.0	Firstly, sports can help people keep physical health expecially for those people who working in office and studing in classroom.
8.0	Doing physical sports will help thier body keep active and sleeping better.
8.0	For example, my classmate  like football and he play football twice a week with his team.
8.0	By doing this he keep healthy and be engetic all the time.
7.0	Secondly, dio
3.0	With the fast development and the pace of the earth,  teenagers begin to consider that they need establlish their own rule, because most of them want to diiferent with their parents.
11.0	However, in my opinion, I think younger should live under the rules rather than break the rules of society.
11.0	Because the society need steady and peaceful and the rule is not strict..
5.0	First of all, the rule means law in most country, it is the basic factor to keep the  steady scoiety, if people want to break the rule, they will convicted as a criminal.
8.0	For example, my classmate named williams who lived the same dormitory with me.
8.0	Because he wanted differ to others, he bet with his friends that he could eat the rare animals, then, he hunted a rare animal in the forest.
8.0	finally, he went into the prison.
5.0	Secondly, most rule that require us to is simple,  government or our parents just want us to undertake our responsibilities, such as looking to our parents; being a volunteer.
10.0	it is not strict.
0.0	fianlly, although someone say that if non people break the rules, the society will stop developed.
0.0	I agree with this.
0.0	But, i think that any development is based on the forerunner's knowledges,  young people are too young to build a new rule.
7.0	in this time, i think young people should remem
3.0	Recently, an interesting problem that many people discuss about:children spend more time on doing homework or participating in organized activities related to school or sports.
11.0	However, whether they should be given more time to do whatever they want.
11.0	I think children should spend more time to do whatever they want.
12.0	My point can be well illustrated as follows.
4.0	Firstly, children can be more concentrated in the fuild they like.
8.0	If children don't like do something but they must to do, they will fell very miserable to do that and cannot do it well.
8.0	But if children are interested in that filed, the will do it carefully.
8.0	For example, a girl likes drawing very much, and she want to be painter, but her prarents drive her to do sports, this will make the girl cannot do everything well.
8.0	If her parents just let her do what she really want to do, she can put attention on it, and she can be more careful and concentrated.
4.0	Secondly, let children spend proper time in what they what they want to do may help them to release pressrue.
8.0	These days, parents always push their children hard and children always feel tired.
8.0	And do whatever they want sometimes can help us rest ourselves and let us be motivated to do next.
8.0	For me, if I study every day, and just do things my parents or teachers ask me to do, I will fell bored and annoyed.
8.0	But in this time, if I can listen to a music, I can release myself in order to be more active.
4.0	But some people think that children just need to spend more time on doing homework or participating in organized activites related to school sports.
8.0	These are the students' mission.
8.0	But children not just need knowledge and skill, they also need happiness.
8.0	If they are not happy, they may cannot be successful because they don't have motivation.
2.0	For these reasons, I think children should spend be given more time to do whatever they want.
3.0	Recently, a noticiable topic arouse the inmemsely discussion: whether different types of works or similiar tasks all day satisified workers.
3.0	Varied people have distinct sights.
3.0	Some people think similar work can make people focus on the task they do, and people will do well in this work.
3.0	However, I hold the view that different kinds of assignments encourage people a lot.
11.0	My view can be elabrated as follow.
5.0	To begin with, varied tasks cultivate worker the ability of time management.
8.0	If people do many different works in a day, he should make a plan and arrange every hour work he should finish.
8.0	Handle a good work pace to complete all the task.
8.0	However, if a person who similiar work day by day, he will became quickly.
8.0	He will just finish the work without any plan, and he will lose the chance to get the ability of time management.
8.0	Imaging a person, he should make the marketing plan, order the standard work process, accout the revenue, each one of this is complicated, so he have to make the precisely plan in order to finish them.
8.0	It is crystal clearing that workers who want to get the ability of time management satisified in mutiply tasks.
5.0	In addition, different kinds of tasks make workers have creative thinking.
8.0	People are able to find the connection in different works, through which may inspire them improve the working methods and company strategies.
8.0	It is also a kind of creative thinking from interaction of different works.
8.0	In opposite, people who do similiar work all the time will not be access to new thing.
8.0	They can not get insight from the work.
2.0	To sum up, i convince that different is the better onit is not only can develop the time management skills but also get creative thinking and inspiration from doing different types of work.
3.0	When thinking about the issue that whether parents should offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school,different people have different ideas.
3.0	While some people may believe money stimulates children to work hard to get good mark continully, I think that it might cause children to learn just for money other than intrests and fun.
12.0	Parents do expect their children to get good marks in exam, because they want their children to have a brighter future.
4.0	But stimulations like money will let childrens think they learn just in order to earn more money.
8.0	This way copletely ruins the begining of education.
8.0	The principle of education is to build nomative citizions and thus make the future of the society harmonious.
8.0	Using money to stimulate children will make them becoming some people who live for their own intrests.
8.0	So they will be selfish.
4.0	Second, using money as rewards may make cheating in the exam becoming more and more.
9.0	If a child can get good marks in the way of cheat instead of answering the questions honestly, he or she may become a dishonest person.
9.0	The children grow in this way could do anything even illegal to achieve his or her goal in the future.
4.0	Third, although things like money can be a reward to make children work harder in study.
8.0	But it should be limited and not being used frequently.
8.0	We know human like other animals are active to reward.
8.0	But human must live in a more moral way instead of living by stimulates.
8.0	Thats what makes us human different from other anmials.
8.0	We have dreams and rules, and we can enjoy the fun of thinking learning new knowledges.
2.0	After all, it will be better for parents not to use money as a reward for high grade their children get in school.
3.0	Government is an indispensible part in our life, it plays a part of regulating and supporting citizens and the city.
3.0	But sometimes the budget is limited, government has to decide how to allocate the financial money.
3.0	Some people says that as internet plays a more and more important role in our daily life, it's more necessary and essential for the government to put money in improving the access to internet than in improving the public transportation.
11.0	However, I hold the different opinion that it's public transportation is at least as important as the internet.
5.0	To begin with, public transportation benefits people a lot as bring them convenience to wherever they want.
8.0	Although many people in the urban area have the priviate cars already, but there are stills many families don't  own a car.
8.0	For those people, the only way for them to go somewhere far away is to take the public transportation such as bus or subway.
8.0	Even for the families who already have a car, the public transportation is necessary too, for not everyone in the family have the ability to drive, especially young children and elders, when they encounter some difficulties or some emergencys, it's very unconvenience for them to call the their parents or childern who are in their working places back and take a ride.
8.0	Also, it's very cheap, so many people prefer that way to go on a trip.
8.0	For me, I take the subway to shool everyday, and I can't imagine that how unconvinence it might be if the public transportation can't work in this way.
5.0	In addation, it's necessary for the government to improve the public transportation because the demands of the public transportation has been increasing all the time, and the existing routes can not satisfy all the people.
8.0	More and more people now tend to live in the rural aeras but work in the urban aeras.
8.0	It's mainly because that many people can not afford the crazy dramatically increaing house prices and some people also prefer to live in the quiet place to avoid the hustle and bustle of the cities.
8.0	Since there are always long ways for them and traffic jams happen all the time, people are likely to take the public transportation both for saving money and for avoid being late for work.
8.0	But now many public 'transportation has not been developed perfect enough to meet people's need, and subways are too expensive for companys and individuals to bulid, so in my perspective, it's necessary for public to do that for citizens.
8.0	Comparatively the access to internet can be done good enough with the companys, so there is no need for government to do that.
8.0	Lastly, Public power is never less about environment than about economics, public transportation is also a good way to protect the environment.
1.0	So reflecting on those things, it's quite overt that the public transportation is most in need of government's attention.
1.0	There is no doubt that the money should be put into the right place where is necessary and important to provide convenience and nice environment to people living in the city.
11.0	I don't think that offering school-age children money for high grade is a good idea.
3.0	Four reasons will be referred as follows.
11.0	To bedin with,when we in school-age,we dont't exactly know how to use money and realize what parents pay to get these money.
12.0	So the money we get by high grade will become the burren for our parents.
10.0	And we need time to realize the value of money.
4.0	Secondly,if school-age children get money by this way,they will see grade as money,and thinking money can be exchanged by making good scores.
9.0	This think maybe make them try their best to get their scores.
9.0	Such as making a trick in examination or finding others to help theirselves getting high grades to exchange money.
4.0	Thirdly,maybe parents use this way is to encurage their children and improve their interest in study.
8.0	But my thought is that  it will not make their children like study, and it will make their children only try for the money.
8.0	For example,when we have a dream,we will not care about the procress,instead we will only care the dream.
8.0	Because as a person,we can't avoid our desire.
8.0	So we must knows the importance of process that we attain our dream and strengthen our capability.
4.0	Last but not least,parents should use their behaviour to prize their children,rather than using money.
8.0	I think parent's company is more important than money.
8.0	Besides,if parents by giving their children a trip or a skipping,they will try thier best to get the best grades.
8.0	Because,they are children.
8.0	The company for them is better than the money.
10.0	All these reasons are my think
3.0	Have you ever just traveled in your own country because of you think that it is more valuable to enjoy?
3.0	Have you ever always traveled in your own country because of the precious time?
3.0	Have you ever traveled in your own country just for saving money?
11.0	Nevertheless, I believe citizens could learn more from traveling to foreign country.
5.0	Firstly, every foreign countries has their unique views, you could taste more if you travel to foreign coutries.
8.0	Different foreign countries have their different climate conditions and histories.
8.0	Therefore, there are various surprising spectulates you could see in the foreign countries.
8.0	On the contrary, our own country is more monotonous.
8.0	We could see the Big Ben in England; watch Yellow grand tower in China; enjoy the statue of freedom goodness; and speculate the Effeir Tower.
8.0	We could enjoy every the most famous thing in every country if we could travel to foreign countries.
5.0	In addition, the technique are more advanced than ancient time.
9.0	We could travel by planes or trains, which could help us to arrive at a distant place in a really short time.
9.0	I remember when I went to America, I just spent eight hours from Asia to America, the time that spend on the road is really short, so it could not be an excuse to not travel to foreign countries
0.0	Finally, you could learn more through making different friends in various countries.
0.0	People in the same country always have the same idea toward one thing, because of the country's history or the conservatory mind.
0.0	However, if you could make friends in foriegn countries which could help you to renew your mind.
9.0	Take my sister for example, she opened a clothes shop.
9.0	And she always design the simillar style to clothes.
7.0	Nevertheless, after meeting some foreign friend she knew more style about clothes, and she
11.0	I don't think this ia a bad idea,but I don't mean this is a good idea.
5.0	First,we do need something to remote us studying.
8.0	And offering money would be a good idea.
8.0	I believe many students are just like me, wondering what is the  point of studying?
8.0	Parents always tell us to work hard because only in this way can we become a successful people.
8.0	But we don't get their point at all.
8.0	We believe the most important thing is to enjoy life.
8.0	Not spending our whole youth on studying.
8.0	What we need is a real thing to tell us the benefit of learning.
8.0	We always have something we want to buy.
8.0	So if we could get money from getting a high mark on test ,we would spend more time on studying in order to get money.
8.0	So that is why I say it is not a bad idea.
5.0	But every thing has two sides.
8.0	The bad influence of offering money is that they would ask for more,not just money.
8.0	One example is a classmate of my.
8.0	She dosen't really put her heart on studying but just to request for more money.
8.0	And every time she gets a good grade she asks for more money.
8.0	She even cheated on exams just to get a good grade.
8.0	So that she can ask her father to give her more money.
8.0	Unfortunately,she didn't do well on a important exam and his father refuses to give her more money.
8.0	She gives up studying now and has nothing to do.
7.0	So offering money is not a bad idea but n
12.0	With the well develpoement of current community, less and less people will choose to do exersice instead watching movies and reading a book.
12.0	For they need to pay enormous energy into their works, that means they do not have enough attention to pay on their physical health.
12.0	As time goes by, people has weaker bodies and sense of keeping health.
12.0	And the enviorment is getting much worse than before,so we need stonger bodies to support our works.
11.0	In my opinion,it is not better to relax by watching movies or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.
4.0	First and forement, doing exercise is better because it will provide us with more energy to work.
8.0	As doing exercise can help us to make our body stronger, then we can do our work much better.
8.0	Take my friend Dave as an example, he liked to eat junk food and watching movies in his spare time.
8.0	Just like you could imagine, he was quite fat and lazy.
8.0	He told me many time that he enjoys his spare time, and I had told him many times to change this bad habit.
8.0	Seeing that, he could not pay a long attention to our teacher and he began to get sick much easier.
8.0	After he began doing exercise, he generally started to conqur all of these problems.
8.0	I guess that's why I support ro doing exercise.
4.0	On top of that,it could help us to get to know the outside world better.
8.0	When we are doing sports, we can just enjoy the sight nearby and communicate with our teammates and make friends.
8.0	For instance, my classmate John, he just liked reading a book in his spare time.
8.0	And that made a really big problem.
8.0	He could not communicate well with us.
8.0	He could not even join in our topic!
8.0	What's more, he nearly lost the skill to make friend.
8.0	Just after he began to do sport, he has more chance to get to know us and we are likly to make friends with him now.
8.0	Form this event, I think doing sport is a better way to relax.
4.0	However, reading books and watching movies are not a bad way to choose to relax.
9.0	For it can make you totally empty and get into another world.
9.0	But still, doing sport is better because it can make your life colorful and meaning more.
0.0	All in all, I state that doing physical exercise is better than the other two.
0.0	As it can provide our work with more energy and help us to know the outside world better.
0.0	And i believe when you do it, you will feel the enjoyment and your life quality will be much better.
12.0	With the development of the ecnomic, the education has became more and more important in this society.
8.0	Parents loved their child so much that they couldn't stand the injury in their kids.
8.0	It is difficult for parents to sit back and allow their children to make mistakes .
8.0	Although they know the bad effects of the boiled children, but they can't control themself.
8.0	However, at some point part of children's develop, what a good parent do is just letting their children go and watching them to do some mistakes.
8.0	No matter how much they want to help their children, all of childs need to have the freedom to make mistakes and learn from them.
5.0	To begin with, trails and errors can be the greatest lessons.
8.0	Children experience what it feels like to do stupid things so they learn that making poor desicions not turning out well for them.
8.0	This bad experience will leave them a unforgetable memorize and teach them to know what should do and what shouldn't.
8.0	This experience will also help them making their dreams clearly.
8.0	The things I need to do is to study harder and harder.
8.0	Although I failed a test, and since then I always learn to write down the important things, the teacher's points, the problems I need to ask...
8.0	and something else.
8.0	The child can also learn how to use his or her time in a more efficient way, which the child may not understand if the parents just talk to his or her.
5.0	In addition,perhaps the best way to free children's activity is to ask them to stop being afraid of making mistakes.
8.0	Edison invented the bump after thousands time loses.
8.0	Indeed, what mistakes do can offer us the opportunity to explore beyond where we thought we are going.
8.0	So if a child tell his parents that he want to try something.
8.0	just let him to go and allow him to make mistakes, learn to accept the lose of your child.
8.0	It doesn't means that tour child is a loser, instead it i
3.0	Sophisticated technology ,explosive informations and intricate relationships all these factors together lead to our modern world.
3.0	"So I have to say here ""how faster our world is developing "" ,accompanied  with this development."
3.0	some reasonable but weird problems  also come about like people  now are  less happy than before.
11.0	In my opinion,I agree with the statement that nowaday people are less statisfied with their lives than people were in the past .
5.0	Although our lives become more colorful ,our burdens are also increasing a lot in modern world due to some pressure from work or study.
8.0	Take my experience as a example ,I still remenber when I was in the elementary school ,without today's technological productions like ipad or smart phone ,I thought my life is really happy .
8.0	Everday after school I could make a appointment with my little friends to play some simple games such as shooting the glass balls or riding bike  on the road .
8.0	We did not care others's views on us ,it  was a real childhood .
8.0	Contemporary people 's lives change  a lot.
8.0	There are an increasing number of entertainments for them to have fun ,whereas, they are not stress out because of pressures from all aspects .
8.0	They don't even have time to enjoy the equipment for fun ,and diving into the trivial and endless work .
8.0	compared to lives in before I am sympathic with modern lives .
5.0	Moreover,treasures  in this world are  plentiful,people are desired to chase for them and forget the real happiness of our life --to be ordinary to be frugal .
8.0	My mother always tells me and my sister that remember your life goal and stick to it .
8.0	She thinks this is the correct way which a human being will chose.
8.0	And after I graduate from university to find a job Iget its meaningness.
2.0	Although ,nowaday people have coloful facilities to have fun ,it cannot be avoided to feel lonely ,Mobile phone make people closer also separate people ,it has bin-bleeds.
7.0	If I have choicedefinite
3.0	I disagree that watching movies or reading is better than exercising in relax.
11.0	As a student, i believe that doing physical exercise is always the best way to relax myself.
6.0	To begin with,taking exercise does a great deal to improve our healty.
8.0	As a university student,i spend most of my time in studying with staying indoor.
8.0	I can have a breath of fresh air when doing sports.
8.0	I can also improve my fitness with reguler exercises.
8.0	I had tried to relax by watching movies which was enjoying at first time,but i realized the harm to my healty.
8.0	I can not see the blackboard clearly after watching the computer for a long time to watch the movies and i felt tired when concentrated on the class.
8.0	So i do not think watching movies is a good way to have a relax.
1.0	Furthermore,doing sports can make many friends.
1.0	I do some sports at morning every day.
7.0	On the way to the
3.0	If you have two choices: one is to be a teacher in the past and another one is to teach in nowadays, which one would you choose?
12.0	From my perspective, because of more respects can gotten in ancient time, I wll choose the former one.
12.0	Specific reasons are listed below.
5.0	Only few teahcers are existed in the past and getting knowledge from teacher is a very sumptuous things,  teachers wil be appreciated more.
8.0	Confucius, an famouse teacher in ancient China, is the best example to illustrte this statement.
8.0	He is the only man who get lore from other teachers in their vilage, so all the families wanted he can be the teacher of their children to increse their families' state, which means  knowledge indicates their states.
8.0	Thus, a bunch of luxury clothes, percelain, jewlry and so on were given by them to Confucius.
8.0	In addition, all the viligers will greet he politely in order to win his love to admmit their children.
8.0	Apparantly, teachers in the past can gain more repect due to the current situation in the past society.
8.0	However, today's society is quite the opposite oweing to nowaday's characteristic, which I will mention below.
5.0	In  nowadays, teacher's population become larger and even overflows the limited amount, which means parents will evaluate their children's teachers and only like to find their shortcomings.
8.0	Take my mother, a middle school teacher, as an example.
8.0	On the contrary, what my mother always get is the critical comment from her students' parents when just a little error is made by my mother.
8.0	And then, they think my mother is not a good teacher and change my mother by a new one immediately without some time to explain.
8.0	That is because, they think there are many teachers in today's society and they can find other one who are better than my mother a lot.
10.0	In summarize, teacher in the
12.0	I think it is a good idea.
12.0	On the one hand,offer money for children is an encouragement for them which can give them more confident to do better.
12.0	if children did not get something after they did well in study,they would be frustrated.
12.0	Some money can give children a chance to buy something they want and be confident of themsleves.
8.0	they would like to do well next time.
8.0	For example,when I was in high school,i did not do well in math.
8.0	one afternoon,when my parents konw my math text grade which is very terrible,they did not blame at me,they told me they would give me some money if I could get good grades next time.
8.0	From then on,I tried my best to learn math and got good grades in the final exam.
6.0	On the other hand,offer money can let children konw that money is hard-earned.
8.0	Nowadays,many children live without economic pressure that makes them waste money sometimes.
8.0	study hard to earn money is a good way to educate children,so that they will think more before they pay for something expensive.
8.0	As for me,to make my math better,I got up very early evryday to memorize the formulas and went to bed very late to do a lot of exercises.
8.0	However,when I got good grades in the final exam,I could not wait to tell my parents the good news,they praised me and gave me just ten yuan.
7.0	After the experience,I totally konw that
3.0	With the televisons and seeing movie being more affordable for most of families, there is a discussion whether the movies and televison contribute to a negative effect or a positive effects.
11.0	As for me, I would prefer the latter for following reasons.
5.0	Admittly, watching moive or televiton may cause some bad ending occasionally, however this issue depends on how long peoples spend on and what the contents are.
9.0	If there are lots of violent scenes, it may lid a nice child turn into a bad-temple troublemaker.
9.0	But in constract, with more suitable orientations, movies and televison will have a numerous benefits.
5.0	To begin with, movies and televison, about education, not only can provide the audiences with extensive knowledge but also make their life more coloful.
8.0	To be more specific, like the history movies.
8.0	When I was just a 6 years old chil, who hated studying.
8.0	One night, my mother suggested me to see a movie, named Roman Empire.
8.0	It was really impressed, and I was attracted to history at that moment.
8.0	Form this movies, I learnt how the Rome Empire was builded up from a small village.
8.0	The ancient Roman invented an advanced building material, a special concrete, which would harden under water.
8.0	With this amazing technology, the Rome could build better bridges across the wide rivers to transport the equipments and goods with wegons and cars.
8.0	As a result, the small village grew up to a powerful empire which was famous for trade.
8.0	Therefor, I think that an educational movie can broaden the horizen and teach us a lot.
12.0	Nowadays, a considerable number of people, holding the idea that students shouldn't take any part time jobs while they are studying in the university, claim that part time jobs will waste them a large amount of time.
11.0	However, personally speaking, I don't agree with their opinion.
12.0	I advocate that taking part time jobs will take the students much more benefits.
11.0	There are two main reasons to support my claim.
5.0	There is no doubt that spending too much time on part time jobs will have negetive influence on the students' study because those part time jobs will take the students too much time and they may be find it not easy to have enough time for study.
8.0	However, spending appropriate amount of time on part time jobs can be beneficial.
8.0	Firstly, the main reason to support my opinion is that part time jobs is good for our future career and our future life.
8.0	We can learn far more from the jobs than what we can acquired from classes, such as how we can cooperate with others, and how we can solve some sudden events.
8.0	Those experiences are doubtlessly good for us, because we may face all these problems in our future life, and if we have solved them once, we can deal with them more easily.
8.0	For example, one of my classmates used to take a part time job in the library, and now, after graduate, he can find the job much more easier than those who have never take a part time job.
5.0	Another factor why I agree with the above statement is that taking a part time job can lighten our economic pressure.
9.0	As many students who have well academic performance don't grow in the wealthy families, and it is not easy for those families to pay for the fee for college, taking a part time job for those students seems to be necessary.
9.0	Even for those students who don't need to care about the tuition, the salary from a part time job can make their life more colorful because they may have much more free money to eat out campus rather than just have meals in the cafe, or they can have fun with friends on weekends.
2.0	In a nutshell, what we have mentioned above, when taken together, are in favor of the point that taking part time jobs is beneficial for students.
3.0	During the class, teachers will always ask some students to announce their opinions about questions and they will correct the mistake part of the answers.
3.0	However, if some student are stuck with their own opinions, they may not listen to the teachers and just interrupt the class to refute the teacher.
3.0	The other cases is that the students will just be slience about that.
12.0	I think that the best way to deal with this situation is waiting until the class is over and then talk with the teacher to disscuss about the mistake.
4.0	First of all, if teachers point out the mistake from student's answer, the answer usually will be wrong or odd.
8.0	Therefore, students have to talk to their teachers about the errors and try to correct that because it is very important to find and solve the problems during the studying.
8.0	for example, a student is asked to answer this question and his professor just says that there are faults in his answer.
8.0	At that time, if the student comes to the professor's office and has a conversation with the professor about the inaccuracy, he can know which part of this sbuject he doesn't master or understand it.
8.0	Though this opportunity, he can review this unit and strength his understanding about that part which can benefit his test.
4.0	In addition, even though one can correct his opinion immediately at the class by interrupting the teacher, his understanding and memory about that question is still unstable and inaccurate.
8.0	More inportantly, it is very unrespectful and rude to just interrupt someone when he or she is talking no speaking of he or she is your teacher.
8.0	When one disturbs the class, many students will be affected and their time is wasted because a student wants to correct his answer.
8.0	Thus, it is a really selfish behavior to bother the class and students' learing.
4.0	Finally, saying nothing is even worse than interrupt the class because one can't learn anything from the mistake if he doesn't care about that error.
8.0	It seems like that it is the best way to deal with this situation because it will not even bother the teachers.
8.0	However, students will not learn anything.
8.0	Therefore, even though the professor points out the mistakes, it is useless to do that since you don't even want to correct that.
2.0	In conclusion, I think the best way to dispose  this condition is waiting for the class is over and talk with your professor about that.
3.0	I don't think it's a good idea for parents offer their children money when they get higher mark.
11.0	For this oppion, I would like to  give 3 reasons.
4.0	Firstly, study is the duty of students, they did not need any money to encourage.
9.0	All they need is caring from parents, they do not need any money.
9.0	Only caring from parents will bring up children's motivation.
4.0	In addition, parents should build up the oppion for children that you are not study for me, it's all good for yourself.
9.0	This oppion is will have a good influence for the children, it will be useful after they get in to sosialty.
9.0	If parents do this, children can also cultivate by them.
10.0	Last but not least, parents earn money outside, is not easy they work very hard, they don't have the duty to provide children money to keep them study better.
4.0	Maby it's not believable, so I will give you a example about my oppion.
8.0	In my senior school, one child called Jack have the same experience with the Topic.
8.0	HIs parent encourage he study by gave he money.
8.0	It seem working very well at first, he get a good grade and his parent is also think its' worthy.
8.0	But good thing does not last long.
8.0	After get a lot of money from his parent, he by himself a smartphone and stood up late to play it.
8.0	Not soon, his geade falling rapitely and his parent discover taht he is addict to smartphone.
8.0	So his Mom take his phone away and stop give him money to encourage he.
8.0	After that, he lost the mind to study and argue with his parents about the question about hia money.
8.0	No sonner then, he becam one of those bad child.
2.0	In a word, I think there are no any advantage for parents to give money to  their children when they get higher mark.
3.0	Nowadays, in order to encourage school-age children to get high grade, some parents come into the idea that they can give money to children for each high mark they get in school.
3.0	Of course it is a good method for high score and it will encourage the students to be more hardworking.
3.0	However, the disadvantages overweight the advantages.
11.0	Using money to ecouraging students may be useful at the beginning, but it can give bad influence on children's longterm development,making they to compare and fail to establish their ideal.
5.0	To see in the short term, money is a great gift in children's eyes and they are definitely willing to learn harder for money.
9.0	As a result, they get high grades in school, and at the same time, more money.
9.0	Both the parents and children would be satisfied with this results.
5.0	However, to see in a long term, it is not a good deal.
8.0	Firstly, when students all learn hard to earn money, they might compare with each other who have more money but not who get a higher grades.
8.0	Different families can afford diffirent amout of money for high marks.
8.0	Such comparison between students may lead to the thought of students in poor families that they are not as wealthy as others and is of course, not what we expect to happen.
8.0	Secondly, just consider what is the students study for?
8.0	It is not the knowledge or even a high grade that they study for, but the money.
8.0	School-age children are just too young to recognize that what is the most important thing.
8.0	They see things easiy and all they can learn through the deal is that they study to earn money and they can buy CDs, games using the money they earn.
8.0	However, a good society should educate children to learn for themselves, learn for science and even for their society and country.
8.0	Students that are well-educated should have great ideals but not just dream of making more money.
8.0	Such deals are not beneficial for students to construct their concept of value and the world and an outstanding dream.
1.0	In conclusion, although offering money to school-age children for a high grade may be effective at the beginning, it can give bad influence on children's longterm development.
1.0	Thus parents should not do this but let the students learn for themselves a good grade instead.
3.0	About relatatoin ,i think whtch a movie or read a book is btetter than do physical exercise.
3.0	Watching the movie and reading the book is a kind of entertainment.
3.0	When people doing these things,our body is relaxed,our spirit is relaxed too.
3.0	I like watching movies and reading books to relax.
3.0	I can sit on the roof,there is a cup of the tea on the table,bask in the sun,and enjoy the scenery of nature.
12.0	I can take a book at this time,reading book on slowly.
5.0	Of cause i can lie in my bed while watching the movie while eating snacks.
8.0	That is so easy and relax.
8.0	Don't need to walk around,don't need to exercise.
8.0	Nothing needs to be done,just rest.
5.0	when i feel tired,what i need now is just rest.,no disturb,no exercise,just give me a book or a computer,let me be readed a book or watched a movie.
10.0	This is the rest.
1.0	As for physical exercise,is too tired.
1.0	Don't deny doing physical exercise can
3.0	Nowadays, finding job is mush harder than past.
3.0	Should people take a secure job first or just wait for a job that would be more satisfying?
11.0	I think it is good way to get the secure right away.
4.0	At first, working in a secure job can bring you the working experience that may need for better job.
8.0	Many company tend to hire people that have working experience today.
8.0	And we can laern many useful things from the secure job.
8.0	For example, one of my friend was major in computer science.
8.0	After graduation, he chose to work in KFC rather than wait for a more satisfying job.
8.0	During this work, he learn many things  about how a restaurant worked.
8.0	A year later, he got a really good job in a Internet campony, because the boss here wanted to make a APP about take-out food.
8.0	He is the only one who know both computer and restaurant.
8.0	So the job that we may not very like may bring more than just money to us.
4.0	On the other hand, take a job first can earn money.
8.0	If some one have aleady graduated from school and he has no job, it must be his perants give his money to live.
8.0	It not a really good thing, right?
8.0	Getting a job can make money without the help of your family, your family can spend money in more important things.
8.0	My uncle's son have finished his school work for four years, but he does not find a good job until now.
8.0	It takes his family a big amount of money to feed him.
8.0	Because of that, my uncle stops driving car to save money.
8.0	It does make some problem.
8.0	So I think a person should find a job as soon as he can.
4.0	Although a satisfying job seems very appealing.
8.0	But you can find job when you work in a secure job.
8.0	That is a very common thing now.
8.0	If you find a more satisfying job, you can leave your job and take the job interview.
8.0	So you can find job while working instead of just waitting.
1.0	Many successful people have getten more than one job.
1.0	So it is a good idea to the the secure job first.
12.0	Coupled whth the process of civilization is a hot debate on whether young people today have no influence on the important decisions that determine the future of society as a whole or not.
11.0	As far as I am concerned, young people have some influence on some significant decisions.
5.0	First of all, as we all konw, the PC manufaturer, Apple, made a decision to push out the personal computer at firt.
8.0	Because of the arise of PC, people are able to work more efficiently.
8.0	However, no one could think little of the affection from the young people, Jobs.
8.0	Without his original idea and his efforts on how to make the computer portable, maybe we are unable to witness the high popularity rate of personal computer today as well as the drmadic deveolopment of technology.
5.0	Second, Bill Gates, a young people who built his own firm, made a decision to develop the Internet which
10.0	In addition,
10.0	To put it in a nutshell,
11.0	When we talk about the youth influence, it may arouse the debate: whether young people today have influence on importance decisions that determine the future society as a whole.
11.0	Some people believe that nowadays, youth have no influence on the essensial determination about future society.
11.0	But I am convincing that current young people have strong effect on the decision about future.
11.0	My view can be illustrated as follows.
5.0	First, young people have many ways to express their idea.
8.0	They can update their idea on the social media, send letters to the people who have decisive power and organize the all youth people to show there statement.
8.0	With all of this pathway, the decisive men will notice the young people's position and consider about youth's idea.
8.0	For example,the student union of Wuhan Univeristy have been argue the goverment's decision about increase the student who can enter the university.
8.0	The students said that the univerisity had deficient professor and other employee, if  government improve the number of entrance student, all the students may face to studying and living problem.
8.0	The top school in the middle China cannot provide excellent talents to the society.
8.0	The related departments obtain the massege and decided not to increasing the junior students.
5.0	Second, young people can creat new invention.
8.0	Young men have enough energy, time and passion to innovation.
8.0	So they can creat many new thing like the car without driver.
8.0	This way, the govement should concern about the safety about the new techology or invents, whether beneficial or negative to society.
8.0	For example, the students in the Zhejiang  University have invented the robot that can accompany with little children and relief the parent's pressure.
8.0	Prior to enter to marker, the goverment agency will examine the production and be sure it will positive to child and parents.
8.0	With the agency's permmittion, they can produce the robot.
8.0	In the future, parents just do their work and the robot will help child doing homework, play with them.
2.0	To sum up, youth is crucial part in future dicision.
12.0	Some parents require their children to choose jobs similar to those of themselves, while other parents are more open-minded and let their children to choose whatever they like to do.
11.0	When it comes to the problem whether children should choose jobs that are similar to their parents' job or choose jobs that are very different from their parents' jobs, opinions vary from person to person.
11.0	Personally, I think it is better for children to choose jobs thatts' jobs, with clear instructions and much more sophisticated experience.
4.0	First, these children can get valuable instructions from their parents, which is vital to the begining of a career.
8.0	As we know, to initiate a career is challenging, as we do not know what to do and how to do it.
8.0	Some children may, out of interest, choose some jobs that are very different from their parents' jobs.
8.0	They will meet with a lot of obstacles, some of whom succeed after lots of faillures and some of whom just give up.
8.0	One of my schoolmates speaks English very well, and then takes a job as an interpretor.
8.0	She told us that her mother was an interpretor, who trained her a lot to spoke English well.
8.0	Children can learn a lot of valuable instructions from their parents if they chood the some jobs of their parents.
4.0	Second, these children can have more sophisticated experience of one job due to his living atmosphere, thus they may develop interests about it.
8.0	It is obivous that we may have little knowledge about the careers we never have any touch.
8.0	Children may more or less aquire something about their parents' jobs.
8.0	For example, one of my friends run his own business when he was in high school.
8.0	His father was a businessman, and thus my friend always know business informations we did not know.
8.0	What surprised us most was that he even knew how to operate a project.
8.0	Some of word he told to us about business was unknown to all of us.
8.0	Because these children are more familiar with their parents' jobs, they can do much better in their career.
4.0	Admittedly, some children may abhor their parents' jobs due to various reasons, and so they may choose very different from their parents' jobs.
9.0	Maybe, they have their own interests.
9.0	Nevertheless, the success of  a career depends a lot on experience and instructions.
10.0	All to all, I believe
11.0	When it comes to the issue about whether or not people are more willing to give strangers a hand, we have different opinions.
12.0	Personally speaking, I support that our generation today are more kind and enthusiastic.
11.0	Even though we do not know each other, we also like helping others who are in trouble.
11.0	My reasons are as follow.
5.0	The first point make is that we need more helps from other people in such a complex society.
8.0	With the development of transportation, there are more and more individual drivers.
8.0	It means more and more dangers for singel lady outdoors.
8.0	So they must be careful and always need help when they are in danger.
8.0	As a enthusiastic dweller, we should be willing to help them all the time.
8.0	Becouse we can not predict our condition.
8.0	And we don't know whenever we will meet danger.
5.0	In the second place, a larger number of people are in the same space at the same time.
9.0	While helping others, we are helping ourselves.
9.0	By helping the struggling strangers, we can build a harmonious society and creat a wa
1.0	In a word, people are willing to hlep the struggling strangers.
1.0	This is not only for them, but also for ourselves.
3.0	For a school age children, I think offer them money for each high mark is a good idea.
11.0	Now most improtant thing is this question is not clearly for plan.
11.0	We do not know the money is lot or not.
11.0	That is have two differences.
5.0	During the school age, we need much time to grow and think.
8.0	The high mark in school made me sad or happy.
8.0	Sad, because you need to keep you work and do better in next combat.
8.0	happy, just a perrty word for others.
8.0	This work never ending.
5.0	High mark, is a kind of honor.
8.0	Most is for parents, not own.
8.0	They want to keep that also, parents need that.
8.0	Many high mark you have paid too much, lost always by your side.
8.0	You might want some gift, parents also know you mind, they do not know how to make you happy, just said, give you money to handing out?
8.0	in fact that nagtive idea is for me, not for every one.
8.0	people want better tomrrow, they work hard in school family, high garde is good ending for you study, you should feel happy, and you parents also feel you grow, They want to make you greater, want give you gift, but they might  not know what you want, give you money to get what you want.
8.0	Is a good idea, is kind of love, or care about you.
2.0	At last you do not need lot, just sample, because it is not you money, not from you work, but is best wish from your parents, hope you work with the best parents in world ever.
11.0	Nowadays, peopla are paying an increasing amount if attention to the ways to motivate children to learn.
12.0	Some parents believe that rewarding children money for each high grade they get in school.
12.0	In my point of view, this statement is reasonableand efficient.
12.0	My view will be explained by analyzing the following reasons.
5.0	First of all, offering children money when thy get good grades could encourage children to keep working hard.
9.0	Almost all children want to have thier own money, so if they find their good grades will help them to get money reward, they may work even harder to maintain their knowledge, and try their best to get excellent mark in the next exam.
9.0	As time passesm, they will not only gain rich knowledge, but also develop a good study habit.
5.0	Secondly, the money for children could help them have a sense of money management.
8.0	If children only spend their parents' money, they will not kown how to save money and spend mone recklessly.
8.0	However, if children have money which is owned by them, they will be raletively careful on saving money.
8.0	They will no even buy any useless things.
8.0	This is a significant improvement in their personalities.
2.0	Last but not least, money as a reward is easy for parents to prepare.
7.0	Parents always spend massive efforts to guess what th
3.0	In past time, we just got up and started our simple or singal task when sun rose up, then went to bed when sun set off.
3.0	With the develpment of modern world, life becomes more and more complicated.
11.0	Simultaneously, the debate that whether youth should have the ability to plan and organize is rising.
12.0	I firmly believe young people are suggested to be equiped with this ability.
5.0	In the first place, excellent ability to plan and organize can facilites people with learning more new skills and stuff.
8.0	This age is a information-booming period.
8.0	Totally new stuff bring up every minute and the whole society have asked people to catch up with them.
8.0	Thus, people have to learn skills and aquire knowledge as much as possible.
8.0	Good ability to plan can help people to study pointingly through analyzing their advantages and shortcomings.
8.0	This encourage people not to waste time on some unnessary things.
8.0	Therefore, ability to plan and organize can be extremely beneficial for study fresh stuff.
5.0	Moreover, people excelling in planning and organizing work are more possible to get promotion.
8.0	In work days, we have to face a heavy load of assignments.
8.0	Accomplishing them before deadline with high quality is often required.
8.0	In this regard, making a plan or organization become crucial.
8.0	Imagine that if one face a vast amount of tasks , and have no idea of how to arrange them, he may mess everything up.
7.0	Only goo
3.0	I disgree with the statement.
11.0	I think that doing physical exercise is better than watching a movie or reading a book.
4.0	Firstly,physical exercise is a good way to let people become healthy,and have a perfect body figure.
8.0	When I have a tense daytime,I often go to the gym and do some exercise,such as running or yoga.
8.0	I am very enjoy the sweating after exercise.
8.0	what's more important thing is,after sitting the chair all the daytime,exercise can be a better way to relax our muscle,and feel more comfortable.
4.0	Secondly,we can make more friends through doing exercise.
9.0	It's a good way to share our feelings.
9.0	We can not only talk about sports,but also share our pressures.
4.0	Some people thinks that watching a movie or reading a book is better for them to relax.
8.0	Everyone has their own way to relax.
8.0	however,in my opinion,sometimes we just have no time to watch a movie.
8.0	In addition, it takes a lot of time to read a book.
8.0	So maybe watch movie or read book not as effective as exercise.
2.0	Fanally,in my eyes,I think doing exercise have more benefitial than watching a movie or reading a book.
10.0	We
3.0	To be honest is becoming more and more important in our daily life.
3.0	Have you known some persons choose to tel a lie to their friends on their birthday so that they can give a surprise to the friends?
3.0	Besides, have you noticed the situation where the civilian doesn''t give his or her ticket fee when netering the subway and is caught by the police?
3.0	Have you ever reminded you were criticized by your parents for your dishonesty?
11.0	Through all the things above, we can indicate that telling the truth is not the best the choice at all circumstances.
5.0	First, when you want to give someone a surprise without letting him or her knows, you'd better not tell the person the truth.
8.0	For example, when a friend of mine was going to celebrate his birthday, we gave no reaction to his any behavior.
8.0	And I believed he was extremely let down by us.
8.0	And he almost angry with us for not remembering his birthday and didn't want to be our friends any more.
8.0	In fact, when he went back to his home at night, we all appeared and gave him a huge surprise which made him very delightful.
8.0	Can we have this effect if we had told the truth to him previously?
8.0	Obviously not, so sometimes not telling the truth may be better.
5.0	But in some other situations, the honesty is significant.
8.0	We can take an student who went German for further study.
8.0	I read this story on a book.
8.0	The first time she took the bus in German, she found a error of the system, through which she could take a bus without any expense.
8.0	And she thought she was so lucky, and since then, whenever she took a bus to somewhere she chose to escape the ticket fee.
8.0	At last, she was refused by a company for dishonesty when being interview for a job.
8.0	That was what she needed to pay for her dishonesty.
8.0	Excatly, others know the truth they can escape the ticket fee, but they thought the truth is important.
8.0	So they told the truth, giving the fee that they need to pay.
0.0	Lastly, telling a truth is crucial when you are talking with a child, because the child need to be educated how telling the truth is significant.
0.0	Because in case of this, they won't be a liar in the future.
0.0	When I was small, I stole my deskmate's book because I liked that book so much.
0.0	But I didn't tell my parents the truth.
0.0	After they knew this, they asked me to apologize to my deskmate and give the book back to him.
0.0	I think they are teaching me the honesty is something that we cannot lost as a child.
3.0	As the society evolving and developing in such a high pace,  the whole globe is becoming much more compact.
3.0	Since the correspondence between regions and continents grows more intense and close, it is believed by some that it is virtually important for us to know about events happening around the world, even it seems unrelated to our daily life in the current.
12.0	According to my oponion, I am strongly in favor of this statement.
5.0	The world is becoming smaller, but it does not necessarily mean that the issues happening in a neighbor country will not affect our life in the homeland.
8.0	Many people believe that they do not run big corperations or something bigger than that, thus it is not their concern to pay attentiont to macroeconomic environment.
8.0	Their chief purpose is just to focus on their work at hand in order to sustain themselves.
8.0	Whereas, better understanding of the issue happening in the larger sacle indeed helps people to obtain a general idea about the likelihood of the future prosperity in their own field.
8.0	Take the business of online shopping for example.
8.0	The CEO of Alibaba, Ma Yun, just decided to creat his company right after he paid a visit to the United State, which firmed his blief of the future properous business direction.
5.0	Besides, knowing what is taking place around the world also helps people to get a foundamental common sense.
8.0	It is showed in an interview,  that one of the several critical ingredients belived to be the keystone of their success by those palce-goers, is their common sense.
8.0	They spend large chunks of time on reading news and gather information,  merely aiming at figuring out what is happening around the world, or what is changing the world.
8.0	That is to say, they try to have as full-pictured views as possible based on these facts and events they have known about the world.
8.0	With a ouverall perpective, they said they were endowed with the power to make right decisions to make them succeed.
0.0	Adimittedly, this process will cost a lot of time and resources, and sometimes it even seems to be a waste if it does not yield immediate retribution.
0.0	However, knowing more about this world we live in, it also becomes more likely that people can change the world by merely one brilliant idea.
0.0	And looking for the infomation about the world itself can be interesting and amusing since it really broaden our horizen with amazing experiences of others or in other regions, which we may not undergo through out entire life.
3.0	Such is human nature that we are in need of pauses during our long life journey.
3.0	An interesting phnomenome is that Chinese crowded in cinemas or other enterianments while a typical American choose the jym.
11.0	I prefer the American lifestyle----doing physical exercise plays a better role in ways to relax.
12.0	On the one hand, it's more benifitial for human brain.
12.0	On the other hand, it costs less.
4.0	According to a recent survey, means of entertainment assume our brain just as the way studying or working does, varying in different degrees.
8.0	After watching a rather long and complicated movie or novel, you may indulge in the plot and have a hard time get back to yourself, which is by no means a consequence of a good relaxation.
8.0	Whereas, your brain is forced to block out all the thoughts when you are doing physical exercising.
8.0	Thus, your brain is fourtunate enough to get a good relax without running continously to reflect the content you obtain in a movie or book.
4.0	Secondly, and distinctly, physical exercises like jogging and mountain-climbing cost you almost no money.
9.0	A VIP card of an excellent gym a year may be cheaper than dozens of books and movie tickets.
9.0	Neverthless, a healthy and fit body, free from hospital and heaith-care, is the priceless gift you are presented alongside a relaxation for yourself.
4.0	People tend to search for a movie or book to relax themselves mostly because it always takes steel-like will to hold on to a regular phsical exercise.
8.0	That is the truth.
8.0	However, as is known to all, harder things are with better return.
8.0	What' more, you are to be used to it and enjoy your exercise as long as you stick to it and taste the joy and comfortable feeling.
0.0	Watching a movie or reading a book will of course help you feel better under pressure, but physical exercising is actually what relax your brain and function better in a lower cost.
0.0	Whenever you feel overwhelmed, go for a running or visit the jgm.
0.0	You will get better!
3.0	As the goes, people treat education more important than before.
3.0	The parents of school-aged children are always try to encourage their children to study harder.
3.0	The most common way to deal with this problem, parents always offer their children money for each high mark that their children get in school.
11.0	It is also the way which can make students study harder with the most significant phenomenon.
4.0	To begin with, the students now have high abilities to spend their money, so they need money to satisfied their school lives.
8.0	If parents provides this way to their children, it is a good way to encourage them.
8.0	The students may study very hard to try to gain the cash.
8.0	They will do they best to get good grade to delight parents.
8.0	"But actually, it is really a effective way to help students"" study."
4.0	Another reason that make me agree with the topic is that financial supervise is a very important lesson for children`s future.
8.0	It`s the compulsory course for students.
8.0	So, parents can use this method to train their children how to deal with money, how to treat cash flow.
8.0	Kill two birds with just one rock, why not do that?
4.0	But there also limitations with this method, because children now with these ages cannot control themselves easily, they may attract by the charisma of money, so they may lose themselves.
8.0	It`s such a shame that hurt children but with a warm heart.
8.0	So this method of encourage children study harder exist drawbacks.
8.0	In addition, the children may use money with large amounts.
8.0	It`s a burden of parents to make such a choice.
1.0	So, offer students money is a double-edged sword, it has both advantages and disadvantages in one time.
1.0	In that case,   I partly agree with the statement, Study hardly is important for children`s future, but the healthy grows it`s meaningful for children, too.
3.0	If you are a person who haven't been a leader before, how would you feel if you want to be a leader in an important project in a big company, but the boss just ignore your willingness for you have no experience at all?
3.0	How would you feel if you are chosen to be a leader but gradually find out that you can not arrange all the stuff properly?
10.0	Leadership is a talent that very few people have.
11.0	As far as I am concerned, leadership comes naturally and no one is able to learn to be a leader.
6.0	For one thing, it is of little possibily for a person who haven't been a leader before to be admitted to be a leader, so he has no chance to gain the leadership ability, which will result in a close-circle loop in the end.
9.0	For example, if I were the boss of a big company, I wouldn't take risks to choose a person who have no experience to leader a whole team, because if something terrible like making the wrong choice for the lack of experience really happen, the company may lose a lot of money and may even worse lose the accredit in the field.
9.0	So the person who want to learn to be a leader has little chande to gain the opportunity.
10.0	For another, the
3.0	Nowadays, soceity competition is getting more intense.
11.0	Some people belive do your best of yourself is most important, do not need to care about other things which has no connect with you.
11.0	However, I argue that we cannot live without caring the world, eventhouglth you are students or adult.
12.0	Know what happening around world is very necessarily.
5.0	Frist, know what happending around world can help you live better in this world, can make you easier to get into this society.
8.0	You can know how the world it is, and more clear.
8.0	Some people believe the world is totally nice, because they do not see the other side of the world.
8.0	For example, my sister only had 6 years old, my mother always told her when she goes out, should not chat with strangers, they all bad man.
8.0	My mother gived her this kind of suggestion, beause there are manykidnap events in this world, maybe it do not happend on ourself, but it exsit.
8.0	My sister believe everyone in this world is very firendly, because she does not know much about the world.
8.0	With age older, she will know, because more information and event she will get.
8.0	When you know more, you can easily to protect youself.
5.0	In addtion, know what happening atound world can open your mind and insight.
8.0	It can be some topics when you chat with other mates.
8.0	More you know, more mature you are.
8.0	When other people who do not care about news discuss some events, you will make people sit up and take notice.
8.0	World events seems easy, but it content much work,history, ecnomics, sicence or architecture and so on.
8.0	There are no fault for know more.
8.0	For example.
8.0	Recently, China and America start trade war, it had influence for each country, but most of teenager in high school do not care about any event in this world, even it's significant.
8.0	Unfrotunately, during the history exam, school made a broune question at the last-How does the trade war influence our country, then much of students can not anwser it, but some students which like watch news get a great mark.
1.0	In conclusion, no one can live without others, people need to care about the world.
1.0	Caring can make you full of knowledge, you sew a lot, then can have further sight than the people who do not know how world it is.
3.0	As a generally concened,many children are likely to make mistakes thus many people claim that parents have the responsibility to prevent their children from producing the wrong actions.
11.0	However, I hold a absolutely different view.
11.0	In my opinion,I believe that parents should allow their children to make mistakes,so the children can learn from their own mistakes.
5.0	First of all,many children are ignorant.
8.0	Children do not know which of their actions are right.
8.0	Let them do the wrong things is much better than tell them which things they could and which they could not.
8.0	For instance,a 4 year-old child do not konw the danger of a knief,so she hurts herself when she is playing whit it.
8.0	As a reasult,she is more likely to think that the knief is very dangerous than those children who are told by parents,because she realy feels painful.
5.0	In addition,children need to enperience more events in order to make them more knowlodgeable,so they have a higher incidence to create a plenty of mistakes.
7.0	After these wrong actions,they can acculate more and more useful enperiences,and that
12.0	Friends are those who can help when you are in trouble and who you can share sadness and happyness with.
12.0	When being aksed about the question whether people need the ability to maintian friendships within few people or the cability of making new friend easily.
12.0	However, the ability I treasure most is maintaining long-lasting friendship.
5.0	Initially, keeping a close friend around need to get through the test of time so it will demand not only people's communication skills but also people's ability to cope with problems between friends.
8.0	Fresh affection can always be exciting, but it won't last long when certain problems show up and people can't solve them in time.
8.0	Thus, it cost conflict between two friends.
8.0	For example, I met one of my friends ten years ago when we both went to a basketball court to play basketball in summer holiday.
8.0	It is easy for two people to be friends when the share the same hobby.
8.0	When the semaster began, what surprised me most is that we two became classmates.
8.0	And, of couse, we choose to be roommates.
8.0	That was when I realized it is not easy to keet friendship just by cmmunicating.
8.0	He liked stay late at night playing comuputer games but I was sencitive to the noise and could't fall asleep when he was playing games.
5.0	So we finally went to quarrel.
8.0	But we both want to keep this friendship.
8.0	So we had aserious talk to get things right.
8.0	We both need to made some changes.
8.0	He turned the sound of the game down and I used ear pluds.
3.0	Nowadys, parents offer thier school age children money when they achieve high grade in school.
12.0	i think this is a good idea.
9.0	firstly, if you get a high score in exam,you will get money.
9.0	this can encourage children to get a higher and higher score,it can make their life better.
11.0	Some people believe that leadership comes naturally and one cannot learn to be a leader.
11.0	As far as I am concerned, leadership is like everything else that can be learned through appropriate methods and hard work.
4.0	Firstly, there have been many scientific researches about leaderships.
8.0	Just like other things on this planet, leadership is being studies by various institutions and results are published on all kinds of scientific papers and journals.
8.0	Many organisations have been using those results to train their employees.
8.0	Even many governments adopt those method to improve staff's quality.
4.0	Secondly, many people have tried to be leader by learning and succeeded.
8.0	Taking myself as an example, I used to be shy and conversative.
8.0	I was unable to talk in front of people or gave out assignment even when I was asked to lead a project.
8.0	As a result, my team was always the worst one in the company.
8.0	In order to change this situation, I googled some papers from Internet to improve my ledership.
8.0	Following the steps from those scientific studies, I now can fluently talk in front paper and manage staff much more effectively.
4.0	However, many people still hold the thought that leadership is one's nature and cannot be learned because they could find any concrete example.
8.0	Admittedly, leadership is relatively a vague idea comparing to studies like math, chemistry and so forth.
8.0	It is something cannot see or tough.
8.0	It is something people can only feel.
8.0	And studies about it just started a few decades ago.
8.0	Although there are a wide range studies about it, there is few reports about it for most of the results are still immature and imcomplete.
8.0	But this could refutes the fact that scientists have already made huge progress in this field.
0.0	In summary, leadership can be learned.
0.0	For one reason, althgouh the studies in this field haven't been able prove conclusive result, various studies has been conducted.
0.0	For another, I, myself, benefited a lot by puting effort in studying leadership.
3.0	Nowadays, people are exposed to more pressure than ever before.
3.0	Therefore, it is of significance for people to properly arrange the time of work and have time to have a rest.
3.0	Given the choice between a three-days work with long hours and a five-days work with short hours.
12.0	I would definitely choose the latter one without any hesitation since a short period with heavy workload will destroy the schedule and do harm to our physical conditions.
6.0	To begin with, working for a long time will excert a bad influence on our health.
8.0	Physically speaking, after a long period of keeping seating, the level of blood pressure will raise up and it can't provide enough oxygen to support our brains' work.
8.0	It will make us uncomfortable.
8.0	We can't concentrate on diong the job.
8.0	Mentally speaking,we may feel exhuasted and tired about the assignments.
8.0	If we don't take some measures like looking the scenery through the windows or standing up to take a walk, our efficiency on task will dramatically decreace.
8.0	And we will not finish the work before the deadline.
8.0	Therefore, I prefer to a five-days job for short hours.
2.0	In addition, working three days a week for a long hours will detroy the arrange plan.
3.0	diversified types of tasksWith the society advancing into the information age, more various means of tasks and jobs are available for workers to choose.
3.0	Conflicts will arise whenever workers' tasks decisions are to be made regarding the single or diversified.
3.0	Both of them are closely interrelated with the satisfaction of workers.
3.0	Some people attach greater significance to working different types of tasks than working the similar tasks all day long, while others hold the opposite attitude.
12.0	As far as I am concerned, I support the notion that working different types of tasks is far better than working similar tasks all day long.
5.0	Above all, the interest is of essential importance to workers' satisfaction.
8.0	"In the face of diversified types of tasks, many wonders will occur in the workers mind, such as ""what is it"", "" how can I accomplish it"" and so on."
8.0	Undeniebly, through doing diversified types of tasks, interest is obtained.
8.0	As a recent research conducted by the State Labor Bureau indicates that over 80 percent will be bored and tired if they are dealing with the same or similar tasks for 3 hours.
8.0	Needless to say, under the circumstance of 8-hour day's working system, most of workers can't pay attention on the task in the left 5 hours, which means a waste of time for both workers and tasks.
5.0	Moreover, payment is not only needed by workers, but also the improvement of oneself's ability.
8.0	One will grow up more quickly and develop comprehensive abilities through doing diversified types of tasks.
8.0	In the beginning of one's career, it is impretive for him or her to be a comprehensive worker, thus, more payment and opportunies will obtained in the future.
8.0	We may cite my friend Jim's story, who is only 25 years old but has over 40,000 yuan salary per month.
8.0	Once I asked him why he owns both the employer's admire and high salary, he told me that he had accomplished diversified types of tasks before, which determines he can be qualified to the job now.
8.0	Indeed, the younger the workers are, the diversified types of tasks experience they need.
7.0	Judging from the above-mentioned argument, we may naturally arrive at the conclusion that workers are desire to work
8.0	I disagree with the statement that the opinions of celebrities are more important to younger than older.
8.0	First of all, for the reason that some celebrities from athletes could have same layer of influention for young and old.
8.0	As we know, in the past 2016 Olmpics, chinese free-style swimmerYang Sun gained three gold medals.
8.0	After he won, he said that sports should be universal for everyone.
8.0	Because during the Olmpics, almost all of Chinese were concentrate on watching the competition of diversities of sports program.
8.0	Thus this celebrities were spread rapidly.
8.0	Followed this celebrities was that many Chinese stared to taking  part in sports exercise.
8.0	Those group of people were composed of both teenagers, undergraduates, young worker and retired person, almost include all ages!
8.0	It is difficult to say that the celebrities from athletes was more impotant for a particular crown.
6.0	For second reason is that celebrities from the famous entertainers might  more important to older people than to younger people.
9.0	This is because the younger people who like entertainers now are not know which one is they really like.
9.0	For example, my sister Han, she alters the favorite star per two weeks.
7.0	But compare with the older people, they always have a constantly favorite stars
3.0	With the rapid development of education, people nowadays tend to use money as a propellant to encourage their school-age children for receiving a high grade in school.
3.0	An interesting discussion has arisen among people: whether it is a good idea for parent to use the money reward to their children for study achievement.
11.0	From my perspective, I am in favor of the idea.
12.0	Here are my main reasons for holding this opinion.
4.0	First of all, it provides a excellent opportunity for students to get a sense of accomplishment.
8.0	Every time when they get reward from their parents, they build confidence to accept more challenges, which is conducive to receiving a sound mentality and positive attitude toward study.
8.0	Takes myself as an example, I used to acquire reward from my parents because of the good grade in school.
8.0	I felt a sense of achievement about it and willing to put more effort on the study.
8.0	Usually, I used the reward money to buy some favourite fiction books or fashion magzines.
8.0	I was satisfied with the outcome I once pursued and have more courage for the future.
4.0	In addition, reward money help enhance the family bond, which deliminates the generation gap between the children and their parents.
8.0	Because parents give the money as a praise for the school study.
8.0	It creates a common topic for them that can bring them closer.
8.0	Such as how to study so well?
8.0	How to spend the money they owned?
8.0	Children will know what expectation their parents pose on them and parents would understand how their children study in the school.
8.0	To some extent, the excellent family bond is the premise of a bright future for children, resembles the concrete foundation of architecture.
4.0	Admittedly, this manner might have some negative effect on children, which misleads them to regrad the salary and praise as the essence of study, not the real love to aborb knowledge.
10.0	However, it is a efficient way to encourage students to be keen on study and establish their confidence about themselves.
1.0	To sum up, I believe it is a good idea for parents to encourage their school-age children by using reward money.
1.0	Not only because it helps them get a sense of achievement but also because it improve the family relationshi
3.0	Now, as the development of society, the living level of people become better and better, so more and more people would invest money on traveling, some prefers to go abroad to travel, and some people lilke traveling in their country.
11.0	I think people can get more benefit from traveling abroad instead of traveling in their country.
4.0	First, the modern technology will let the distance of people become closer, so if we want to follow the pace of the development of world, traveling abroad is the best choice.
8.0	For example, some children that born in a rich family, they will own many choices to travel, and their parents usually would them go abroad.
8.0	But other children that live in a poor family, they seldom do not travel, even travel in their country.
8.0	If we compare with the two different group children, we can find the children that have been go abroad, they are more confidient,  they can use different standpoints to analyse a question, and they can adapt different environment well.
8.0	But anothe child is worse than them in these aspects.
4.0	Second, we can practice our social abilities through traveling to foreign countries.
9.0	Because in the process that we are traveling, we will meet people from different countries and cultures, and human get ued to living together,so we have got to communicate with them.
9.0	When we talk with them, we can obtain the konwleges that we have never seen from these foreign people, and we can use this konwlege to know about more different people, so we can improve our social abilities in this way.
4.0	Finally, it is benifit for us to learn the foreign languages and exercise our thinking abilities.
8.0	For example, more and more people are studing English now, so if we want to master this language in a short time, traveling to another country is the best choice.
8.0	Because when we stay in a foreign country, we have got to communicate with them, because we need to satisfactory the basic necessarly.
8.0	So we can use the knowledge that we have masted to talk with them, in this process, we can review these knowledges and learn some local expressions.
8.0	We even can make some foreign friends, and they will have important influence on our study.
2.0	In summary, because we can improve our social abilities and adapt the world well and exercise our language abilities, I think going abroad is better than travel in
3.0	At presesnt,the people that you can have fun with may just want to get some profit from you.
3.0	Also, they may did not value the friendship between you and him or her when you meet some difficulties.
12.0	Besides, the friends who we can get help from is people that knows us better since they undrstand our weakness and willing to offer us a hand.
12.0	So, the friends you can ask for help are undoubtedly better than the friends who we just have fum with.
5.0	First, people have fun with you always have some other purposes then the frienship is mixed with some other things.
8.0	They cannot be called good friends.
8.0	The point can be best illustrated by the instance of my uncle, a bussinessman.
8.0	He always participated in some parties and he could always had fun with many people during the party and they surely had a great time.
8.0	But after the parties, my uncle paid little attenion to the connection with these people.
8.0	Instead, he would call or e-mail the friends who borrowed him money when he failed in business more.
8.0	I once asked him why, and he told me that during the parties, people all had their own purposes, they may just want to have some cooperatiion with you on business to earn more money.
8.0	So they would not treasure the frienship as much as the people who are willing to help you since they think you are a good friends.
8.0	And this kind of people would value the friendship most.
8.0	These friends is people that is worth of you to get to know.
5.0	Second, it is very likely that people who can play with you just isolate you when you have threats or difficulties.
8.0	"Just as an old saying, '' A friend in need is a friend indeed""."
8.0	For instance, I have had a friend who can play with me whenever he had time.
8.0	And we always had fun with each other, so at that time I thought he was the person who knew me most in the world.
8.0	But after my death of my grandfather which led to my psychological disease, he almost never talked to me since he was scared of my affecting him.
8.0	But some other classmates who I did not always play with came to encourage to go through th difficulties and fece the problems.
8.0	Thanks to their encouragement, not very long, I became the optimistic boy again.
8.0	And untill then I surely realized that they were the people who I should treasure and play with, they are willing to help with me and they are surely the friends I need because when I have trouble they would help me, when I face trouble they would face it with me.
11.0	I really agree with the statement that in twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.
12.0	In todays society, more people pay attention on the environmental issues.
11.0	Thus, people will choose more environmental friendly way to go out.
12.0	And the use of cars will decreased obviously.
5.0	Because the cars will discharge a lot of harmful gas,  people will go out by some public transportations like bus, subway and bike.
8.0	With the time went by, the environment become worse and worse.
8.0	The most influence effect is the gas produced by cars.
8.0	So, the government will appeal people to use other transportations.
8.0	Also, people, themselves, will also try to build a comfortable environment by changing the transportation.
8.0	For example, nowadays, the bikes are more useful than asking for taxi.
8.0	Because,  if we use the phone to unlock the bikes, we can use the bikes quickly.
8.0	And  the cars are almost everywhere, so it is easy for us to find one.
8.0	In addition, using the bikes are cheaper and convenient.
8.0	We can park the bikes in the place that close to our destinations.
8.0	And everyone can afford the expense of using cars.
8.0	However, if we driving the cars or asking for taxi, we need to use more money and also slower than the bikes.
8.0	Considering the adventage of the other transportaion, people will wisely give up the cars and turn to other vehicles.
5.0	Also, the cars are really slow because we may always face some traffic jams.
8.0	However, the traffic jams can not be avoided because some accident factors such as the road accident.
8.0	We can never measure wehther we will be late or how we need to wait.
8.0	Also, in some large cities like Wuhan, There numbers of cars are too big that we may meet some traffic jams.
8.0	And what we can do is still waiting and waiting.
8.0	Adversely, If we use the subways, we can estimate the time exactly.
8.0	So why not people choose the other transportaion?
8.0	Of course, they will less use the cars in the future.
2.0	In my opinion, using cars have many disadvantages, which totally more than its advantages.
7.0	So, in twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today
12.0	In morden society,many parents will encourage they children by pay their children money when the children get a good grade,they claim that improve children's interest in study,so they can pay less attention later.
11.0	However,I disagree with that opinion.
6.0	Although it is a good way to encourage way,the huge drawbeak with they habevior can never being ignored.
8.0	The ambious of children is out of imagation.
8.0	It may change their value with grade and money.
8.0	That is not exception with many children cheat in test for an better grade.
8.0	They are too young to shaped they value.
8.0	For example,when I was an middle school student,I know many of my classmate had cheat in test.
8.0	At frist, it just happen at the large test,but after some teachers doubt about the truly of their grade,afriad of punish,they cheat in every test for not being detected.
8.0	Money will change a honest people to a lier.
8.0	That is a really bad influence on children's life.
10.0	Besides,it is also
3.0	Rencently, a controversial topic has a heated debate among people:whether movie and television have more negative effects than positive effects on the way young people behave.
3.0	opinions vary from person to person.
11.0	some people claims that movie and televison have more negative effects than positive effects on the way young people behave.
11.0	However, I would stand on their opposite side and I believe movie and television have more positive effects than positive effects on the way young people behave.
11.0	I have some reason to explain.
5.0	First of all, movies and television have more positive effects than negative effects on the way young people behave because these things help young people study more knowlege and how to use it.
8.0	People can understand kind of things in the television, such ad creature, education, political and other useful knowledge.
8.0	these can help young people adopt the society and acquire some new abilitys to understant it.
8.0	For example.
8.0	my friend David like watching TV, he usually watch tv in his relax time.
8.0	He very like watch science and creature in television, it helps he accumulate numerous knowledge about how to use nature power.
8.0	in two weeks ago, David went to trip with his parents together, he used his knowlege to solve all of the problem.
8.0	According this trip, his parents believe that their son can perpare himself and allow David go to a long distance study by himself.
5.0	In addition, movies and television have more positive effects than negative effects on the way young people behave because every program in television receive the protect way to realize they do not have negative element.
8.0	young people cannot find every negative events or things in television.
8.0	Parents also can choose some good program for their child.
8.0	It is benefit for young people.
8.0	For instance, a young student like imitate other people's behavior, then his parents take this child watch Tv together.
8.0	They always look some educate programs.
8.0	When this child go to the primary school, he can make some polite things and teathers and other parents believe he is a great student.
7.0	In conclusion, I believe that movies and television have more positive effects thann
3.0	Whether to give a child awarding money for their satisfing grade of an exam can be a controversial topic among parents.
3.0	While different people will have different opinions about this , as far as i am concerned, to give monry as an award for children just because the high grade seems not reasonable as the children usually have no abilities of money management.
11.0	Also, teenagers may be upset about not reach their parents expectations when there is no award.
11.0	These may lead the children to be cheat in the exam just in order to get the money.
4.0	First, children usually are in their formative years and it is possible for them to spend money randomly.
10.0	If parents provide such award for these kids, they may use the money to buy the game online or be addicted to bad habits, Since children could not distinguish what is really conducive to them in many situation, it is not a good idea to give them monry just because they get a high mark.
4.0	To take one of my classmate as an example.
8.0	When she was in the first year of the junior school, she was the monitor in the class and completed all the assignments without difficulties.
8.0	However things has changed when her parents awarded her sufficient pocket money.
8.0	She used the money to buy a mobile phone and became addicted to it.
8.0	As a consequence of this, she failed the exam eventually.
8.0	Had she not have the money for these kind of recreation, she would have never ruined her future in academic field.
4.0	Second, it is a responsibility for school kids to devoted themselves in studing rather than a mission from parents.
8.0	But with a money award, the study process seems to become a duty of their parents.
8.0	When the children are eager to get the money, they may turn to other solutions to meet their parents expectations.
8.0	This may lead to the misbehavior of their children, such as cheating in the exam just to finish the assignment of being a good student.
8.0	Under no circumanstance should we pass this kond of notions to the kids.
4.0	Although , a money reward can be a motivation for teenagers to dedicate themselve in study, obviously, in fact the disadvantages overweigh the benefit.
10.0	When a child focus more on the result rather than the process of the study, he will not achieve  the academic goal virtually.
1.0	In conclusion, to give kid monry as an award for their grades is not a good choice.
1.0	Children not konw how to use their monry in a beneficial way and this kind of awarding methor can lead to their misbehavior as well.
12.0	Judging from my daily life and things i had heared , i disagree with people are more willing to help the struggling strangers.
8.0	Some years ago,a judgement in Nanjing made all of the society focuse on the problem that should we help struggling strangers.
8.0	An undergraduate name PengYu was sentenced to failed in the judge.
8.0	PengYu said that he saw a old people was hitted by car and be left on the street alone,he helped her because of his mercy.
8.0	But the age submits that the people who made her injured wa PengYu.
8.0	Finally,PengYu was punished by law because of the judgement.
8.0	Many people think the judgement is unbelieveable.
8.0	Since this event,many people become dared to help others because the risk that might be judged to be a criminal.
8.0	In the next years ,more things like PengYu were reported made the thought stronger.
8.0	Nowadays,whatever on the internet ,my friends and familiers,most of them would be hesitated if a stranger need help but they do not have something to prove and protect thereselves.
3.0	Nowadays, the pressure of attending good school and get high grades in school extrance test become intenser now.
3.0	Parents also look forward that their children will win in this competition, so some stratagies were created by them.
3.0	For example, giving prize.
3.0	The mojarity hold the opinion that giving money is an effective way to courage students.
12.0	I, however, will show my apperication to the standpoint that offering money is not a good way, sometimes can lead to worse result.
5.0	It is well-penetrating to conclude that children cannot depend on the money forever.
8.0	They have to realize that it is their own duty to get good grades.
8.0	Furthermore, their parents could not company them when they starting collage life.
8.0	My neighbor always showing off her awards from her parents when she got good grades in front of me, years ago.
8.0	While she go to collage, her parents did not go with her, for sure.
8.0	As a result, no more prizes, and the mission she faced, is not only tests or exams, but papers and essays.
8.0	The no-longer-prize made her become procrastination to her work.
8.0	Owing to her parents' prize, she depends on it too much that she did not realized the intention of study in school.
5.0	It is well-insightful to envision that students may become greedy to the money and want more.
8.0	Still that neighbor, when she entered collage and met fresh things and realized that the money her parents gave, is not enough to satisficied her desire.
8.0	She found a part-time job to earn money instead of study, and these took her study time.
8.0	At last, she failed one course and have to pay a huge amount of money to reread the course.
8.0	This fee costs all her money earned, and she has to call her parents for more money to consume.
8.0	The parents may doubt: Our daughter get good grades in high school and middle school, what happened to her in collage...
1.0	Addmittedly, offering prize is a way to encourage students, under the case of students will not be addicted to more prize.
1.0	Only the parents and students regard the prize properly, the two sides could cooperate well and here comes the result.
11.0	I disagree this statement.
11.0	Many one think about that young people have no influence on the important decisions that determine the future of society as a whole,because young people just become the world, they are to young to cann't inluence the world.
5.0	But everyone will be old and every will  be growing up.
9.0	Many years later, the young people will be become the full of experence human.
9.0	They will be inluence the society easily.
5.0	When  EnLai Zhou is a teenage, he said that I reading for rise China.
8.0	Many years passed,he bcame a successful human and changed all of the China and every Chinese.
8.0	It was a desion when his young,so he can influence the country in the future.
8.0	ShuRen Zhou is a famous writer in China.
8.0	When he was a university students ,he want to save the soal from evey Chinese.
8.0	So he have wroten a number of books and reading that he want to Chinese can weak up.
8.0	And he successfully wo inluence the Chineses' future and sve the society.
8.0	May be young people have not enough froce and power to in influence influence on the important decisions that determine the future of society as a whole,but if they have a point and still fight to realize that ,the young human also can be determing the society's future as a whole.
2.0	So I disagree this statement.
3.0	In the first place ,it is,I think ,a good idea at the beignning,but not practical in the long term.
11.0	At first,these parents want their children to study hard.
12.0	As a result ,when their children get a high grade,they in return give them money as prize.
9.0	Because they think this will fuel children's passion for study and keep them running unstoppedly.
9.0	The good circle produces as well.
12.0	This is the beginning.
6.0	However,if always like this ,things are going to be against these parents.
8.0	Children may try to get high marks only in order to get high pay,which may develop the wrong connection between study and money in their mindset.
8.0	We need to know that study is not all for money.
8.0	We refer it as a way to improve and better ourselves.
8.0	So we can't let children slowly become what we don't want them become.
8.0	Take my brother for instance,he was a wonderful student when he was at middle school.
8.0	Since his parents did such things ,he use the money to buy fashion clothes,expensive shoes.
8.0	Although he tried to keep his high grade,he could't.
10.0	So,i
3.0	Look around us, the shortsighted young people are more and more because they spend much time watching TV.
3.0	And children are seprated from each otehr since all their attention are caught by movies and televisions.
11.0	The worst of all, we are losing the most important way to get knowledge, reading books.
9.0	Each one above, is one of negative effects which movies and tevevision bring to us.
9.0	So, undoubyedly, we are being influnced by them.
5.0	First, movie and television have great harm to our eyes.
8.0	When you waking on the street, you will see nine persons wearing glasses when ten persons have passed.
8.0	Accoring to an author investigation, we can tell thatthe porpotion of the shortsighted is almost ninety percent, which freaks us out.
8.0	One day, young prople are all wearing glasses when they go to work, go to school, and the degree is becoming higher which makes their nose informal and brings incovinienceto their life.
8.0	Whenever they need to take the glasses to appreciate the beauty of our world when they are travelling somewhere.
8.0	They have no chance.
8.0	How pity is it.
5.0	Secondly, young people are seprated by movies and television since all they want to do is to watch TV instead of having fun with their frineds after school.
8.0	In that case, the bind between them and their friends is impossible to build.
8.0	Some magzines are interviewing some young people who watch movies and Tv often.
8.0	Among their answers, the most common one is that I'm so lonely and I have no friends to play with when I want to play some outdoor games since they are watching TV when I invited them and I'm also watching movies when they come to me.
8.0	Such a boring childhood.
8.0	When we are children, the most happy thing si that we can go out to play some strange games and run after each other with friends.
8.0	Such an intersting childhood.
0.0	Last, some people may argue that watching television and movies is actually a good way to get knowledge.
0.0	But isn't reading books is truly great way to learn.
0.0	By comparing these children, you will find that the cildren who read more is more knowledgeable.
10.0	The inventor of TV seldom watched TV because he just watch news and never watched movies on TV sicne books were more like a teacher who can provide us with endless knowledge.
7.0	When two children are listening to music, the child who watch TV more just think the song is godd, but the child reading
3.0	During these days,parents always offer their children with some money after they get a high mark in a school.
11.0	however,I don't think that it is a wise choice.
11.0	Sometimes it don't needs money to make a child to study.
5.0	First,everytime the child get some money after a high grade can destroy his propose of study.
8.0	Of course it has many benificials,the child can gain more power for the study after they do a good job.
8.0	Also,they can learn to manage their money.
8.0	The pocketmoney can give them a good relax after a hardtime of study.
8.0	But,this can do bad things.
8.0	children may start learning for the money instead of themselves.
8.0	Only one time,the parents forgot to give their son some money after a good mark,this child may lost his interest on learning.
8.0	That is really bad because it is important to let a student know why he should study,who he is learning for.
5.0	Second,the children can't have a good self-management,which means that they are likely to spend their money on something may draw their attention from the books.
8.0	One of my brothers,for example,put all his pocket money into an online game.
8.0	His mother told us that this is his money,he can do whatever he likes.
8.0	The result,however, is not something she likes.
8.0	My brother play this game everyday.
8.0	While he was having fun on the class,the teacher took away his phone,and asked his parents to come to school.
8.0	He used to be the top10 in his grade,this time,he didn't pass the exam.
8.0	So,it is not a wise choice to give a child to much money.
12.0	Nowadays, due to the rapid development of society, the issue of whether students should be forced to take history course has increasingly become a controversial topic.
11.0	Some believe that they should learn it, while others disagree.
11.0	Although I have some doubts, I tend to agree with the latter, and I will articulate my view below.
4.0	Firstly, the history course will not play a significant role in some students' future work.
8.0	For those students whose major is technology, they will never use history knowledge in their future.
8.0	So, it is useless for them to take history course.
8.0	For example, my brother, who works in a computer company, always stays with computer.
8.0	The all things he should do are to invent new softwares to provide better survice for customers.
8.0	Therefore, he will not use history knowledge to invent a software.
4.0	Besides, there are some people who have less interests in history.
8.0	For everything, there are someone who dislike it.
8.0	And it is very bored for them to study history, especially forcing them.
8.0	Therefore, they will acquire knowledge about history with a low efficiency, if being forced, which means they waste lots of their time on the useless things.
8.0	And it also will have a negtive influence on their gradulation, which could have been avoided.
4.0	Although learning history course seems good for students' development, it is uesless for the people above to learn it.
8.0	They can use these time to do other things they like, such as exersice and art.
8.0	These can also improve themselves.
8.0	For example, once I hated to learn mathematics, so I used the time to learn other things like sports.
8.0	Finally, I entered a sport school with the first scores.
10.0	As a whole, I am firml
3.0	Nowadays,people put too much empheasis on education because they think it is necessary to study hard ,which is vital to the success in the future job.
11.0	However,when it comes to the statement that people with ability to relate well to others is more important than studying hard in school,I strongly agree.
11.0	There are three reasons why I feel this way.
4.0	Admittedly,education is playing an increasing role in society ,which promote people to study hard in school and it is universally accepted that people with excellent records can succeed more easily than those with poor scores.
10.0	The good records means you have a large range of knowledge and a wide base of skills and the employers are more likely to appreciate those who study hard to recieve good scores.
4.0	However,hard work is not the only standard for peolpe to appraise a person.
8.0	In fact ,the excellent social skills are more essential to the success in future.
8.0	Because people with good social skills are able to cooperate with others very well,cooperation is also an important factor for people to succeed.
8.0	It is hard for people to survive without cooperating with others,that is the reason why there are so mant small busniess belong to the large corporation.
8.0	Because if they do not work with others,their besniess might plunge in the competitive society.
4.0	Finally,the society is becoming complex and there is a strong awareness that social skills are indispensable to success.
10.0	Therefore more people are paying attention to develop their interpersonal skills and I believe that it will be continued in the future.
1.0	To sum up,it is more essential for people to develop the social skills instead of paying much attention to study.
1.0	For these reasons,social skills can make people cooperate with others more easily and the realization of the importance of interpersonal skills.
3.0	Recently, an interesting question has aroused a heated debate among people: it is better for classmates to communicate their project in person that through emails.
3.0	Answer vary from peron to person.
3.0	Some claim that send email is the good way for classmates to communicate with each other.
11.0	However, I stand on the opposite site and I firmly believe that it is better for colleagues to communicate in person in order to do a project.
12.0	Some reasons and examples given below can illstrate my point of view.
5.0	First, communicate the project by facing each other is more convinient.
8.0	As we all know, the group project is a big work for every groupmate by finding information, making schedule and building the structure, which means everyone have their own role in the team and they need good cooperation.
8.0	So facing each other in one suitable timing is more convinient for them to communicate and assign the tasks.
8.0	On the contrary, sending emails waste the time and mess the task if the group numbers are not open their email in time.
8.0	For example, my history proffessor give the project for our group to let us write a paper about the ancient greek.
8.0	We picked a suiteble timing after the history class and gathered to discusse how to write the paper.
8.0	Just thirty minutes we assigned the task and sured the roles of everyone in this takes.
8.0	Finally we just using one week to finish this paper and make it great.
5.0	Second, communicate the project by facing each other is more effecient.
8.0	By facing each other, we can give the timely idea quickly and enspire more creative idea，so the project would be finished better in content and time.
8.0	On the other hand, if you have some new idea about the project but you forget to send the emails to tell others, the project is hard to finish.
8.0	For example, my brother's math homework is to communicate with their classmates about the variey of equition in emails.
8.0	My brother fond some information about different equition but he forget to send all the massage to every classmates, so that some people miss the information.
8.0	My brother got C in this homework.
2.0	To put it in the nutshell, communicate with classmates by facing eachother is better that not only becaus it is more convinient but also because it is more effecient.
3.0	Education has always become a highly talkable issue that public are concerning about.
11.0	Not because they are attracted by the major, they are concentrated on the education that their descendants will have.
11.0	I hold the belief that universities shouldn't spend more money on salaries for university professors to improve the education quality.
4.0	First and the foremost, the quality of education almost rely on the technical machines in the classroom.
8.0	Take my university for example, our school don't have projector.
8.0	We have to gather together to watch the powerpoint on the teacher's computer.
8.0	There are nearly thirty students that I can not see the screen clearly, expecially I'm a nearsighted and short girl in my class.
8.0	I think this is the most improtant thing that influence the quality of education.
4.0	Secondly, the criterion of the education are not only depends on the professors but also students.
8.0	People who can work in the university  are capable to teach students.
8.0	But not all the students are have ability to realize the knowledge in the university.
8.0	Without fully understanding the lessons, students can't display a good command of the project.
8.0	This will encounter the result that the students of this university aren't very excellent, expecially compared to the other peers when they are in companies.
4.0	What's more is, there is no denying that more money can lure professors to focus more on thier students.
9.0	But more money can't always transfor a lazy person into a hard-working one.
9.0	This is the basic trite that a teacher should have to teach thier students.
2.0	Last but at least, I support that universities should allow thier profite in harware, which is one of the most significant factor when we rank for the university, and the students' quality is also an unneglested factor for university to attract top students, with these consequeces and improve tier qulity of education the university may have to pay more attention on students rather that professors.
3.0	Formost, I really disagree this statement that offer children monney for their high mark.
3.0	It's really destory children's mental helath.
11.0	It's important to cultivatate children in a right way.
12.0	There are three three aspects that I do not agree that children will concentrate much more on their school mark, beside ignore the others that also help for their health, it will cultivating a bad habbit, only get school mark for money and this action also inderectly destory children's mental health.
4.0	To biggin with,  Children will concentrate much more on their school assignment and test, unfortunately, the purpose is not for accept education, is for money.
8.0	After parents wage this educational way to hasten their studying, it also directly change their mind.
8.0	For instance, my friend who went the same primary school with me and same class, he did worse studying in school, then his parents did that way to encourage him to study.
8.0	Daysafter, he alwasy did work on school work and test, I asked him why, he said that he wanted money.
8.0	As you can see the phenomenon.
4.0	Secondly, this way will lead children cultivate a bad habbit, whcih was getting too much attention on money.
8.0	In their mind, money equal to studying.
8.0	For example, there  a lot of people who always want earn money, they only have one purpose that is money.
8.0	And they just know the money, do not understand the meanning of their work, those children did in this way just like a money machine,  not a student who like to accept education.
4.0	Finally, this encouraging way also inderectly destory children's mental helath from young age, after becoming adults, I do not want to think the result of them.
8.0	Their mind have changed by this way, it has has been ruin.
8.0	That's all resulted by this way.
8.0	These children who did in this way have changed and their offspring also will be influenced because the heritary.
8.0	After they being adult they also will teach their children in this way.
8.0	Their mental health will be illed.
7.0	In conclusion, parents offer their children money for  each high grade they get in school is not a perfect way to educate them in a good way to success, It's essential to bring them to a right way to success not give money for mark,
7.0	it schouold
3.0	Nowadays,  it is a common phenomen that some parents will offer their children some money in order to encourage kids to work hard in school.
11.0	Some people consider it a good idea for it can stimulate children to try their best to get a good grade in an effective way, while others are strongly against it as they contend that in this way, students will develop a bad habit.
11.0	From my perspective, I agree with the latter point of view and my reasons are as followed.
5.0	To begin with, I believe that using this way to encourage students to work hard may have some good impacts, however, the disadvantages overweigh the advantages.
8.0	In other words,  parents may help kids to have a better achevements in school,but they may also render them have a negative sense of moeny.
8.0	For instance, when my litter brother was in primary school, he did not perform well.
8.0	In order to change this situation, my parents decided to give him some money as the reward.
8.0	Although I did not think it a good idea, my brother indeed studied harder so as to win the money.
8.0	For a long time, I thought i made a mistake ,but later, a incident proved that I was actually right, that was when I parents stopped giving my brother money, he refused to study anymore.
8.0	From this experience, I learn that  providing kids money as a way to stumulate them to study is absolutely a wrong method.
5.0	In addition,  in my opinion, parents should teach kids the hardness of earning money rather than give children easily.
8.0	That is to say, many kids who never earn money by themselves may have a false illusion that it is extremely easy to make money,and it is parent's responsiblity to correct their mistakes and help them to develop the right sense of money.
8.0	Taking my friend Lisa as an example, when she was little, at first ,his parents would give her money when she got good grade.
8.0	As we were little girls who did not know the importance of money, she would spend it right away on candies, beverages and so on.
8.0	After her parents became aware of theri mistakes, they diceide to offer her money after she finished some housework ,so that she could feel how hard it was to earn money.
8.0	In this way, Lisa really began to become more careful and considerate in spending money.
8.0	From her story,we can safely draw a conclusion that It is better to make students understand the importance of earning money.
2.0	In the end, there is no denying that giving children money indeed can help kids to study harder, but I think as there are so many other ways to encourage students to work hard, we can resort to other ways to enable student to have a better performance in
3.0	We all need to enroll in a school in some stage of our lives, and the majority of people want to find a good job after graduation.
3.0	Without a doubt, the school will do everything they can help them.
12.0	How can school improve the learning experience of the students is a very interesting topic, but as a student, I think the best way to improve it is to hire more teachers.
12.0	And I will explant that in the following passage.
4.0	First, hiring new teachers can boost up the teaching qualities.
8.0	In some schools like mine don't have enough teachers, so one teacher may need to teach multiple class and even two or more different subject.
8.0	The teacher needs to teach a large number of pupils, so they are fewer families with their own student which will not be able to provide more cutermon help to the individuals.
8.0	And even more, the teacher needs to prepare for the class that is in different subjects.
8.0	Putting the staff in that kind of heavy workload can bring down the teaching qualities.
8.0	For my own experiences, my math teacher is teaching three different class, and he is always busy in his office, a lot of people ask him questions.
8.0	Because he has a lot of homework needs to go through, how ether didn't have times for it, or we got our results really late.
8.0	So hiring new teachers can really solve that
4.0	Second, I think it's beneficial for the student to have more teachers.
8.0	We all know different people have different personalities, and teachers have different teaching styles as well.
8.0	The student can expose and adopt a new teaching style if they have different teachers.
8.0	Luke and I are best friends since elementary, and he has a new biology teacher.
8.0	The old teacher that he has when 7th grade only likes to scribe an animal or let him look at the picture in the textbook, and he gets very boring sometimes.
8.0	But the new teacher introduces the PPT into the class, and now he thinks the biology is very interesting because he can understand the concept easier since it's more vividly.
8.0	And as a consequence, his has been getting really good grades at biology.
8.0	unlike me, I find a hard time at my university because I don't like my teachers teaching styles.
4.0	The last, unlike the past, the technology are advancing at the high pace, we develop more and more teaching equipment so the student can learn better.
8.0	The new teaching tools and all kind of facilities are important as well, it's true it can make the student more engaged at the study but I still think it is not as important as a good teacher.
8.0	In the past, we still have exceptional students, and a good teacher can turn a boring history lecture into fun classes without the nowadays technologies.
8.0	Before our school brings the technologies into the class, our music teacher play the piano to class to let us sing, and that is so fun because we see a real person play a real instrument, and we love it.
8.0	But after school pitchers computer, is no need for the teacher play the song when you can just hit the play button on the computer screen.
8.0	Therefore we are no longer find music class fun anymore.
0.0	To wrap up hiring new teacher can help students a lot, the teachers can pay more attention to individuals, and the students can adopt new teaching styles.
0.0	It will be helpful later on.
0.0	And it definitely out wight obtion more facilities.
3.0	Since the development of high technology sometimes need a group of people to work together, the public are now encouraging students to work together, in order to let them learn how to cooperate with others.
3.0	But will they actually learn well through this way?
3.0	Here then comes to our question: Do the students accually learn uch more effectively than they work alone if they are asked to work together?
11.0	I totally agree with the statement because I think students can really learn alot by working together.
5.0	Firstly, students who work in a group can learn from others more than they work alone, they can use what they have learnt to preforme better.
8.0	Since they are woking with several people with the same goal, they will have to learn to listen to others.
8.0	And during their listening, they can always get something from the student who is speaking: the moral he or she has, the way he or she speaks......
8.0	As long as they got something new, they will try to use it in their work.
8.0	Thus they can performe better than they work alone.
8.0	Then they can learn much more effectively since they learnt from others and got something new, with the same period of time of studying alone.
8.0	Raise myself for an example, I love to work in groups, because each member works differently.
8.0	During the working process, I can always discover the advantages my clssmates have and I can learn from them, and as soon as I use those things I have just learned, this will make me work more effectively in the next study task.
5.0	Secondly, students that work together can learn how to cooperate with others, this is something they can not learn if they study alone, this is also one of the most important things they have to learn.
8.0	If everyone wants to work effectively, they have to avoid conflictions between team members, which refers to cooperate.
8.0	They have to take care of others feelings and express their opinion appropriately.
8.0	In this way, they will learn that they are a group rather that a single individual, everyone has to make effort to keep the group work effectively.
8.0	I still remember that a class in my grade once had to take part in  a competition about one project, at first the students often had argues with each other and they did not work well.
8.0	Then one of them realized that they have to stick together rather than having argues.
8.0	So they tried to cooperete with each other, and at last won the first prize of the school.
0.0	Thirdly, students who work together can do with the area that each person is the best at, so they can accelerate thier working rate and finish their projects effectively.
0.0	If student A is good at organizing, student B is good at caculating, they they can make themselves do their best area so that every part of the project will be performed at the highest level and of the shortest time.
0.0	Then the whole group can work effectively, My class work this way, if we have an unknown question, each of us do the best areas we are, and share our results together.
0.0	Then we can get the best answer, and thus work effectively.
12.0	I think it is a good idea.
12.0	Offering money to children for their high grades is practical.
12.0	In a word, a man who does the good deals deserve to be awarded.
12.0	As for me, it is a useful means which can motivitate the children to continue learning so that they can keep such grade and even do better.
6.0	For many chidren or some adults, money is not just money.
8.0	In other words, few people will pay attention to the amount of the money they get.
8.0	That is to say, they focus more on the happiness that being awarded money brought to them.
8.0	So money is not just money, it is a respresentive of the award and an appreciation for their capablities.
8.0	It gives them the motivitation to go on persuing for the better grades.
8.0	For example, in the end of the last year, the CEO of a company called XiaoMi, JunLei, went to some small companies owned by XiaoMi and gave out red pockets for the workers there.
8.0	Although there was not much money in the pocket, everyone who received it was exciting.
8.0	It is not surprising.
8.0	Like what I said above, red pocket is not just red pocket here, it is an award since they were all devoted to their work.
7.0	I reckon that they must feel boring during the work which may defeat their confiden
3.0	There are many methods for governments to spend money.
3.0	Some people argues that improving internet access is the best choise while others hold the view that spending money to improve public transportation is better.
3.0	Although it is always wise to make people transport conveniently, I strongly believe in enhancing internet access becausee it can benefit more people.
12.0	Moreover, it can expand people's horizen and strengthen their bonds between each other.
5.0	Firstly, spending money to improve internet access will benefit more people.
8.0	There's mounting amount of people choose to stay at home on their spare time.
8.0	For example, many of my friends are more willing to play video games or watch movies at home.
8.0	Under this circumstance, reinforcing public transportation can't contribute to their daily routine.
8.0	However, Internet will be used by nearly all the people no matter they are indoor or outdoor.
8.0	So I hold the view that this can benefit more people.
5.0	Moreover, enhancing the internet access can broaden people's horizons and strengthen their bonds between each other.
8.0	You can communicate with your friends easily even though they are far away.
8.0	My uncle's son is studying in England, and he always chat with his son online.
8.0	So improving internet have an edge over others in communication.
8.0	On the other hand, you can view different movies on internet, which can spread your vision.
0.0	Though I acknowledge that improving transportation can make people go to different places easily, I habor the idea that this is not a practical idea.
0.0	Improving transportation is a huge project which needs plenty of money and a long time.
0.0	This means we can't benefit from it instantly, but after several years.
0.0	On the contrary, spending money on Internet is a faster choice.
3.0	As far as I am concerned, the independence of chind will make huge impact in their further study life and career.
11.0	The more children be independent , the more they have the chance and courage to dertime their future.
12.0	That why I strongly suggest that parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes independently.
5.0	Many people may argue that the children are too young to learn from their mistakes.
9.0	Yes, it is ture that there are many children who just know how to make mistakes but rarely know how to solve and learn fome it.
9.0	But what I want to stress is that just because of this situation, children need more exercise to it and if parents never give children the chance to try it, then how can you ask the children to solve the problem by themselves when they grow up and live far from parents.
5.0	Besides, once childeren made a mistake and solve it by themselves, it will give them a deeper impression and speard no effort to avoid it when it comes to the similar situation.
8.0	However , if the mistake is solved with the help of parents or others, it will leave them the impression that make mistakes is nothing to do with them and there will alwanys be someone come to help.
8.0	In the long run, it do a great harm to children's  further life.
8.0	In works, they may not dare to take the responsibility to counteract the bad influence bought by their mistakes and alwanys expect someone come to help.
0.0	Last but not least, giving children the chance to learn from their own mistakes will be useful in biliding childen's confidence in solving problems.
0.0	Once they have the ability to make mistakes and learn from it, they will gain the experience and know how to figure out.
0.0	In this way, they will be more confident about they future way to succeed.
3.0	When you face with trouble without  families' companyments,who can give you a hand?
3.0	Of course,it's the stanger.
3.0	"Just as the proverb says""Rely on your parents indoor,rely on the strangers outdoor."""
11.0	In the contemporary society,people tend to become more willing to help the people who get in troble even though they never meet before,due to the following reasons.
5.0	Firstly,people are well educated rather than the old time.
8.0	Thus,teachers and parents are able to tell them it is a valuable thing to help the people in trouble.
8.0	Just take myself as an example,my parents not only pay attention to my study,but also my manner.
8.0	And they teached me how to be a good person who is appreciated by everyone.
8.0	I can clearly remenber there was a time when I help a older go acroos the road,my mother heard it and praised me with a big meal.
8.0	Afer that  I realized help others,even if a little thing,it is valuable for me to do it.
5.0	Secondly,people can help others from varied ways.
8.0	For instance,the high-tech can react more instantly than the people.
8.0	When you find a man lying on the road but still has breath,what will you do?
8.0	Will you help him relive by yourself?
8.0	I dont' think you can do it well.
8.0	Acutally,we will use the phone to call the police or the doctor nearby.
8.0	It is more convient and efficient,isn't it?
8.0	In such rush hour,the high-tech is able to help us a lot.
8.0	So you will not be afraid of assisting for others will waste your time.
8.0	It just spend a little time to deal with it.
0.0	With the development of our society,people who can get well educated is more likely to help the people in trouble rather than the past.
0.0	Furthermore,due to the high-tech and other equipment,people are given more chance to give a hand to the stuggling stangers.
0.0	According to the reasons mentioned above,people today are willing to heip the strangers who are facing with troble.
11.0	I believe that doing physical exercise is a batter way to relax than watching videos or reading books.
11.0	Especially for a colloge student who doesn't do much sports.
5.0	As a student who doesn't  have much spare time out of major's courses like me.
8.0	I have a lot of time spending indoor.
8.0	So the few chances which i can do some sports outdoor such as running, palying soccer and swimming can always make me relax.
8.0	And i believe, my situation is simmilar to most of the teeangers in China.
8.0	Lacking outdoor activites is a very huge problem in today's Chinese educational system.
8.0	Students from primary school to university bury their haeds in books in most of their time.
8.0	And the main way to relax is palying computer, including palying computer games and watching movies or series.
8.0	So, doing physical exercise is essential for students' health.
8.0	In this matter, doing sports is a better way to relax.
5.0	In the meanwhile, we can't say reading a book or watching videos are not  good ways for relaxing.
8.0	Books are the best way for us to access knowledge and make progress.
8.0	But the point is, we chinese students spent too many time in reading book, although the main reason to do that is for testing.
8.0	So we can't make them read for relax any more.
8.0	It not only hurt their eyes and health, but also make them forget there is a much more colorful world outside the window.
1.0	As a students major in science, i strongly believe that the truth of the world hide in outdoor.
1.0	So i think, doing exercise can bring you more.
3.0	Is it a common scene to you that crazy fans tend to endeavor to defend their idols' opinions on all kinds of media like Twitter, Instagram or Weibo?
3.0	In addition, most of these crazy fans are young people.
11.0	Older people, on the contrary, are more mature than young ones.
11.0	They tend to have formed their own value systems, which means they will stick to what they believe and will be less influenced by opinions of celebrities.
10.0	In a word, I fully believe the opinions of celebrities are of greater significance to young people than old ones.
5.0	First and foremost, young people tend to be more abitious and aggresive than old ones.
8.0	Through the life of celebrities, they could envision their own future.
8.0	For instance, if parents of a boy, who is a basketball lover, asks him to work hard, he may ignore them.
8.0	But if Lebron James states on Instagram that hard work is the key to his achievements, the boy is more likely to be convinced for he believes the hard work will lead him closer to his dream life of a basketball star!
5.0	On the contrary, the older people have experienced more through their life and formed their own value systems.
8.0	For example, if a celebrity says if you work hard, you will definitely succeed sooner or later.
8.0	Young people tend to believe in this, but a older man knows there are many other keys to success other than hard work, like genius, inborn potential and opportunities.
8.0	So they are lessly influnced.
3.0	Human beings have become more independent due to the improvement of society.
3.0	Thus the topic that whether people should work at the familiar atmosphere has been held in high regard.
3.0	And some people hold the view that working near family and friends is a privilege.
3.0	However, from my perspective, high salaries is predominant.
12.0	Here are some reasons.
5.0	To begin with, people who are exposed to a totally new situation can often improve theirselves.
8.0	Because they have left their familiar atmosphere and  thus they do not have other's help like used to be, then they are able to find some hidden defects.
8.0	For example, one of my cousins once lived in a little town where almost everyone knew him well.
8.0	So he has never been shy and could communicate with everyone well.
8.0	However, when he left his hometown and moved to Shanghai, he found that he knew anyone there and he was too embarrased to talk to his colleagues.
8.0	Through this ,he realized that he had communication barriers with strangers.
8.0	But instead of annoyed, he was happy to see his disadvantage before it caused bigger trouble.
8.0	So it's obvious to see that outside work benefits people more.
8.0	Had my brother not moved to Shanghai, he would have never known his diffidence and had the chance to make change.
5.0	Second of all, high salaries means indeispensible for the modern people.
8.0	Coming along with the rapidly accelerating urbanization is the continuously increasing prices of commodities.
8.0	Therefore, citizens nowdays hvae high living cost even though our life quality has been improved thanks to the new advanced technology.
8.0	The high housing price is a sutiable instance.
8.0	Due to the increasing population in big cities like Shanghai, the number of house is not adequate, so the price is sustainably growing natually.
8.0	A middle-sized apartment in downtown costs several million CNY, which  is hopeless for most families.
8.0	Thus the high salary seems to be extremely significant.
8.0	In another word,  the young generation can not even find a place to live in big cities without finicial basis.
2.0	To sum up, it's obvious to see that job which has high salaries and is away-home is a better choice for the modern residents for the above reasons.
3.0	People today, whether western or eastern, are increasingly concerned about the relationship between the social development and the lifestyle.
3.0	When it comes the whether human would spand same time on cooking and preparing meals in twenty years as they do today, public have the different perspectives.
3.0	Eventhough many elder people might insist that cooking is essential in life and people spend same time in that in the future.
12.0	I am convinced of that human will spend less time preparing foods in twenty years for the following reasons.
6.0	First and foremost, the people in future will be more busy and have no enough time to cook.
8.0	This is primarily because more new fields has come through with the improvment of technology and more and more complex tasks will exist to be solved with the development of society.
8.0	Consequently, people have to pay more attention to their main job which will lead to the decrease in the devotion to cooking.
8.0	On the contrary, if people still spend same time in cooking as today, they will have less time to handle even more and more complex works.
8.0	For such reason, this kind of people will be eliminated.
8.0	There is no better illustration of the idea than the experience of my and my elder male cousin.
8.0	My cousin is twelve years older than me and went to Peking University.
8.0	At that time when he was in university, he had little amount of projects  to do and had more time to have fun with friends and learn extra abilities such as English and speech.
8.0	Nevertheless, I am in Wuhan University now, I have much more tasks to finish and have no extra time to enhance myself or to have a relax.
8.0	Just twelve years gone, there were more tasks for people to do, not to mention twenty years after now.
1.0	Furthermore, some technologies wolud be invented to help people handle their life such as preparing foods.
1.0	This is largely due to the fact that more and more basic tasks will be handled by AI rather than human.
8.0	Owing to more complex work waithing for human, the simplest works like cooking will be done by robots and they may finish these better than human.
8.0	In contrast, if the human still spend more time in basic tasks, there is no need for the world to develop artifical intelligence.
8.0	For instance, a research finished by Wuhan University showen that many kinds of work would disappear in human's world.
8.0	And the cooking is the most dangerous one, because the techonlogy is enough to let robot solve this problems better than human nowadays.
3.0	In recent days, more and more parents want their children to get better grades in test.
3.0	Therefore, many parents choose to give the kids money if the students got a high mark.
12.0	I think it isn't a invisiable choosen for those parents.
5.0	First and foremost, students will loose thier ultimate goal for studying.
8.0	The measure will make children think highly of  what they will get in the end rather than what they will study in the class.
8.0	Therefore, the ambition of these children will be trapped in an inccrent way.
8.0	As for a friends of mine, who always got a good job in the studying in daily basic.
8.0	However, he wanted to get money from his parents after he got a acceptable result some times.
8.0	Before long, he didn't know what he study for and didn't reach his goal at the end.
8.0	Going abbrently is the most important mistake he made.
5.0	For another, it is unfit for students who are easil to form bad habit.
8.0	Giving money to them will cultivate the wrong thoght.
8.0	Once they get money from their parents, they may to show the money off to their friends.
8.0	If the friends want to do something against the law, such as go to the internet bar, it is difficult to find by parents and make them addict to it.
7.0	Last but not the least, if parents  give money too much, the chdren who didn't found a right way of spending money will spend immedently
3.0	In 1986, the Chinese governments firstly invent a law that every Chinese teenager must receive the 9-year compulsory education, and the governments will pay the tuitions for them.
3.0	Truely as we can see, the threshold to be a student becomes lower and lower; however, I still do not agree with the statement that teenagers can be well-educated now than in the past.
11.0	In my opinion, there are three reason----some of them do not care about it and some of them do not pay attention to their teachers.
5.0	Some students do not care about their studys.
8.0	It is because study does not cost them anything except their time.
8.0	In the past, only rich man or officials can send their children to school or become students themselves because the fees may cost too much and normal families can not afford it.
8.0	It was believed that only those kinds of students would be bookish and respect their teachers, so only they could have the qualification to receive education.
8.0	The same reason can be uesd nowadays, most rural kids does not want to receive knowledges, and most of them are impolite and unbookish, so they do not care about whether they can study or not.
8.0	In this case, it is not easier for them to be well-educated.
5.0	Some students do not pay attention to their teachers in classes.
9.0	Because there are some students who do not want to learn knowledges, they may not listen carefully in classe.
9.0	For instance, one of my classmate called Jason did not want to study, but he needs to spend 9 years on the compulsory edcation and he played games on his phone every day.
7.0	If he just sat quitely in the classroom, that can be OK, but after a long time, more and more students knew that he played games
3.0	Due to the rapid development of human society, large quantities of wild animals and wilderness areas are confronted damage and pollution.
12.0	Therefore, the protection of them has acquired more attention.
9.0	Some people may insist that government dose not need to attach too much importance to this issue.
9.0	While, as far as I am concerned, government should invest more on thier protetion.
6.0	First and foremost, the wild species and wild environment are beneficial for both our physical and mental health.
8.0	Today, due to the growth of industries or other human activities, we have produced much more comtamination than before, which is pretty harmful for us.
8.0	Meanwhile there is a prevailing phenomenen that many people suffer from stress in their study or career.
8.0	Therefore, both our mental and physical health are facing many threats.
8.0	To solve the problem, maybe we can turn to the wild environment for help.
8.0	Last semester, I fell out of tpo 3 in my class in the final exam, which may me feel very frustrated.
8.0	Meanwhile, in that period of time, the serious air pollution in my city made me lose the chance to engage in the my favorite outdoor activities.
8.0	Thus, I could not find a way to alleviate my bad emotion.
8.0	Luckly, my father took me to a wild forest far from the city on a holiday.
7.0	The fresh air and fantastic landscape in that area gave me a relaxing and unforgettable experience
3.0	Parents always see their kids as the most valuable treasure the god gives them, and thus make them want to do everything for their beloved ones, including making the decisions for them.
12.0	Although some people say that as parents are getting busy, there are less chance for them to make discisions for the children, but in my opinion, since parents are more likely to participate in children's lives, they infact make more decisions for children than before.
5.0	First and foremost, parents make decisions for young people when they are facing a big and essential choice in lives.
8.0	Nowadays, as the economics speed up, parents no more have to worry about lives, so they have more time concerntrating themselves on their children,especially their education.
8.0	So when students are faced with some important choices, and there are something need to decide, the parents are more likely to direct them.
8.0	For example, when my father took college, all my grandparents did was giving him suggestions because they were busy with their work, they had to make a living to support my father to go to the college, but last year when I was faced with the same situation, my father vacated three whole days to work on the decision for me, he looked through all the websites and asked a lot of people for advices and finally decided a best universtiy for me.
5.0	In addition, parents are caring more about their childern in everyday lives.
8.0	Due to the special policies that the government gave, lots of nuclear families nowadays contain only three people,which means parents can only gave all of their time and attention to the only child.
8.0	And thus make parents care more about their childern and want to make decisions for them in every aspects of their lives.
8.0	Back in my parents' time, they both have siblings, so their parents did not have enough time to care each children, but my parents gave all their attention to me, they ask about my friends, decide what friends I should make, they make my scheduel for me when I am in summer vacations.
8.0	So it's obivious that they have enough time and energy to concentrate only on me.
2.0	Reflecting on the those experiences, you can definitly see that it's very common for the parents today to participate in the young people's lives and make descisions for them, the children become a indispensable part in parents' lives and what all the parents in the world want to do is trying their best to make decisions for their children to avoid them from making mistakes and walk in a zigzag street  for thus will lead to a successful and healthy life easily.
12.0	In this day and age a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people whether teacher should get same money as lawyer, doctor, and business leader.
11.0	Opinion vary from person to person.
11.0	Many people  claims that teacher is not a very difficult job, which should not get same money as lawyers, doctors and busniess leader.
11.0	However, contrary to these people's opinion is my perspective that teacher is very significant  for people even for a country, whihc should be paid as much as layer, doctor and business leader.
12.0	My points will be elaborated as follow.
5.0	First, teacher is a very hard work.
8.0	Because teachers not only impart knowledge to students, but also  need to care about student's mental health, which means that teachers have to spend a lot of leisure time  to communicate with them and comfort them when they meet some obstacles.
8.0	Take my math teacher,David as an example， he is not only works as our math teacher， but also works as our head teacher.
8.0	So he has to  take a lot of time  to know more about every students.
8.0	Sometimes, when few students cannot focus on studying and get bad grade, he will talk a lot with them and tell them some experience to overcome the  peoblem.
8.0	As a result, most time he go back to home very late.
5.0	What is equally worth discussing is that teacher is very significant for country developing.
8.0	Because  the ability and quality of students is depend on teachers.
8.0	Then, if the students is very excellent, our country  will be better in the future.
8.0	So teacher can affect country's developing.
8.0	Take a professor, Xu Beihong who teached art in Central Academy of fine art as an example.
8.0	He is very outstanding teacher and artist, who cultivated a lot students.
8.0	Then all these students  are very skillful and they won many international prize, which help our country build a very good reputation of art in the world.
2.0	In conclusion i am convinced that teacher should get same
12.0	People today are  more winlling to help the struggling strangers.
5.0	with the development of the economy,the contact of people grows more and more frequent .
9.0	People will have more experience and knowledge than their last generation.
9.0	So i strongly agree with the statement that people today are more willing to help the struggling strangers.
5.0	At the first palace,people nowadays have more oppotunities to help someone who need it.
8.0	For examples,today,we can learn a lot information from the internet that someone who struggleing in disease and pain,so we can guarantee our help more accuracy to the one we want .
8.0	Secondly,with the development of ecnomy,most people today have the capital to help others in less hesitate.
8.0	Thridly,people today are more well educated to help others  who are in struggle,people know that its a good character to give someone a hand when need.
7.0	Last but not the least,people today are more easily to accept others since the society today are more conainment,
11.0	Nowadays, we can see some news on media at times about people being less willing to help others than before.
11.0	Some people think that it's normal and we don't need to pay much attention.
11.0	But i  think people are indeed becoming less willing to help the struggling strangers.
5.0	The first reason is that the living pace in many cities are growing increasingly fast, which makes it more difficult for people to observe the things happened around them.
8.0	People are paying more attention to themselves so sometimes people just don't realize that some strangers are struggling and ned help.
8.0	We can see taht in many big cities like Beijing when people are on the way to work or home they hardly have attention on the people around them, instead they have to focus on their phones.
8.0	People almost don't know whether strangers need help or not!
5.0	Secondly, there have been many news happened in China that the people who helped were cheated and wrongly accused of hurting the stranger.
8.0	These news make people dare not to help any more becaus epeople don't want there kind heart being cheated.
8.0	There has been a case that an old people slid down just by accident, a young man came to help and send the old people to the hospital.
8.0	However, the old people accused the young of knocking down him.
8.0	The news came out with a reslut that many people choose to just look and don'yt wanta to help when they see some people slide down and really need help.
0.0	However, although i state that people nowadays are less willing to help strangers, it doesn't mean that there are no people willing to help.
0.0	We xan still see many stories around us that some kind people even risk their life to save strangers when they face danger or in trouble.
0.0	And we need to do something to keep the bad trend from expanding.
0.0	In order to make more people willing to help, we can slow down the life pace, we can also construct a better law system to punish those who cheated the people helped them.
3.0	In modern society, many parents are too busy with their work to have enough time to company with their kids.
3.0	So how to use the limited time to help chirdren growing up appropriately is very important.
3.0	Some people agree that parents should play with kids because this can enhance the relationship between two generation.
11.0	However, from my perspective, I contend that parents need to do more activities related to schoolwork.
5.0	Admittedly, playing with kids can provide both of them with a happy life.
8.0	Children would like to stay with the person who can bring him or her happiness.
8.0	Nevertheless, I think this entertainment is temporary because after kids growing up, they will complain about his parents are not responsible for his future life.
8.0	Being strict with kids' academic condition is good for children in long terms.
5.0	In addition, playing can be replaced by kids' friends but caring about schoolwork is only parents' duty.
8.0	As you all know, friends are the people whom you can play with freely.
8.0	Take myself as an example.
8.0	When I was in primary shcool, the time I valued most everyday is the period when I left school and did not return home.
8.0	I used to ride bike with several friends to buy the roasting food, talking about our favorate cartoon which could never share with my parents.
8.0	There is no doubt that kids can have more fun with friends than parents.
8.0	What is more, in the other hand teachers had given some assignments to parents to help us studying, which could not be done by friends.
8.0	For example, the dectation tasks or checking my homework.
8.0	"As the old saying goes, "" Parent is the second teacher of their kid""."
8.0	Parents should show their importance in kid's academic study.
2.0	In a word, it is more appropraite for parents do activities with kids'schoolwork.
12.0	Some young adults are always complaining about rules society established for them being too strict, seldom leaving space for youngersters to live a better life.
11.0	Though as far as I am concerned, rules established are reasonalble and carefully designed, and there are no way that young people should not follow them in universities, work places.
6.0	Firstly, universities put up a serious of rules to make sure that schools are under a good learning atmosphere.
8.0	As we all know that some students would rather take risks to cheat in the examinition than work hard, who would recieve severe punishment like leaving the school according to the rules.
8.0	But the strict rules are necessary.
8.0	Just to imagine a university student is caght cheating in a final examination, ending with good grades and  mild punishment.
8.0	And other students would do the same thing because compared to good grades, mild punishment is worthing a try.
8.0	According to a recent research, young people in universities with mild rules are more likely to cheat or bribe teachers in final examinations, so the rules followed by young people in universities are reasonably strict.
1.0	Secondly, sets of rules made by companies are complained too strict only by those lazy young adults who are not willing to obey.
1.0	In my case, the international company I worked at makes rules that all the workers in the trading department must learn to speaker at least two kinds of foreign languages fluently.
10.0	My friend in that departments is negative against the rules, thinking they are too hard to follow.
7.0	But the fact is that the people in trading departments would make appointments with foreigners in at least five different countries, whcih mak
3.0	It is widely acknowledged that people are willing not to help the struggling strangers.
3.0	But I do not think so.
3.0	first and foremost, struggling strangers may be more fancy than common people.
3.0	For example, if you are CEO in apple, there is a hard working student who work over 12 hours and just sleeping 5 hours and a lazy people who play games and sleeping every day.
11.0	Which one you will choose.
10.0	Of course the first one.
6.0	In addition, you will be more pitiful when you see a struggling strangers working.
9.0	For instance, When you see a struggling strangers, you maybe make your heart and let you think a lot thing in your past, perhaps these thing are happy, sad or exciting.
9.0	And this will let you want to help him.
1.0	But ever coins have two sides, this thing is not exception.
1.0	Whereas  I think the advantage of help the struggling strangers is    In short, struggling stranger will get more help than common people.
3.0	Nowdayts, many teachers are encouraging their students work together, however, some of others ask kids to study alone.
3.0	Which one do you want to choose?
3.0	Alone or together?
12.0	I think that if students work together they will learn much more effectively than work alone on  projects.
5.0	Admittedly, to study on one's own may have some merits.
9.0	Students are less likely to be distracted, for example, specially when one needs to remember something complex in a relatively short time, like preparing for a math test in one week with some formula to remember.
9.0	However, in general conditions, completing a task with someone has many advantage.
5.0	For one thing, studying in a group makes it possible for each student to accomplish a part of the task, which make the difficulties in the assignment.
10.0	Students in turn are able to finish more challenging tasks.
7.0	I remember last year my history teacher ask my study group to a
11.0	Leadership is always a quantity that most of us desire to own.
8.0	In fact, few of us gets this quantity not because it just comes naturally, but becaue we lack enough practice to clutivate it.
8.0	The chairman in the group are also learning to inspire the cohension among group member and then he or she becomes a proper leader.
8.0	Also many course in our university are training the students how to learn to be a leader.
8.0	Then, some entrepreurs also read many books to get the information about how to manage a group.
5.0	First, poeple are train themselves by doing a certain job to foster the leadership quantity.
8.0	This point can be best illustrated by the example of Jackie Ma, the CEO of Alibaba.
8.0	When he was in the university, his curricular performance was not so satisfied, so he participated in some groups and competed for the chairman.
8.0	After becoming the chairman, every time there were some tasks assigned to their groups he always figured out how to manage and lead the members to finish tasks.
8.0	During this process, he always molded his characters as a leader and fulfill his potential.
8.0	Under this pressure and motivation from the upper group, he had to be quantitive enough to elevate his own ability to lead others.
8.0	So by then we can see that this is surely work and he finally become a succeesful leader, which play an important role when he leader the staff in company.
5.0	Second, some courses in university are teaching students how to become a great leader, which are popular among students and it also work well.
8.0	For instance, our university has this kind of class and I also register it to heighten my leadership.
8.0	When I take this class, the professor will tell us something about the phycological and management expertise, which nurture our leadership since we can surely know how to get along with the staff and how to encourage them to spend all their energy to complete the tasks.
8.0	Then after the systematic trainning and teaching, it is hard to say our ability to guide others is not elevated.
1.0	Last, some books are also sources of the information about how to manage people in the group.
1.0	My uncle is a leader of several people.
7.0	And he usually recommend some magzines and books about how to raise the ability to lead others, and according to his story, these things help him a lot because there are all other people's experience and we can absord the benefit in it and know how to solve the problem about leading
11.0	Actually, information from different new resources can confuse some person, especially he doesn't gain enough knowledge to judge the information.
11.0	However, it is necessary to have it.
12.0	The reason is that information from various resources can ensure reader to know the whole thing about the issue or problem and enforce him to challenge the information and learn the experience.
5.0	To begin, if someone wants to know the whole scope of the problem, he should get more information not just one sentence or composition.
8.0	The issue must consist of different kinds of reaspn and disturb the judgment of the reader.
8.0	Therefore, he should study more and get more to have a clear view of the problem.
8.0	For instance, there is a crime about a soldier died in thee troop.
8.0	Original the leader of the troop wanted to erase the evidences and announced the cause of the event  is too long training.
8.0	Reader should know how  a mand killed but not receive the information from the leader.
8.0	Therefore news reporter started to dig out the cause and unveiled the ugly things behind the issue.
8.0	From this, we can know how important it is to get more information to figure out the problem.
5.0	In addition, people can challenge the information from varied resources.
8.0	Unfortunately, news for different resources are not always right and people should look into the information and try to select which is right and appropriate to them.
8.0	With the training, they can learn the skill gradually and apply it to different problems.
8.0	For example, there are many reasons for the seism and people all know they can receive source before it happens.
8.0	However many weird or confused expositions emerge and citizens didn't know what is correct.
8.0	Someone may said when you see many ants run on the ground, the earthquake may happen latterly.
8.0	There is no evidence to prove the phenomenon.
8.0	Therefore it will cause great fear, once person believe the expanation and guess wrongly.
8.0	From the above, people should get more information from different resources and challenge it that can avoid any inappropriate operation in the future.
1.0	Considering the above, reader should gain information from various resources.
1.0	The reason is that people can know the whole event but one factot and learn to challenge different information and know the real cause of the issue.
12.0	"I can't agree more with the statement ""Parents should let their children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes"",as the chinese old saying goes""failure is the mother of success"",our human being always get some lessons and experience from our own failure and mistakes,and then I will show some reasons and examples to support my point."
5.0	First of all,there is no wonderful man in the world,so,each of us can never avoid making some mistakes,so as the children.
8.0	The kids are too young to choose the right thing to do all the time.
8.0	However,I believe after each mistake the child make,he/she will keep it in mind and learn something.
8.0	Next time,when they meet the same situation,they know how to avoid the wrong answer.
8.0	As a result,if the parents let their children to make mistakes as more as possible,their children can get new knowledge more.
5.0	"Secondly,""Practise makes perfect"",if the children do something wrong at once,that means ,he/she has another chance to try it again."
8.0	I think the child who make mistakes can experience more than those who not.
8.0	For instance,when I was studyding in the university,maybe I am not the one who is clever and outstanding,I can't do almost everything well at once.
8.0	Sometimes,I can not pass our fundermental class,so I have to study it again with others and then take an exam again.
8.0	During that period,I was really frustrated and go to ask the teacher for advice,however,my teacher tell me that：You should be happy that you are the girl who take in thing slowly,which means you can enjoy more process than others,and you can strike these knowledge in mind forever.
8.0	After hearing what the teachers said,I bacame to realize that making miskakes can help us develop better.
10.0	In conclusio
10.0	The wisdom of relaxing
3.0	Different people has different ways to relax themselves.
3.0	In addition, the way of relaxing varies from the activities people was doing before taking a rest.
3.0	So I disagree with the idea that it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book.
10.0	Never will I think that different activities of relaxing ranks.
4.0	Let's take different types of people for example.
8.0	Some teenagers are out-going and they prefer doing sports to relax themselves while some are quiet and they often relax by watching a movie or reading a book.
8.0	For workers,they prefer a quiet way to relax themselves like reading a book.
8.0	Because they have worked all day physically and it's time to relax their bodies.
8.0	However,for the people in the government,they often run and play sports after a day's work.
8.0	Sitting in the offices for more than eight hours,it's time for them to do sports to relax themselves.
4.0	There is no spercific datas that shows whether it is much better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book.
8.0	Actually,it depends.
8.0	As the phenomenon showed above,people just take relaxs for the way they prefer.
8.0	And they can all benefit from them.
8.0	It's hard to say which one is better.
4.0	Therefore,the most significant point we should focus on is that whether they have actually relaxed themselves after taking the activties.
8.0	As far as I am concerned,the quiet way of relaxing equals to the out-going way of relaxing.
8.0	Any way,suitable relax does good to human beings.
8.0	Thus my advice on people is choose a way that is suitable to themselves.
8.0	Rather than hold on to a way painfully that they believe will benifit themselves,it is wiser to choose a way that will entertain themselves.
8.0	Only then will every one enjoy life and live longer and pleasantlier.
3.0	Nowadays, there is a prevailing trend among parents that thet offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.
3.0	It seems like a reasonable and fair method, children can learn that there is no easy money at an early age.
12.0	However, looking from other aspects, it is harmfal to the childern's personal development.
5.0	One reason is that children may develop a mindset that the purpose of getting a high mark is to gain more money, but not to consolidate the knowledge they learn.
8.0	Malbehavior may be resulted from this mindset.
8.0	For example, student will have larger motive to cheat in the exams, so that they can get award from parents.
8.0	Also, this mindset is not beneficial for their long term development.
8.0	Once entering universities, studying becomes a highly self-disciplined task.
8.0	If the student's aim is not equipping himself with knowledge, but just fulfilling the parents' wishes, he will fail to set a clear goal and get lost in the university.
5.0	Another possible result of this method is rebellious psychology towards study and even towards parents.
8.0	Each child has his or her own talent, and the talent could be dancing, singing, drawing, and not necessarily studying.
8.0	In this case, high mark at school is not an efficient measurement of their talents.
8.0	If parents only reward their childern based on grades, those who are not good at studying would get frustrated over time, thus further losing the interest in studying.
8.0	The method would play a counter-productive role.
0.0	Owing to the reasons stated above, I don't think the method is instructive and appliable.
0.0	Giving money as award is opportunistic and short-sighted.
0.0	Instead of giving material awards to their childern, parents should make effort on generating the chilren's interest in studying, and developing the real potential inside.
0.0	This is what parents need to think more about.
3.0	As we know, some parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.
11.0	They think it's a good to encourage children to get high goals.
11.0	However, in my opinion, it seems not to be a good idea.
5.0	On the one hand, even offering money can help school-age children try to gaining high grade, there is no impaction if children don't get high grade in school.
8.0	It's better to get high score to gain money while it's ok to recieve a normal or low score to get nothing.
8.0	On the other hand, wheather students don't need to struggle to requie high score if parents don't offer money to students?
8.0	As a student, we need to be responsible to our grade.
8.0	In the other words, students who are intreasted in learning are almost hardwork.
8.0	Consideing all infactors, the high grade is not the only way to envaluate a student.
8.0	Some students are hard, but they try their best to get a normal grade.
8.0	Although it's not typically high score, it's their best score.
8.0	They also need to be encouraged.
8.0	As for the students who are not intreasted in studying but in other fields, I think parents are also need to provide their agreement to their children.
5.0	The high grade in school is not the most significant thing in our life.
9.0	Such as the richest man in the woild, Bill Gates, he studied in a famous college.
9.0	However, in order to achieve his goal, he give up his study and fight in the other way.
2.0	In short, I don't think it's a good idea to offer money to their children for high score.
3.0	The source of happiness can very from person to person.
12.0	Some people enjoy their work, thus they seem wrok as their source of happiness.
11.0	However, for me, the social life plays an more important role in my happiness than my work.
12.0	My points can be elaborated as fellow.
5.0	Above all, social life will constantly change over time, so new enjoyment keep appearing.
8.0	From the first place, we can always meet new people, like new cilents from work or strangers meet in a party, and it will bring me much fun to meet a person who has common topic with me and to get along well with him.
8.0	Moreover, my old friends will also make new achievement, like marriage or getting promotion, and it will be of great fun to celebrate with them.
8.0	However, for my work, when I have completely adapoted to it, it will rarely change any more.
8.0	Even though I enjoy my work at first, it will quickly become tiring and dull over time.
5.0	Moreover, social life enables me to enjoy my work.
8.0	This is because, even though I make a achievement in my work, I need to let the other know it, otherwise it makes no sense.
8.0	Although I can also get enjoyment by overcoming difficulties in my work, it is the praise and congratulation from the others that brings me the most happiness.
8.0	On the contrast, if I complete a harsh task, while no one knows about it, I not only cannot get any comment from the others, but also don't make any contribution to the society as if the task doesn't exist.
8.0	If what I have done makes no sense, I will not feel happy about it.
7.0	For example, many scientists are proud of getting Nobel Prize, because it shows their
3.0	It is a tendency that parents pay more attention to the education of their children and they desire to try every possible measure to make their children have a good school performance.
12.0	So there has a phenomenon that some parents give much money to their school-age children.
11.0	Different people holds different views, some people think this is a bad idea, but I believe this is a good idea, and there some reason to list.
4.0	First of all, parents offer their children some money can make the kids get a good grade in the school.
8.0	Because if children are awarded some money, they can buy something that they have desired.
8.0	And that will facilitate child to more likely get a good mark.
8.0	Take my cousin as an example, my uncle, he always awards his son some money if my cousin get a good grade, so everytime my cousin always use this money to buy some joy that he like, since then, my cousin in order to gain this fund, they always to study hard and get a good performance in school.
8.0	So my uncle's behave encourage my cousin to study hard, I think this is good behave.
4.0	Another reason is that offer some money to children can cultivate kids ability to manage money.
8.0	In modern society, the ability in financial management is an important capacity for people's life.
8.0	So if children get some money, that will offer an opportunity for kids to manage their money.
8.0	For example, when I was a child, my mother always give some money as an award for me, if I can get a good scorn.
8.0	So have this money, that means I have own coffer.
8.0	Every time when my mother awards some to me, I will save this money, after passing through a long time, a little money becomes a huge sum nowadays.
4.0	Admittedly, offer a lot of money as an award to children to get a high grade maybe make some kids misunderstand the meaning of money because they might think to study is equal to get money.
9.0	But I think if parents can teach their children for a correct method, kids will can't to misunderstand the money's study's meaning.
9.0	So I think to give some money to children facilitate them get a good grade is a good idea.
1.0	All in all, offer much money to children encourage them to get a good mark is a good method.
1.0	because it can make kids to study hard also can cultivate the children's ability in financial management.
3.0	Many people say that extended family is not so important in the past as it is now.
3.0	They think that in the old days when people are not that wealthy, they did not have time or energy to care about others.
11.0	However, in my opinion, extended family is more important in the past.
5.0	Firstly, being poor in the past, people tended to bond together to support their family.
8.0	They helped each other to do agricultural work.
8.0	Working together, they were more familiar with each other and relied more on their extended family.
8.0	If something came emergently, it was easy to borrow money from extended family because people all trusted each others.
8.0	If their extended family were in trouble, they gave a hand too.
5.0	Secondly, the young were more likely to befriend thier cousins in the past.
8.0	WithoutInternet, pkids will have fewer ways to make friends.
8.0	Unwilling to stay alone, it is possible that they went to play with their cousins who lived near them and be friend with them.
8.0	In other words, they would grow up together and had impressive influence on each other.
8.0	And they are important for
2.0	In conclusion, the extended family can benefit people now, it is more important in the past.
3.0	Nowadyas, with the dramatic development of the economy and the society, people are becoming busier with their work or they may fell behind and could not sustain a substaintially ample life.
3.0	Therefore it becomes harder for parents to allocate plentiful time to accompany their children.
3.0	The approaches of spending the limited time with them vary a lot.
12.0	While some people argure that it should be used to do something related to schoolwork, I insist that parents try to play with children as much as possible.
5.0	Firstly, if all the time with parents' company is spent on things associated with assginments, homework and academic research, it may foster an impression of that nothing outweighs grades in school on children, since parents only talk about these issue to them in this conditon.
8.0	This misunderstanding could result in a passive attitude toward life.
8.0	Most children do not interest in schoolwork naturally.
8.0	Thus if the parents act as if education is all about life, children could lose their passion for life and suffer from some mental problems.
8.0	On the contrary, if parents could spend their time with children more on leisure activities, children could develop colorful values of life and world as well, since the approach of parents' allocating time suggests there are numerous things other than schoolwork.
5.0	Moreover, games and sports are extremely important part of children's life.
8.0	Actually the academic burden in school is getting heavier as the whole world is attaching much significance to education, which deprives a lot  of children's attention from games and sports.
8.0	Thus it is quite crucial for parents to guide them to value their physical as well as mental development in games and sports.
8.0	Via spending the mere time on activities that is fun and beneficial to their body and brain, it is more likely for the children to understand that keeping themselves in good health is also important as well as getting good grades in school.
0.0	Admittedly, education is integral in a child's life indeed, but it should not be attached with so much attention or focus that parents involve only in their schoolwork.
0.0	The society sending almost all of them to school has already expressed such trends to the full, so it is realy not necessary to fill their life only with stuff relevant to this.
0.0	Besides, playing games or sports could be a relaxing way of helping children to learn as well.
0.0	Thus in my opinion, if the parents only have limited time to distribute to their children, it is better to have fun with them.
11.0	I disagree with the argument that young people cannot make significant influence on the decisions of the whole society.
12.0	Though most important leadership positions are occipied by older people in China, as well as other countries, young people still play inevitable roles in the development of economy and civilization.
4.0	First, young adults take the responsibilities of many cruical posotions in society.
8.0	Young people's physical conditions are better than most old people, which indicates that many employments are more suitable for young employees than older ones.
8.0	Soilders are mostly young people, some of whom are 16 years old, and their roles in protecting the country cannot be denied.
8.0	Young people have many advantages in some fields that need better physical strength.
4.0	Second, young people are innovative and ambitious, and they can be quite competitive in many fields.
8.0	Businessmen are getting younger, more and more young faces shown up in important economic conferences annually.
8.0	New ideas mostly come from young designers, young enigneers and young researchers.
8.0	Indeed, young adults are gradually changing the society and the world by providing new thoughts and theories, which can be easily noticed if people pay attention.
4.0	Finally, old people are still in smoe more inportant positionsboth in business companies and in polotical field, and the function of experience is still considerable, we still need to believe that young people is deciding the future.
7.0	Since in about 20 years, young people will gr
11.0	I don't think it is a good idea to let school-age children gain money form their parents for their high grade (mark) in school.
8.0	The reason why their parents ues such a methed is to encourage their children to get a enthusiasim toward study.
8.0	But it can not be the reson for their study.
8.0	For children at this age, it's time for them to raise their own dream and also find what they are really interested in.
8.0	Their interst on someting is what really push them to get a better know about it, like many astronomers remind the starry sky they usually looking at in their childhood.
8.0	For those children who study for one thing just for love, if you stop giving money to them, it will not infect them at all.
8.0	But for those who learn it for money, they will give up and never pick it up again.
6.0	Somebody will says, there is scholarship in university so why we can't use it in schools?
8.0	Undergraduates are different from students in schools.
8.0	As adult, they have the ability to clear what they want and what their future should be like.
8.0	They study for want they want, not just for scholarship.
8.0	But for children, they are likely to study just for the money to buy some sweet or toys they want.
0.0	If parents just want to encourage their children to study harder, why not try to raise their interesting toward it?
0.0	Using some small toys or just play some science CDs for them are also useful.
0.0	Our goal is to raise their interest instead of just giving money to let them put themselves into knowledge.
12.0	When it comes to the issue whether parents should point out the mistakes of their children or not, different people have different have different reflections of the issue.
12.0	Some hold the idea that letting children make mistakes will induce unnecessary losses, howerever,for some reasons, i believe that there are some advantages if parents let their children make some mistakes.
6.0	First of all,children can absorb some experience from the mistake and avoid make it again.
8.0	We often have the experience that when we make mistake, we will remember the mistake for a long time and not make it again.
8.0	When i was young, my mother always look through my homeworks but did not point out my mistakes, and she just let me find out mistakes by myself.
8.0	So when i checked my homework again and again and find many mistakes finally.
8.0	In this process, I dramatically learned how to solve these mistakes, so I would never make it again.
8.0	Therefore, it is advisable to let children make mistakes and learn from it.
1.0	Futhermore, in children's life, live a smooth life without make any mistakes is bad for them.
1.0	They will unable to deal with the problems and just make it worse.
8.0	We should develop their ablity when they were young.
8.0	It is easy to develop their thinking and make a good enviorment.
8.0	Make mistakes when we were young is not bad things, because mistakes can make life more beautiful and exciting.
7.0	All in all, let children make mistakes can lighten parents' pressure and take care of their children
3.0	Nowadays, with the development of economic which was guided by the government, our condition of life become better than before, we always have more power and time to do things besides earn money.
3.0	With this surplus power and time, people spend more time and energe to pay some attention on others' lives in society.
11.0	Persons are likely to help people they don not know but tries their best to the target.
10.0	Why do we like to do this kind of things in today's society?
5.0	First and foremost, one of the primary causes is that we can gain the sense of achievement by help other become suceed.
8.0	we must feel a sense of achievement after we finished any kind of things even just a little bit small thing , how won't we be happy for giving a hand to a sucessful man's growth process.
8.0	Take a concrete instance, when I was young, I have been  lived in the house of my grandma, which was located in a small village, there was a small farm behind our house.
8.0	One day, I played in the farm and found a newly borned lamb that even cannot stand.
8.0	After asked for the owner's permission, I went to wipe it up and help it to stand.
8.0	It was just an insignificant thing, but a was fulling in the happiness for a whole week.
8.0	This kind of feeling was too wonderful to say.
5.0	What' more, we can also make more friends by this way.
8.0	In the process of helping others, we can establish and maintain a strong relationship with the one who receive our help.
8.0	This bon will exist in our whole life, sometimes you and he or she would be the best friends that no one can break up.
8.0	Relationship built in a tough environment is the strongest.
2.0	Last but not least, the struggling person is who will never forget the helpness, he will report back to the society,make our life better.
7.0	He can built a new cou
11.0	Privacy plays an important role in our daily life, but whether or not should famous entertainers and athletes deserve to have more privacy than they have now is still controversial.
12.0	Some people claim that they should have enough stronger mentally to bear the excessive outside attention, while others may believe that celebrites are supposed to have more privacy than they have now.
12.0	Personally, I prefer the latter statement since nowadays some problems of lacking privact have been already bring some disadvantage for them.
5.0	First of all, celebrities' privacy have been already be threatening by some wrong approach.
8.0	Nowadys, celerity's personal imformation always be spread by some illegal group and unsafety network, such as ID cards and telephone numbers.
8.0	And then some people will sell these information, which seriouly affect celebrities' normal life.
8.0	For example, Wang Ziyi, who is the member of Nine percent, once his telephone number was spread owing to lack privacy.
8.0	And then some people  sell the telephone number and then there have some fans to disturb him.
8.0	This behavier seriously affect his normal life.
8.0	Therefore, I believe that famous enterainers should deserve to have more privacy than they have now.
5.0	On top of that,
2.0	Judging from these evidences, we may safely arrive at the conclusion that it is necessary for famous entertainers and athletes deserve to have more privacy than they have now.
7.0	Although some people may claim that they can earn lots of money which normal people may not earn in the whole life so they should have enough strong mentally to bear the excessive attention, some behavier have already hurt them
3.0	It is difficult fora parent to just look their children making mistake.
3.0	Most parent have been get used to do everying well for their children.
11.0	However, at some point part of being a good parent is letting them do it just themselves and making mistakes.
11.0	No matter how much we want to help our kids,they need to have the freedom to make mistakes and lern from them.
6.0	Youe fails and mistakes can be greatest lessons.
8.0	Children experience what they had done wrong,they will know how to do it right next time,and they will also know how to think about the question.
8.0	What matters best is not the result but is children know how to think it .
8.0	They will learn a lesson,When i was young ,i forgot to bring my homework to school, i phoned my mom to send it to me.
8.0	To my surprised,she refused it and told me it is my own bussiness.
8.0	So from that day,i always check my schoulbag twice before i go to school,and i never fogot to bring my schoolbag anymore.
2.0	Anyone will make mistakes in their own lifes.
8.0	So we don't need be afried to making mistakes.
8.0	Based on this ,we shouldn't be afraid of our children's failure.
8.0	By this way,they will have encourage to do anything,and they will be more creative,they will more thoughts and to put it o In conclusion,if we want our own children to develop a sense of responsibility,we just need to let them do it themselves and making mistakes.
8.0	Because no one can protect their children forever,and we can lern to live our own lives by growing up through our mistakes.
3.0	I disagree with the statement.
3.0	Personally speaking, I have no preference between those options of method for relaxing.
11.0	Movies, books, and physical exercises, to me, are all great and important ways to relax.
5.0	Movies and books are soul food.
8.0	After a rough day of studying and working, a lovely movie just takes you to another world, a completely different settings.
8.0	The conflicts between the righteous and the evil make me wave my fists in the air.
8.0	Each progress the character works her ass off to make and each well-earned reward for that progress just touch my heart and make tears stream down my face.
8.0	It just powers me up with so much motivation for my passion.
8.0	Good movies find you and teach you about yourself and give you hope if you can open your up heart to them.
8.0	They can be so fun, educational in a very relaxing way.
8.0	So are the books.
5.0	Physical exercises also work, but just in a different way.
8.0	"""The pump"" and the sweat are what you are looking for when you utilize your body."
8.0	Blood rushing through every vessel and artery just take your worries away.
8.0	It might now sound so relaxing just yet.
8.0	Then the sweat cools you down to be ready for whatever that is going on in life.
8.0	"And the best part about physical exercise as a meaning of relaxing is ""the athelet high""."
8.0	When you worked hard enough to have your brain release that magical hormone, you will feel like you have the world.
8.0	That is how good and relaxing it feels.
8.0	There is no better feeling than that.
10.0	It improves both the body and the mind.
2.0	Movies and physical exercise are both essential to where I am and who I am today.
10.0	Tehr is
3.0	Nowadays, with development of society the people became the rich, more and more people tend to spend money go to traveling.
12.0	Many people think traveling in own country is better than travelingto foreign countries.
12.0	But l have different idea l think traveling foreign countries can touch some different people and custom.
7.0	First of all, lats year l go to the Thailand play the tennis match
7.0	l don't habe any friend
3.0	In nowadays university,students are usually required to work together in order to finish an assignment provided by their teachers.
3.0	Some students may feel disconfortable with this colaboration with others and have a preference to work on their own.
3.0	But I think its advantages outweigh shortcomes.
4.0	Indeed, some of us often try to avoid communications with others because we think it may disturb our own timetable.
10.0	Sittig in the liberary, looking up for infromation via Internet alone may seem a better choice for us.
4.0	However,working together can offer students more perspectives from others.
8.0	To illustrate, there is no organization running effectively with only merely one employee in it.
8.0	One student is doomed to have some limitations when he is thinking.
8.0	By contrast, if he can join others and start a brain-storming, he could gain much more opinions from various kinds of angles.
8.0	Thus, go to establish a awarness of team spirit, he could solve the problem with more effeciency.
4.0	In addition, group work can always result in time saving.
8.0	When it comes to the study life in schools, it is so essential for us to arrange our time.
8.0	Team up with somenoe else is an optimal choice, let alone you share the same goal, finishing the homework ordered by your teacher.
8.0	In the group work, suppose you are working on a investigation.
8.0	So, one can search for infomation while others can pile up those numbers.
8.0	And eventually you can combine thoose together.
8.0	From cooporating with other classmates, one can save a lot of time since he can only focus on one particular task.
2.0	To sum up, working together on a project is surly effective because it can s
3.0	That the children have excellent performances is the parents' biggest hope.
3.0	The increasing number of parents use unreasonable sollution in order to accelerate their children's passion on study.
12.0	The common method is that the parents give their children money when they performing well in the school.
11.0	In my opinion, I totally disagree with this behavior.
4.0	In the first place, children are not mature enough when they face a lot of money.
8.0	As we know, some young boy cannot distinguish the right behavior and bad behavior.
8.0	A lot of children smoke and buy everything they want when they have a lot of money.
8.0	Take my brother as an instance.
8.0	My brother, Lee, did not good in school in the past and his mother told him that he will get a lot of money if he get good grade in the school.
8.0	He did that latter.
8.0	However, these moeny make him missing.
8.0	He always spend the money buying cigeratte and playing computer game, which made him hatreding the study.
8.0	Finally, these money bring a lot of negative impacts on himself.
8.0	Obviously, Giving money to children is not a good method to encourage boy performing well in the school.
4.0	In the second place, money-oriented education will makes the children get bad concepts.
8.0	Take myself as an instance.
8.0	I am a student and my father promised that if I get A grade he will give me money.
8.0	I am so happy and I study just for the money rather than improving myself.
8.0	Recently, I get a bad habbit that I do every thing just for money I will lose the passion onece I get the reward.
8.0	I lose the passion for the persuing knowledge gradually.
8.0	After that, I always ask money from my parents when I do tasks that are not connected with study.
4.0	Finally, there is a better way to accelerate the children's passion rather than giving them profits.
9.0	The most important thing is that parents let their children know the importance of the studying and studying is for themself rather than for others.
9.0	Onece children know that, they will work hard without any profits.
1.0	To sum up, I oppose the behavior that giving money for children.
1.0	This behavior just brings a lot negative impacts on them.
11.0	Whenever asked people's attitudes towards if we can learn about a person from the books and movies that this person like, they usually exhibit an air of uncertanity.
11.0	Some advocate that we can learn about a person from the books and movies that this person like, while others claim that we can not.
12.0	I agree with the first opinion for two reasons, the books and movies that people read or watch can reflect their hobbys and good books and movies can influce people.
5.0	First, the books and movies that people read or watch can reflect their hobbys.
9.0	If someone likes to play basketball very much and hates football, then it will not be a suprise to see many basketball magzines and hardly any books about footbal in his home.
9.0	For example, my father likes to do tai-ji very much, so he often buy books about tai-ji to read and watch videos about it, he says it can improve his skills.
5.0	Secondly, good books and movies can influce people.
9.0	If someone reads a good book, he will problebally find the story touching and moving, so he will be influced by it and he will begin to like that kind of book, so he will be influced more and more.
9.0	For example, one year ago, one of my class mates was very outgoing and she acted like she was a boy, one day she read a book about a romantic love story and she found it really touching, so she began to read more, and now she is not very outgoing and she acted like a normal girl again.
2.0	Althogh some times people will choose to go with the flow and read or watch whatever is popular, they can not really reflect the person's personality and they will noy truly like it.
10.0	Because the books and movies that people read or watch can reflect their hobbys and good books and movies can influce people, I agree with the statment that we can learn about a person from the books and movies that this person like.
3.0	In comtemporary society, it is become a tendency that parents are paying increasing attention to the education of their children.
12.0	As a result of this, some of the parents decide many ways to encourage their children to study hard, like offer money for each high grade.
12.0	Some people indicate that this will lead children to regard money as the only propose of study.
11.0	However in my perspective, it's a good idea for children to learn efficiently.
4.0	To start with, giving money to childrens as a reward can encourage children to study harder.
8.0	Sometimes, children may become bored and tired when they face with some learning difficulties or have been already study for a while.
8.0	At this time it is particularly important for them to have parents' reward.
8.0	If they know that they can get come bouns and use this money to buy the things they like, the children will always be motivated to learn and keep in high efficiency.
4.0	For another part, offer some money to children can give a chance for them to learn how to manage their own money.
8.0	This way the could not only benifit from use the money to buy the things they they like, but also help them learn how to manage their property ahead of time.
8.0	For example, my mother used to give me some money as a reward when I was young and as the first time I got my own money, I use that money to start my own acount in the bank.
8.0	After that, I start to learn how to save money and keep all the money in my account.
8.0	Nowadays I have a small fortune and never waste money on unnecessary things.
4.0	Admittedly, it is unwise to give too much money once a time when children get a good grade, since the children will only focus on the money that study brings to them.
9.0	Too much reward will make children neglect the benifits of learning.
9.0	However,, if we make sure that children will not mis understanding the meaning of the reward and keep a health attitude to the money, it will not affect anything.
2.0	From what I have discussed above, it can be concluded that it is good for parents to give their children money as a reward for getting high mark in school.
3.0	Nowadays,more and more sudents have their own money to buy anything they like just beacause they behave well.
3.0	Parents give valuable present or justr money to their kids that have high mark in school.
11.0	In my perspective ,it's reaaly not a good idea.
4.0	To start with, giving money to their kids eho have a high mark in subject will encourage them to do better and let kids know that having a gooa grades lead to a sweet and happy life.
10.0	Nevertheness,even thogh kids do a good job ,if parents give them mony and they probably by toys and in this way they may lose interest in studying.
4.0	consequently,if kids are offered money just because they have a high mark,tey will think mony is too easy to acquire and it's natural to gain money if they behave well.
9.0	In this way kids will have a harmful perspective in their young age,and as a result it may let them do everything just for mony.
9.0	Probably,in this way kids will lose interest in studying and become less active if they are not given money.
4.0	Besides,kids may use this money to do bad things.
10.0	For example ,my cousin Lee,he used to be a good students but since he receive money fro his parents, he become overconfident and use this money to buy ciggarete and become a To sum it up ,Ireally disagreewith this.
3.0	The topic disscussed here is whether people are willing to help the struggling strangers.
3.0	"From my point of view, the answer  is definitely ""Yes"" for three general reasons."
3.0	First of all, the basis of people helping others is economic foundation.
3.0	If one is not able to take care of himself, it could be impossible for him to lend a hand to others.
3.0	In the past, we were living in a poorer condition than now, and we were busy with earning a life and surpporting a family.
3.0	We actually did't have the money and energy to think about strangers.
11.0	However, we are living in a way better condition now.
10.0	We do have the economic foundation to care about others.
5.0	Since we had acquired the money and time to help strangers, the willingness of helping others could be the second important factor.
8.0	As social animals, we human beings are meant to live with a certain group.
8.0	Only through social interactions can we survive and envolve.
8.0	Therefore, the willingness of helping others is a kind od instinct of hunman beings since our exitence.
8.0	Most of us are willing to help others from the deep of heart, and we are clearly aware of that we would get benefits from it.
5.0	Last but not least, education is the crucial factor of the whole process.
8.0	Sometimes we have the physical and mental conditions to help the struggling strangers, but do not know when and how.
8.0	Here education plays the role to teach people how to help others properly and timely without embarrassing them.
8.0	Morever, education also has its great influence on the economic foundation and willingness of helping for its use in teaching people to live well and cultivating the mentality of helping stuggling ones.
2.0	To have a summary, for the better economic foundation, willingness of helping and education, I agree with the statement that people today are more willing to help struggling strangers.
3.0	At present, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among students: whether being creative will come up with the best solution to a problem rather than planning carefully.
3.0	Answers vary from one to another.
3.0	Some people claim that being creative and imaginative is a key element to work out a solution of a problem.
11.0	However, contrary to their view comes my own perspective that planning carefully in advance is really important in dealing with some difficult situation.
11.0	My point of view is based on the following reasons.
5.0	First, people will have a clearer mind toward the problems they face after making a plan carefully.
8.0	To be more specific, when dealing with some hard situations, people who are accustomed to making a meticulous schedule will break the tasks into smaller parts and then establish a more detailed list of each part in order, which will make problems more easier to solve.
8.0	In this way, figuring out each solution to each smaller part is a piece of cakes.
8.0	However, being creative cannot be a long-term solution to problems for some clever ideas cannot always flash into people's mind in time, which finally fail to go through the hard situation.
8.0	For example, my uncle Jack who works in an Internet company needs to deal with many difficulties in his work such as optimization of computer programs, fixing the bugs and computing some programs under experiment but he never makes mistakes in his work.
8.0	The reason why he can always work it out is that he will make a detailed plan in advance when he start to finish the tasks such as when to finish the plan A and where to complete the plan B.
5.0	Second, making a plan meticulously can also leave enough time and prevent some emergencies from happening.
8.0	Specifically, if people make a plan carefully, they will have a comprehensive understanding of the time they need and the whole process.
8.0	Under this circunstance, people will always finish the tasks ahead of schedule if they do as what they have already planned.
8.0	The extra time could be used for them to perfect what they've finished and also give people opportunity to figure out solution when some emergencies happens.
8.0	However, only being creative doesn't mean people have such a capacity to handle some surprising situations.
8.0	For example, I always keep a habit of making a careful time list before doing everything such as daily study tasks.
8.0	One day, my professor suddenly assigned me a task to do a survey about interest rates of recent years, which totally interfened my plan.
8.0	Thanks to the time list which left some extra time after all tasks, I could finish my assignment on time.
7.0	In conclusion, making a plan meticulously is of great importance when people are faced some problems for it can not only make people have a clearer mind to handle some hard situations but also prevent some emergencies happening
7.0	I agree.
12.0	I think relax by doing physical exercise is good,but it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a bok than relax by physical exercise.
8.0	With the development  of the city,movie theatre and book shop become more and more,we can go there with our best friends or classmates.
8.0	then,it can make us relax.
8.0	If the weather is bad,we can watch a movie or read a dook on computer.
8.0	watching a movie or reading a book can get more knowledges.
8.0	As me,I am crazy about watching a movie,because the movie star are all handsome or beautiful .
8.0	Some movies make me laugh and some movies make me cry.
8.0	My favoite book is HARRY POTER,it is very exciting.
3.0	Nowadays, there are lots of news and events happening all over around the world.
3.0	There are lots of applications in the phone reporting the events everyday to you.
3.0	Also, many TV programs will convey the everyday news to you.
11.0	However, there are lots of people think that it's not necessary for people to care about the events which will not affect their daily life.
11.0	However in my opinion, it's important for us to know about the events aroung the world.
9.0	Though the things haven't the closely connection with the life of myself.
9.0	And here are three reasons about my opinion.
5.0	First of all, people can read lots of interesting things through knowing about the events all around the world.
8.0	People can read much interesting, moving and novelty things due to many TV programs which will introduce many interesting events for the audience.
8.0	So it's with the news recommendation of the phones' applications.
8.0	As is known to all, people will feel so tired about the day of work that they want to relax.
8.0	So they can read about many intereting events from all over the world they haven't heard before even though the things have no connection of their lives.
5.0	Additionally, people can know about much important knowledge about many aspects of life.
8.0	Nowadays, after the education of the school, many people can't have other chances to learn other knoledge about the life except the reading of the events happening all over around.
8.0	People actually can learn many little tips to ease their life and learn many important lessons which the life itself will not teach us.
8.0	It seems that many events around the world will not affect on many people.
8.0	If you learn some things, they can help you when you are in trouble like the earthquakes
2.0	Finally, it only spend little time to read over those events.
11.0	I agree with the state that it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing phsical exercise.
11.0	Because I think relaxing our minds is more important than relaxing our bodies.
12.0	With the development of economy and technology,it provides more and more opportunities for the people to enjoy the life ,which contributes much for them to living in the mordern society that fulls of pressure and indensity .
11.0	There is a fierce discussion that which way the people would like to.
11.0	Some people prefer a quiet way such as waiting a movie or reading a book than doing than doing physical exercise while others have  a opposed opinion.
10.0	As far as I am concerned,I am into the former one for the following reasons.
6.0	In the first place,my physical condition was not allowed me to do too much exercise,therfore i developed a habit to do something that was not active to spend my leisure time .
9.0	And now,i am of great interested in wacthing movies that i can totally addicted to it and forget all things related to me,especially the unhappiness or failure.
9.0	Of coures,if i cannot find some movies that i like,i will read the books .
2.0	In addition, after doing physical exercise,most of us will be tired and only want to sleep.
10.0	It is not convennient for us because lots of people have a great deal of work or study to do and we don't have enough time to relax,so that wacthing a movie is the best way for me.
3.0	In the comtemporary world,many parents holp their children have good education,and some parents choose spend more money to let their children in the high grade school,but I  think that's a good idea.
11.0	I will explain why I think that in follows.
6.0	Children need a confortable enviroment of learning.
8.0	If children in the good place learning, they will feel  happy and more motivate.
8.0	We all know spend more money,and you can get better resourse of  study.
8.0	A typical example is that cultivate hobby,a nommore school haven't enough teacher and ability to develop student's hobbies,and school facility often old and can't satisfact teach needs,such some school don't have tennise place,so the students can't play.
9.0	A high grade school have excellent teacher.
9.0	In school,the most improtant focus is teacher,
11.0	In my opinion,how much money is given to students depends on how much they actually need,but not the grade.
11.0	Study is students` career not their parents.
12.0	Offerring school-age children money for each high grade they get in school would present them a wrong idea that what all I have done is for my parents,they are boss and I am enployer.
11.0	Instead ,I think we should give courage to who get a low grade in school.
10.0	It is because they who get high grade are already happy ,but they who get low grade are very sad.
6.0	A high grade does not mean the student offers more efforts,in the same time ,a low grade does not mean less effort either.
8.0	As we know ,the god give different person different gifts.
8.0	Therefore some people are good at learning,some are not.
8.0	However ,it may be not their fault that they get a low mark.
8.0	What we need to do is to find the real gift given by god.
2.0	Parents should not estimate their children by the grae they get in school,which is not eligible parents` choice.
3.0	As we all know, many skills can be learned by people's efforts since he or she was born.
3.0	But have you ever heard about some skills that cannot be learned?
11.0	Some may say that it should be the leadership.
12.0	Can't one really learn to be a leader?
12.0	The answer is yes.
8.0	As far as I'm concerned, everyone can learn to be a leader.
8.0	Because leadership is also a kind of skill.
8.0	And many people have the strong mind, which will make them pay their whole efforts.
5.0	Firstly, leadership is not a kind of gift since one was born.
8.0	On the contrary, it is a kind of skill that can be learned by one's efforts.
8.0	Taking my uncle for example, when he was in the college, he dreamed of becoming a manager in a big company thus he will make lots of money.
8.0	But at that time, he was shy and even could not dare to say something in front of  the class.
8.0	But he had made the decision to change all those things.
8.0	And started to train himself before he graduated.
8.0	He was so hard working that he got up at 5 A.M. everyday and practiced the speaking skills on the top of the floor.
8.0	Finally, he was very confident about that after he had graduated and he eventually became a selling manager in a big automobile company.
8.0	That's what we can see, leadership is just one kind of skill.
5.0	Secondly, many people have strong wills.
8.0	Thus it is likely for them to learn such a leader's skill.
8.0	Just like Bill Gates.
8.0	No one can image how difficult it is for him such a college student to creat the own business in the society.
8.0	But he did it.
8.0	He had made it for the whole world for invented the DOS and Windows.
8.0	And there's no doubt that he had paid much efforts on it.
2.0	Undoubtedly, leadership sometimes is seen to be n ability since one was born.
7.0	But actulay
3.0	If the teachers share their social or political views known to students, the students could know more about the government and the society.
3.0	This kind of action would help the students who would works in the governments a lot.
11.0	I will show my reasons are on the below.
4.0	First, if the teachers share their views known to their students, the students could take part in the society quickly.
8.0	For example, there is two students, but hte first one get more information about the society and the politics, who will fet into the society quickly?
8.0	I think it should be the first one.
8.0	Because he could know more about the society and the politics by listening to the teachers.
8.0	So this is the first benefit of the students who get more information about the society and the politics.
4.0	Second, the teachers' experience about the society and the politics could help a lot of the student who is going to work in the government.
8.0	Because the student who has more knowledge about the society and the politics could deal with the people who is fron the other part of the government.
8.0	If the student who is going to work in the government does not have the enough experience about the government and the society, the student would produce a lot of problems that is not easy to resolve.
8.0	So this kind of the experience is improtant of the students.
4.0	But some people would say that, he will not goes into the government or some companies, he could also do some works which is not high value.
8.0	Then I will ask, although you do not goes into the companies and the governments, you must survive in the society.
8.0	"There was a sentence which was said by a famous philosopher is that""There is no people who could survive out of the society."""
8.0	So if you do not goes into the governments and the companies, you must survive in the society.
8.0	So I think the knowledge of the society and the politics which was said by the teachers is so improtant.
2.0	So that's why I don't agree with the statement which was given by the question.
3.0	With the explosion of information and news about events happenening brocasted around world, people are ususally intended to catch up with them all the times.
12.0	However, I disagree with the idea that it is improtant to know about these events, whcih even won't affect my daily life to the slicest degree.
4.0	To begin with, our attention is scarce and should be put in more meaningful ways.
8.0	As a research conducted by Pew institute shows that most signfiicant events happend in the previous acctually become not as important as when they were firstly brocasted.
8.0	This means that most news are exaggerated to some degree in order to catch people's attention.
8.0	Because for them, attention is bussiness and means money.
8.0	If we dovote our attention to their bussiness, we are doing their good but not ours.
8.0	Our attention are precious to us and should be put in more valuble way.
8.0	For example, we can invest it in reading or keeping our body fit.
4.0	On the other hand, it is hard for ordinary people to distinguish the truth and easily be misled during the broadcasting of the events.
8.0	For one politcal event, different parties can broadcast it in a different way.
8.0	For example, for Sino-American trade war, Trump administration thinks that the American is the victims of the trade between the two nations.
8.0	however, China posses the different oppion, it is Amerca who initiates this war and China is the victim.
8.0	If people with no cirtical thinking are easily manipulated and contributes to the misunderstanding of certain events.
4.0	Finally, knowing is an  inferior way to learning, and won't benefit our lives in a fundamental way.
8.0	Konwing the events is not our priority, but thinking process is.
8.0	If we want to catch with the events around the world, we never sccueed when comparing with computer and books.
8.0	We should differentiate our human beings from those non-living things.
8.0	Thinking is more precious than knowing.
8.0	When we devote more time in thinking, we can actually devise more constructive creations such as computer and machines for human to improve their lives.
2.0	In conculsion, I disagree to invest time to know about events happening around the world due to following three aspects: our attention is scarce, it hard to discern the truth behind the broadcasting and there are better ways to improve our lives than knowing events.
11.0	When people get the new information, they will consider about whether it is important to know about the events happening around the world though these events will not influence people's daliy life.
12.0	Varied persons have distinct idea.
11.0	Some people think the most indispensible thing is to know about the events which will affect our life.
11.0	However,  I hold the view that it is essensial for people to know about the events unrelated to our daliy life.
5.0	First, it will broaden peoples horizen.
8.0	Through knowing about the events which unlikely affect our daily life, people are able to obtain more knowlege.
8.0	Since they may know about the world is wonderful and variety which will encourage people explore the unknow.
8.0	On the contrary, if people just acquire the information about their daliy life, they will be limited in their life circle, they will become lazy and lost the passion for world.
8.0	My cousin John is case in point.
8.0	He liked reading the magzine about the astronomy which is distant to our daily life.
8.0	He knew much about the frontier resereach about the outer space.
8.0	He always tell us the story about the space with passion and he want to join the NASA in the future.
5.0	Second, it will provide people  braveness to realize their dream come true.
8.0	Persons can know many  great enterpriner though the events unrelated to  their daliy life.
8.0	With the encouraging stories about enterpriners' life, people will become brave to the break the limitation, and chase their dream.
8.0	But, if people just think themselves have no ablility to attain their dream, and be addicited to failure and frustrated, they even have no chance to win the goal.
8.0	For example, my mother was a housewife and she read the interview about famale business.
8.0	She began to have a try to do her own business which is her childhood drea.
8.0	She open a restestaut  and success.
7.0	To sum up, it is important to know the event
3.0	In modern world, we can hear that there are increasingly number of people complain about their life.
3.0	And many people think that thay are under much pressure,which will lead to the coldmess of personality.
11.0	So,if there is misunderstanding or quarrel happens in the ground, I do not think there will be many people today willing to help the struggling strangers.
5.0	The first reason I hold this view is we do not want to take extra responsibility.
8.0	What if there has someone injured, or there has something unexpected happened.
8.0	Although we can probably satisfy our hero dream if wo choose to help them, if we do that ,we have to solve this struggle and waste our time.
8.0	For most of us, time and enegy is precious.
8.0	I believe that most of us will not help person we even dont know.
5.0	Secondly, if there has someone one quarrelled or struggled in public, police will get there and solve it right away.
8.0	Moreover,there will be relative to help them handle it.
8.0	After all, we are stranger for them, and I do not think we can understand the whole reason why they quallel and who is right in a short time.
8.0	If we help them ,we may make misunderstamding,even making condition get more serious.
10.0	In a word ,
3.0	These days, some peopleare concerned about what is the best to teach the children.
12.0	Should parents make them make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.
11.0	While some disagree to let their children make mistakes, I think they should let children learn from their mistakes.
11.0	I will use three specific ideas to support my view.
5.0	First, I think children are unlikely to be willing to listen to their parents.
8.0	some of the adolesents even feel more than delihted to annoy their parents.
8.0	However, they are afaid of making mistakes, which they will remember forever.
8.0	For instance, my cousin, who is not interested in botany but he finally choose it as his elective class for only one reason, to annoy his parents by disobeying their suggestions.
8.0	They have discovereed his interest in astronomy while my cousin even did not discover himself, so they offered my cousin a solution.
8.0	Avoiding the right path my aunt and uncle had chosen for him, he finally paid for his mistake.
8.0	He failed his classes.
8.0	Finally he leanrt from his own mistake automatically and attend the university to consider atronomy as his major.
8.0	So, it is important to transfer the teaching pattern from giving suggestions into letting children learn from their mistakes.
5.0	Moreover, for some children willind to follow others' advices, it is hard for them to memorize the solutions to the problems because they do not make mistakes.
9.0	It will sometimes be really terrible when a man make mistakes, which will helip them to remember clearly the solution yto the problems.
9.0	For example, my sister , who like to follow may parents but do not like to memorize the solution, my parents finally decide to make her rememder the mistaken experience, which makes her know how to deal with the problems next time.
1.0	Even though making mistakes may not be good in some situation, I still think it is the best way for a child to learn, since it can avoid the phenenomenon that kids are tired of listen to their parents and the another one that they do not like to mem.
1.0	So it is much more important to learn from mistakes than to simply learn from suggestions.
3.0	Although money can provides power to inspire learning ability,it dosen't a good method to educate school-age children.
11.0	It will cause a deviant sense of worth.
11.0	Money become them goal to gain the success.
12.0	So I think some parents offer their children some money when they get high grade in school doesn't a good idea.
11.0	There are many reasons to support my opinion.
4.0	First at all,students study in the school in order to exercise their capebilities to find a good job in the future.
8.0	They can make live by themselves.
8.0	Parents should let them know why they study in the school,why they hardly offer a high tuition.
8.0	Use money can't deal with the root problems.
8.0	Parents should use other methods to promote them children's grade,such as communication and let them join in some communities' survey.
8.0	Parents also can ask from teacher how could they educate school-age.
4.0	Secondly,parents can put the money which will award for them children when they get high grade in the many training organizations.
8.0	It can make them get exactly knowleage.
8.0	Parents can accroding them prefer to choose what training organizations suit with them.
8.0	It can let them make more friends to practice them speaking skill,and can broaden them horizon,they will have different angle to handle some questions.
8.0	It can potentially increase them grade.
4.0	Tiredly,if parents give their children some money when they just a school-age,their children will become very dangerious,because they have lots of money in their paggage.
8.0	Criminal will aims them when they buy some goods.
8.0	And then,money will make school-age do somethings which they don't allowed to do in this age.
8.0	Such as early to fall in love and touch some social people and have enough money to play computer games.
7.0	All in all,this methods is a double-edged swords,but I disagree with this educational way
3.0	Many people like watching television expecially nowadays many advancing products have been produced.
3.0	Goods can be sold not only in the shop but also can sale online  television show.
3.0	This is a win-win mode for the fast developing era.
11.0	In my perspective, I disagree with the statement.
12.0	Here comes the reasons.
4.0	Firstly, I think television advertising for children in directly is according to thier needs.
8.0	Only people need these product can bussinessman gain thier profit.
8.0	Take toys and tools for example, my sister is only one year old.
8.0	One night we were watching TV show, she shouted when the advertising was showing on the TV.
8.0	She asked her mom but she couldn't speak out the words, she shouted and with aome murmurs instead.
8.0	After a long time that my anut understood that she wanted that toys.
8.0	My anut Coco buy a set of toys which have letters on them.
8.0	She really likes to play toys which can make up her own catsle, each piece of toy has it's own number.
8.0	These days I find that she can put these number together and learn letters in a natural way.
8.0	I think this advertisment is really helpful for children and aldults.
4.0	Secondly, I think  television advertising is also a time to remind parents that it's time to relax.
8.0	As we all know Children are favor of cartoon, I'am the cartton fan even I'm already 21.
8.0	But this is also the consequece of the cartoon fun that I have to wear glasses.
8.0	My parents are not awared of eyesight when I was a child.
8.0	I insisted in watching TV day and night, my eyes hadn't been relaxed until I went to bed.
8.0	So I really want to go back to the days that my parents forgot to remind me to have a rest.
8.0	It were benificial to my health if  I would take a reast during the advertising time.
4.0	However, you may think that advertising are so commercialized to the kids, but you have right to ignore it and teach your children a lesson instead.
8.0	This is also a good time to teach your children about saving money in a potential way.
8.0	Buying things online or wathcing advertisimg doesn't mean is not allowed.
8.0	You should be a rational people that prevent ourselves from implusive motivation.
8.0	For example shoppaholic, they're not sensible enough and become horroble sometimes.
0.0	In the nutshell, I hold the belief that it can be allowed that television advertising for children in a directly way.
0.0	There has many merits other than disadvantages.
0.0	Moreover, It cannot only help the children but also the parents that  television advertising time is also a enjoyable time, family members can communicate with other when television advertising is displayed.
0.0	Have fun and take care of your children!
11.0	I don't agree to the statement that relaxing by watching a movie or reading a book is better than doing physical exercise.
11.0	There are three reasons to support my opinion.
4.0	Firstly, whether it's watching a movie or reading a book, our minds are still engaged in mental activity.
9.0	We have to keep up with the story line, process the meaning behind words, analyse the characters etc.
9.0	While doing physical exercise, on the other hand, allows us to set our minds free from anymore thinking and let our bodies do what it was made for.
4.0	Secondly, studies have shown that doing physical exercise can effectively lower our stress level.
8.0	While doing physical exercise, our bodies creates chemicals that can bring the feeling of happiness.
8.0	Doing physical exercise also facilitates metabolism, allowing our bodies to bring out waste, renewing our bodies.
8.0	What's more, after exercising, we tend to have a better appetite, bring about the additional joy of enjoying food to our lives.
4.0	Last, whether it's doing physical exercise indoors in a gym or outdoors in a park, other than bringing a change to our physical environment, it brings our life into motion.
8.0	A lot of people nowadys spend a shocking amount of time sitting in front of computer desks.
8.0	Through watching a movie or reading a book, we only change what we are doing and not our state of sitting down.
8.0	Usually stress comes from monotony, from dullness.
8.0	We already spend enough time sitting, changing from sitting down doing work to sitting down watching a movie doesn't bring about much change.
8.0	Moreoever, outdoor exercise enables us to feel the pleasant feeling of the air brushing against our faces.
8.0	Exercising with a friend,  having a nice chat while in a game enhnaces our friendship and brings about a positive change to our everyday life.
2.0	Above are reasons why doing physical exercise is a better method of relaxing than watching a movie or reading a book.
11.0	A excellent education can affect one person's all life.
11.0	With the society becoming increasingly competitive, people put more value in  university education.
12.0	Should universityes spend more money on salaries for university professors?
11.0	Some viewers think that it is not necessary because universities should spend more money on teaching capacity.
11.0	However, in my opinion, it is important that universities should spend  more money on salaries for university professors.
4.0	Some peolple claim that universities should spend more money on teaching capacities.
8.0	Undoubtedly, teaching capacities are very important in the universities as its can help students and professors do some deeper research.
8.0	However, that improve the quality of professors is the fundamation doing more deeper reseach.
8.0	There is not good teacher leading students, the top capacities just are waste.
4.0	To begin, improving professors' salaries can make professors concentrate in the work.
8.0	Nowadays, more and more professors use their all life contributing in the studying and teaching but their salaries unable to afford their family, which makes the some professors have to take part time jorb earning money.
8.0	To some expand, my professors Lee, he is a very nice person.
8.0	He spend mostly forty years on his reseach but he cannot sustain that because his salary is highly low.
8.0	He cannot afford his son's school fee.
8.0	He must stop the reseach and take part time job in order to make his son going to the top university.
8.0	Low salaries resist a lot of research results occuring.
8.0	I believe if universities spend more money on salaries for professors, that can icrease the teaching quality and give professor's work ambition.
4.0	Furthermore, universities spend more money on salaries for professors can hire more prominent.
8.0	For instance, my sister Jenny, she is major in computer science and she is really smart.
8.0	When she considering whether jor she should choose, to be a teacher in universities or take participate in a computer companey.
8.0	She choos latter because the salary in company is highly high.
2.0	To sum up, universitie spend more money on salaries can absorb moe
12.0	When we talk to the relationship between parents and thier children, we always think the parents should be a teacher to their kids, and parents have their duty to remaind their kids do not make the mistakes.
12.0	But as far as i am concerned, parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes, because only in this way, can a kid remember important things impressive.
5.0	As we know, at an early stage, children are always expecting to eat or walk with the help of their parents.
8.0	and in order to help the kids do it more quickly, we always  tell them the right things directly rather than teach them from their own experience.
8.0	As my own experience for example, my niece, whose age was 5 years old, not be able to use chopsticks.
8.0	As my sister told me that she never let my niece use the chopsticks, because when my niece use it, she did it in the wrong way, and after my sister taught her once ,she still can't use it.
8.0	In order to finish the meal quick, my sister give her the spoon instead and finally, my niece didn't have any chance to make mistake by using chopsticks, and she can't use it by now.
8.0	However, I can still remember when I was at her age, my mom told me how to use it one time,and than I just try to it by myself, after try again and again, maybe I spent more time than others to finish my meal, but finally I learnt how to use it and it made me feel very satisfied.
5.0	And when we in childhood, we can be easily disturbing the by variety of test in ourschool.
9.0	Math test or so on which just have the only one correct answer.
9.0	If the parents just tell us the right anwer, we maybe never know how to deal with the math problem correctly and when we face the same question again in the fulture, the first thing we remember may not the way to solve the problem but to ask our parents for help.
2.0	So make mistakes can never be wrong, children from time to time make different kinds of mistakes------initially many of which are natural but later other mistakes could turn out to be undedirable.
10.0	But just take it easy, the events can help them grow up and the mistake can be very important in their whole life.
12.0	Recently, a controversial topic has aorused the heated debate: whether your job has more effect on your happiness than social life does.
11.0	Opinion varies from person to another.
11.0	Some claim that because the social life is more relaxing than job, so it could bring about more happiness than your job does.
11.0	However, contrary to their view comes my perspective that jobs could make more contribution in the happiness than social life does.
12.0	My points are elaborated as follow.
5.0	Firstly, jobs could guarantee our daily basic physical needs.
8.0	If a person obtain a well-paied job, he is able to earn a lot of money, so that he could spend much money in meeting his basic requirements, such as high quality of the clothes, delicious foods and the cool private car, leading to his happiness.
8.0	By contrast, the social life could not help him earn much money to guarantee the daily life.
8.0	If he can't afford the living cost, he must worry about whether he could eat his next lunch and be full of anxiety and negetive emotion obviously.
8.0	Imaging a situation, if a person gains ninety thousand yuan a month, he could  spend one thousand yuan in eating the delicious foods in a splendid restuarant, becasue of the high quality of the foods and the good service in the restuarant, he feels comfortable and happy.
5.0	In addition, jobs could also provide us various achievements, which makes us happy.
8.0	In some situation, the jobs are complex and challenging, so that seldom people could accomplish it in a short time.
8.0	If you work hard and find a effective method to solve the problem and finish this difficult job in the limited time, you could obtain much appreciation from your colleages, leading to your happiness which social life could not provide.
8.0	By contrast, if you don't challenge the difficulty in the work, there is no chance for you to experience this happiness of success.
8.0	For example, my brother worked in the Internet company.
8.0	In a program, he solve the problem which other people in his company are not able to deal with, and then the leader realized his talent and hard working,  and gave him a high evluation, which makes my brother very happy.
2.0	In conlusion, it is necessary to repeat my point that jobs have more effect on the happiness than social life does, because it could provide not only the basic needs for a high quality of life but also various achievement which could not exist in the social life.
3.0	I totally agree with the statement that watching a film or reading a book is a better method to relax.
3.0	It is not unusual for someone to lose his temper when he or she meets some untolerable.
11.0	Then, relax oneself is extremely important for one's health.
11.0	Althouth it is true that doing physical exercise is an excellent form of relaxtion, doing something else mentally is far more effective to calm oneself.
10.0	Here are two reasons for that.
5.0	It comes first that watching a movie or reading a book can make one feel calm.
8.0	When someone is irritable, he can hardly do any physical exercise to diatract his consentration.
8.0	However, an intriguing movie or book,especially an interesting one, can easily catch one's attention to something else.
8.0	Thus making him feel relaxed.
8.0	It is also known to all that book is one of the most effective method to cure people's negative emotion such as angre and fear.
5.0	Besides the fact that it can make people calmer, one can also be inspired from books or moive.
8.0	These inspirations may lead people to think about and concentrate on something else, and some even can trigger a practical solution to the present problem.
8.0	I remember clearly that the day after my university entrance exam, one which i prepare for almost three years.
8.0	The moment i step out of the text room i feel my world collapse because i did really bad and may probably have no access to my dreamed university.
8.0	I'm so depressed that i wasn't feel like doing anything until i read a quotation in a book called Three Days to See.
8.0	I was greatly inspired by the author who suffer a lot from the lost of her eyesight but still full of energy and work hard and went so far.
8.0	Than i noticed that i mustn't give up.
8.0	That is what the books teach me, and make me feel a great burden taken off.
1.0	So next time when you are feeling exhausted, you'd better pick up a book and start to read.
1.0	Perhaps there is something which can make you feel relaxed just inside it, or at least it can make you focus on another more joyful thing.
11.0	I don‘t think it’s  a good idea.
11.0	First of all,I think students have to develp their own independent.
11.0	Also I think students need to try to be responsible to the family , school or even their classmates.
12.0	If students can make money at that time,I think they will have enough social experience to deal with eveything they will meet in the future.
8.0	Let me take a example ,the CEO of Microsoft already got his own business when he was only 19.
8.0	Although his mother was a successful business women ,and his father was excellent politician.
8.0	But he make his own brilliant when he was 21.
8.0	He is Bill Gates .
8.0	there is no doubt that how sucssful he is,when he telling his own story ,everybody think that was unbeliveable ,but he made it!
8.0	Then when he was rich enough his donations was high to 2,000,000,000,000.
6.0	Time flies ,now it's 21st century,we have to make our own business to let our pretents or teachers pround os us.
9.0	If we have ability to handle with our school money .
9.0	it's will reduce yhe financial burden on families.
2.0	All in all,it's good to see yourself paying tultion in any wayI don‘t think it’s  a good idea.
12.0	Recently, the phenomenon about some parents offer money to their school age children for each high mark they get in school caused wide public concern.
8.0	Some point out that this action will mislead children, makes them belive that money is the only purpose they study, however, I think it is a good chiose to giver children some money as a reward.
8.0	To start with giving children rewards acan stimulate children to study harder, I regard it as an encouragement.
8.0	When children get a feedback after study, they will have a sence of self-accomplishment.
8.0	With no question, study contain a lot of harfd work and boring exercise, the best way to let them keep their interest in study is offer them some money and buy what they want as a gift.
8.0	Second, giving children money can develop their ability to manage money.
8.0	Nowadays,financial abilitiy is very improtant and useful to morden people, during the method that giving children their own monry, childen will have the chance to manage them.
8.0	For example, my father give me my first amount of money at my age of 8,I try to save the money in the saving pot.
8.0	But I can't help to take the money out and buy a gift for myself, I used up the my in 2 days.
8.0	I finally realized that making money is not easy to make money, we should cherish every cent we earn.
8.0	With not doubt ,giving children to much money as their award for getting a high mark is not correct, what we expect is to encourage them and tell them the purpose o
7.0	In my point of view, the opinion of the essay is more than reasonnable.
3.0	If a worker does similar tasks all day long, it will certainly make him or her feel bored.
3.0	It's even more unbearable to repeate the sme work day by day.
3.0	By contrast, if a worker have various types of tasks to do during the workady, he or she will be not likely to lose interest.
3.0	I have a deep understanding of it, since I once worked in a small company.
11.0	My experiences are as follows.
5.0	Two years ago, I worked as a clerk in an office, which is not very large but quite clowded.
8.0	What I did during this period was just write down the information about the product of our company.
8.0	When my company sold some products, I needed to note how many it has sold, how much it has got and how much it has earned.
8.0	In the begining, I didn't feel bored and felt just good.
8.0	But  after two months, I can't wthstand it anymore.
8.0	The work made me just like a machine with no spirit, so did my workmates.
8.0	Finally, I quitted the job and began hunting for a more inspiring more.
5.0	Nearly three months later, I really found what I dreamed of.
8.0	I worked as a tutor in a high school, which required various skills.
8.0	Sometimes, I talked with some students about their study and helped them find out the solution of their problems.
8.0	And there were also times when I was  playing with some students,which was of great significance to me.
8.0	I was always trying to find a way to get back to my schoolhood.
8.0	One of my dreams was to stay young and innocent.
8.0	Staying with students really provided me with such an invaluable opportunity.
8.0	Because I could do different kinds of work from talking with srudents to helping teachers prepare the exams everyday, I always felt satisfied.
1.0	My exprience tells me that one could do different kinds of work all day long without losing interest,and that one can't bear the simple work if he or she has to do it for a long time.
1.0	I believe others are similar to me.
3.0	"Once i attended a lecture,i was enjoying those professor's statment until one of the professor said:""Poor people cannot be as intelligent as those wealthy."""
3.0	And i was completely shocked since this saying was very discriminatory to poor students.
3.0	Therefore, i stood up and interrupt the professor to correct what he had said.
3.0	However, afterward i recieve many negative comments because i corrected professor's statment during his lecture.
3.0	And this thing leads me to think if i meet this thing again in the future, i should do the same thing as before, be quiet, or correct him after he finishs the whole lecture.
11.0	In my opinion, i perfer the second method.
6.0	First of all, the second way has more positive impact on other listeners.
8.0	Since the meeting leader says his ideas in the meeting room, there are many other person who listen carefully to the meeting with you in the meanwhile.
8.0	"If you just open your mouth and say ""I don't argee with your ideas."", you may interrupt others' thinking despite of the leader's statment."
8.0	As we all know, you should feel for others when you decide to do something that will infect others.
8.0	For example, if you're thinking a math problem and suddenly your mother comes to your room and exclaims that you should eat dinner, you will be angery and let her get out the room.
8.0	Similiarly, if you interrupt others' thinking, they will be mad at your behavior and maybe think you as a inpolite person.
8.0	As a result, the first method would leaves bad impression.
8.0	Furthermore, the third method is not very intelligent.
8.0	If the meetin leader really says something that many people don't agree but you say nothing about it, other people will think you have the same opinion as the meetin leader even though you just don't want to correct his statment.
8.0	Thereby, others maybe have some bad comments on you and you maybe hurt in both mental and physical by their verbal attack.
8.0	Consequently, the first and the last solution both have negetive impact on you and they're not suitable resolution to this complex circumstance.
7.0	Moreover, i think the second way make sure the me
12.0	I think the extended family is not so necessary now than it was in the previous time,  since I have several reasons to support my viewpoint.
5.0	First, the members of extened family is unfamilliar with us.
8.0	Nowadays, the time which we dedicate to our extended family is limited because people should shoulder various responsibilities, like many adults need to make plenty of money to nurture their children, and children need to study hard for their future.
8.0	For this reason, the contaction among our extended family and us is restricted.
8.0	To illustrate, I could see my uncle only once a year when it is New Years Day, for he work in abroad, and the airport ticket is really expensive, also his time is arranged and have no time to come backe to our hometown.
8.0	Therefore, my uncle is like a stranger for me.
8.0	However, in the past people are not so busy and few of them would go to distant places.
5.0	In addtion, people could seek help from another people easily and for  rapidly development of technology expand.
8.0	Because of the advanced technology, modern people could utilize the social application to find everything and everyone they want.
8.0	Years ago, my mother had a serious sickness, and she searched online with micro blog to find some doctors who can cure this illness, because the local doctors have no idea with this sickness, and finally there was a person recommended that the doctor he knew could cure this illness, and my mother become healthy with the help of the doctor.
8.0	Nevertheless, in the past people need to seek assistance from their extended family only, because their social network  were limited.
2.0	However, even though we are busier than people in the past, we still need to spend some time to company with them.
3.0	It is crucial for a group of members to have a leader, each company has its manager, each school has its headmaster, even a class in a kindergarden has its little monitor.
3.0	But when it comes to where and how does this personality of leadership come about?
3.0	Leadership comes natually or one can learn to be a leader?
3.0	Different peole have various ideas.
11.0	As for me, I think one can learn to be a leader.
5.0	First, not every leader is born a leader, leading a team of people is one kind of ability, which can be learnt and mastered.
8.0	We step into this world like a blank sheet, there are a lot of invisable elements for us to learn and absorb, leadership is one of them.
8.0	We witnessed our parents, relatives and teachers to lead a family, a campany or a class, that is what we do unconciously all the time, and by that, we gradually learn to act like a leader, then eventually, become a leader.
8.0	Myself for example, I used to be shy back in primary school, I evebn did not know how manage my time table clearly.
8.0	but I did see what my teacher did, he would devide the task into parts, and cut his time into each pieces in order to fit those task parts.
8.0	Which enlightened me that time managing can be done in this way, which is also a way of leading.
5.0	Second, leaders can be raised, through good ways and from a good guidance.
8.0	It is not hard to find that the ex-leader is always trying to find his successive one to inheritate his position, which has shown that leadership can be taught and passed upon.
8.0	Undoubted we could say Boston Celtics is one of the greatest teams in the field of sports, it has 16 NBA championships, and it has the best champion record-8 champions in a row!
8.0	Through all that 16 years, there are three leaders throughout that period, Albache, Russel and Haverich.
7.0	Albache is born a leader, he coached the team strictly and protected his players full-heartedly, while Russel at first was just a quiet, pre-game
3.0	Nowadats , an inclined numbers of parents are tend to make children doing wrong things and let them draugh from the mistakes they had made.
12.0	It has it's shortcoming and advantage .
12.0	Generally , i take the view that it may be a good way to solve the problem in the young generation growth .
8.0	In the positive hand , the mistake might be a landmarker in their lifes .
8.0	They will remember their faughts, Avoiding from happening again.
8.0	From the data of Times , In the vicinnity of 30 percent of children has made some big mistakes in their childhood ,And back to the time they had become a social-man  they will not do that again.
8.0	The children will be imaginative and creative , so they would have may thought in there heart that want to do .
8.0	some might be very antisocial and harmful.
8.0	So in order to shrink the cirme rate about the future society .
8.0	This way is sensible,because pupils can not make very deadly activities.
8.0	In my childhood , i want to be a friend of justice ,because of a anime called Fate Stay Night .
8.0	It might hard to interpreted by mature people .
8.0	But in the sight of pupil , they are affective , they can be affliate by anything .
8.0	So that leads to a way to making faught easily .
8.0	And they can draugh form it .
8.0	they can be galvanised and rejuvenate from the mistake they made , In another hand , if the way they are going is wrong.
8.0	The probility that they can not going back is existed .
8.0	Most parents can not manage their children strictly.

7.0	In order to chasing their young dreams
3.0	With the developement of the society, many things have changed, including young people make dicision.
11.0	In the past almost every family has more than one child, so parents can not consider all the children's mind evenly, which means young people in that time are more independent.
11.0	But today, young people can always get good care by their parents extremely and at last, they lack the ability of making decision.
12.0	Thus, I really disagree with the statement.
11.0	From my perspective, today's young people get too much help to make their own decison.
5.0	The help of parents in today's society cause young people rely on their parents rather than decide things by themselves.
8.0	I was the only girl in my family, so my parents always help to make the best decision, but actually they are wrong.
8.0	When I chose the university one year ago, I almost thought nothing but depended on my father a lot.
8.0	The ideas from my deep mind was that my father could help me choose the best school with my limited scores and what I needed to do was waiting my father's choice.
8.0	The fact was that I went to the best shcool but I lost my insterests, which means I did not like the subjects my father chose for me and what I did in school was playing everyday to kill the time.
8.0	Obviously, after I graduated, I  could not do nothing in the society and I waited my father to arrange job for me again.
8.0	Do you like this kind of life?
8.0	Are you willing to copy my boring life?
8.0	So why not try to become more independnt and take in charge of our own life by ourselves.
5.0	So what should we do to avoid become a dependent man?
8.0	If I try thought when I chose my own university rather than depend on my father, things will be totally different.
8.0	Thus, think more is a really effective way.
8.0	We should stop our parents when they are going to make decison for us and think by ourselves.
8.0	If I have an critical mind toward my father's decision, I will not become an unsuccessful girl afther I graduate.
8.0	Hence, please have the ability of critical thinking in our life.
0.0	All in all, today's young people more like to depend on their parents,because they the only one and the most important child in the home, which is opposite in the past, so they become more reliable on their parents.
0.0	What we should do is to think more and also have a kind of critical thinking ability toward parents' decison.
0.0	Thus, things will be different a lot and we can success at last.
12.0	Having a glimpse of today's world, we will often see some celebrities in the television doing some speeches or interviews.
12.0	Some people will think that their behavior and sayings are meaningful and beneficial.
12.0	However, this condition is not always  presented on all people.
12.0	Maybe it is more crucial to young people, or maybe it is more conducive to older people.
12.0	In my opinion, I prefer the former one.
6.0	To begin with, young people today are more willing to focus on celebrities.
8.0	When mention about fashion, we always know that more and more young people like to follow the trends.
8.0	And it is obliviouly that those older people have no interest in those stars.
8.0	Therefore, it is not likely that they will
3.0	Some parents offer their school-age children money when thet get high-marked in school, as a method of encouragement.
11.0	In my opinion, this is a workable way to give children dynamic on study.
12.0	This as well tells them that working hard and getting progress will be well paid, which has a positive effect in their later lives.
5.0	When I was a student of a primary school, my parents had also used this way to make me study.
9.0	If I got more than 98 of 100 scores in a course, I would be rewarded a toy as I wished, or some money that I could spend it myself while telling them where it had gone.
9.0	I have to admit that this had greatly encouraged me to study harder for a better grade.
5.0	However, each coin has two sides.
8.0	The biggest problem of this method is that while those school-age children get that money, how could we promise that they wouldn't use it to do those things of crime such as doing drugs?
8.0	As is known to all, children are hard to distinguish sins from cool things.
8.0	So I think that money should not be so much, and parents should monitor how their children use their money.
2.0	I support the idea of awarding children when they get high marks in school, but their parents should learn to control the whereabouts of money which they gave their children as rewards.
10.0	This could both encourage children of studying and tell them the importance of programming their money.
3.0	Because of the fast development of the society, nowadays people communicate less with their extended family members than they did in the past.
3.0	However, whenever asked about whether nowadays extended family is less important than it was in the past, people always exhibit an air of uncertainty.
12.0	Nevertheless, I wholeheartedly agree that extended family is less important now.
4.0	First, extended family is not as important as it was in the past because people now have better lives than people in the past did.
8.0	People in the past have few communication tools, so they know less people.
8.0	Moreover, they always have difficult conditions that they need help from others, which extended family members can be the only candidates willing to help.
8.0	In this way, people developed good relationships with extended familes.
8.0	However, now people seldom have problems that they can not solve by themselves because they now live happier lives.
8.0	So, they have less chance to meet and communicate with their extended families.
4.0	Then, extended family is less important because of the loss of traditions.
8.0	Peope in the past used to have a lot of traditions and rules, which were to visit or have dinner with their extended families, to follow especially when there was a festival around.
8.0	And these traditions and rules are very important for people in the past to follow.
8.0	Thus, people who do not follow them will be considered rude.
8.0	Nevertheless, with the development of the society, many of these traditions and rules have been lost.
8.0	In this way, many people don't even know these rules, not to mention follow them.
8.0	Therefore, people now have less contact with their extended families.
8.0	Then, they consider extended family less important.
4.0	Last but not the least, people nowadays are too busy to contact their extended families.
8.0	The competitions among people are very fierce, so people have to work hard to maintain their positions.
8.0	Moreover, they always have a lot of activities that they must attend when they are off from work.
8.0	Thus, they don't have much spare time to contact their extended families just to maintain the relationships that are not that necessary.
8.0	People now prefer to have more free time.
8.0	However, people have more free time in the past.
8.0	So visiting their extended families is more interesting to them.
8.0	In this way, extended family is less important now.
2.0	To conclude, extended family is less important now because people have better lives, less rules and less leisure time.
3.0	Assigning group projects is always seen as a effective way for students to study rather than letting students study alone.
3.0	However, it is not   widely used among the schools because it is pretty controversial to discuss.
12.0	As for me, I believe that it is not that idealist to for students to finish homework via working together.
4.0	To begin with, it is not euqually reviewing for every single individuals in the entire group.
8.0	When I was having this kind of work like presentation, there always a free-rider who is doing nothing in my team.
8.0	Then he will do nothing but lying aside watching us fighting with the heavy tasks exhausted.
8.0	Also he will never gat anything benefit to his study,such as knowing more about how to use what he has learned, obtaining the depper understanding of knowledege or something klike these.
8.0	Also.
8.0	the one who is making the powerpoint is not well-viewed about the point due to the work about the computer.
8.0	At last, the result is so awful that some of the students have fully control of the knowleges while some are not.
8.0	This kind of consequence is very irresponsible to the whole class.
4.0	What is more, the homework is  much time-consuming than work  alone.
8.0	When kids are disscussing about the homework, it is unavoidable to talk daily stuffs such as puppy love, party things or school news.
8.0	The point is that these topics are so easy to expand from just two people to the entire group, unfortunately the timing is flying while students are chatting without any noticing.
8.0	After a heated discussion, the only thing left is the realising that they are running out of time and regret.
8.0	Whlie dealing homework alone can almost fully delete the oppotunity to waste time like this due to the peace in mind when working without disturbing from others.
4.0	Last but not least, it may break the bond or wonderful relationship among students.
8.0	Admittedly, working in the form as a team is much more fun than work  alone admittedly; but students may have conflicts like holding opposite opinions or having different attitudes.
8.0	If I were on of the students in this situation, I may fighting with others even do somthing worse.
8.0	While  working individually will never trap me in this kind of hard situation forever.
8.0	Hence, doing homework alone is much better to maintain the  good relationship with others.
2.0	In a word, it is much better for kids to work alone individually than working with lassmates as a group for the three reasons stated.
3.0	Issues related to capabilities have never failed to attract people's attention.
3.0	When it comes to the leadership, recently a hotly debated topic has aroused among the public: whether the leadership can be learnt.
3.0	Some may insist that such kind of ability is determined by genes.
3.0	However, as far as I am conocerned, I belive that all of the people can learn the leadership from their living environment.
12.0	And my points of views will be illustrated as follows.
5.0	First of all, kids can learn leadership from their family members to become a leader.
8.0	To be specific, as a kid, his closest living surroundings are related to their family members.
8.0	And every family needs a host, a leader to make important decisions when facing problems to guide the whole family safely and healthily to bind together longer.
8.0	When the kids learn from the host's behavior like how to make decisions and how to satisfy everyone's desire that are  conponent of leadership, they can make good use of them to their own living conditions to become a leader.
8.0	For instance, what made me really impressed is that when I was a little boy, my grandpa host nearlly everything in my family.
8.0	Sometimes my uncle and my father had some conflicts, he would give the suggestion to help them to solve them and make the family complete.
8.0	After learning these, I always helped my classmates to deal with some problems and made sure that they could still be good friends.
8.0	And then my teacher found what I always did and chose me to be the monitor.
5.0	On top of that, even adults who have had jobs can still learn learship from their boss and then be promoted to become a leader.
8.0	In details, in most company, most of work need people to cooperate and each group has it own leader.
8.0	If a person who cannot lead others, he can be a group member and learn from the group leader about how to distribute the work, how to explore others' advantages, and how to make the final decision to ensure the acomplishment of the work efficiently and perfectly.
8.0	After learning these kind of abilities of guiding a group, next time when he is the group leader, he can use these method to guide others and become a good leader.
8.0	For example, my cousin used to be a person who will never ask others to finish something, which means that he could not be a leader.
8.0	However, after he got a job and leant a lot from his group leader, he can require others to finish some work in their expertise area, which not only made the job finish perfectly but also made him a good leader.
2.0	Finally, judging from all above, I strongly agree that people can leatn leadership to be a leader.
3.0	With the pressure of study growing nowadays, chlidren spend more time on doing homework or take part in organized activities related to schools or sports.
12.0	The trend may have its reasons, but I would suggest children be given more free time to allocate.
4.0	First, students will be more efficient if they are allowed to arrange some time on their own.
8.0	If more free time is given, they will cherish the time they have and try to find a well organized schedule.
8.0	In this way they will be more efficient.
8.0	In my middle school age my parrents didn't give me too much time to arrange freely, so I felt very dull and tired everyday, just solving problems repeatedly, and the acadamic performance didn't look well, either.
8.0	When I get into high school I lived home and have to arrange my time on my own, I got my own free time and my efficency promotes a lot and the acadamic performance also become better.
4.0	Second, given more time to the studnets enables their future potential.
8.0	Having free time will help students develop the skills they love, which the other may not have.
8.0	These skills provide opportunity for their future job.
8.0	Bill Gates spends a lot of time on computer programing when he was young.
8.0	These experience tend to be priceless when he started his own bussiness.
4.0	Although, doing homework or paticipate organized activites related to schools or sports may help students develop their basic learning skills, students can also develop there learning skills in their free times.
10.0	In their free time they have time to digest what they learned and find out a better way to have a good command of thier knowledge.
1.0	To sum up, give the students more time to learn will help them perform better at present or in the future.
1.0	So I am totally agree with the statement.
3.0	These days, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people: whether young people are more likely to invest their effort anfd time in improving the world today.
11.0	From my perspective, it is true that young people today are more likely to put their effort to improving the world.
5.0	Firstly, people have more vigor than before.
8.0	With the development of econimic, they pay attention to improving the quality of life instead of just concentrate on adequate and ample food and clothing.
8.0	Without the worry for eating fill, people turn the attention to improving the word, such as the environment quality, education fairness, and the medical level of the society.
8.0	For example, in the past, the dream of young people is just to solve the lack of basic living necessaries, paying all their time on the farming and various of part-time jobs.
8.0	However, with several statutary holidays, the young people today have plenty of spare time, Moreover, finishing their daliy tasks, they can use the time left to either research the social problems or take the volunteer jobs to put efforts to our society.
5.0	Secondly,young people get easily accesss to the porderance of social peoblems, they can learn mor e deeply about the society problems.
8.0	With the development of Internet, young people can get access to the information about our country even the world through the Internet.
8.0	Equipping with the quality education backgroud, plenty of students take the class called Contemporary Situation and Policy, which concern the problems.
8.0	Once young people knowed the occurance of some serious social peoblem, they would take the responbility as a citizen, thinking about the efficieny methods to solve it.
8.0	For example, esposed to the social problems, nearly einety-nine percent of students have the awareness of social peoblems, and sixty percent of students have taken the volunteer works to solve the problems in their holiday.
7.0	Even ten percent students choose to work as a
3.0	Nowadays,many students like work alone on projects.
3.0	However,some teacher think if assign project on which students must work together they will learn much more effectively than they work alone on project.
11.0	As far as I am concerned,this opinion is actually right.
11.0	There are some reason about this.
5.0	firstly,personal power is weak.
8.0	If we work together,many people can come up with the idea.
8.0	So,we can get more imformation about solution.
8.0	And then,we choose some good idea in this imformation.
8.0	I Believe We can get widely than someone who work alone.
5.0	Secondly,some students are really persistent with their opinion even they are wrong.
8.0	They never realize they are making mistakes.
8.0	If they work with others,they will be reminded from classmates.
8.0	And they also can help their classmates too.
8.0	It is a good interaction.
2.0	Not only workong in the school,this idea is also can be used in the international cooperation.
10.0	For
12.0	Recently, a heated debate have arisen from public: whether teachers should be paid at least as much as doctors, lawyers or business leaders are paid.
11.0	Some people claim that teachers should not get that much salary because they creat less values than other three occupations.
11.0	From my perspective, I think that teachers should get a higher salary than they do now.
12.0	My points will be elaborated as follows.
5.0	First, teacher is an occupation that can never be replaced.
8.0	We cannot deny the fact that we are all learned from teacher since we are in the kindergarden, so how could we draw such a conclusion that teachers should not be paid well even these words we uesd to describe our standpoint are taught by teachers.
8.0	Compared with teachers, the other three occupations we may not need to make connect with for a whole life.
8.0	And maybe that some kids nowadays can learn from the internet, but computers can never be as geniality and amiable as a real person in front of you.
8.0	For example, my nephew learned knowledge from the Internet, but I found that he did not like to talk to people around him, and my cousin took him to the hospital, the doctor said it is mainly because he wasn't learning at school, and the situation went better after he was taught by a really kind teacher.
5.0	Second, students are what we called the future of our country.
8.0	Education is always considered the priority of the policy of goverment, this is mainly because that students will grow up some day in the future and what they do will definitely decide whether they drive the country to prosperity or recession.
8.0	And it is teachers' duty to teach these young people how to build up their values, their outlook of life and their own concepts of the world, which will determine their personalities.
8.0	Take Qing dynasty for instance, in the late Qing dynasty, alot of famous people helped pur country during the war time.
1.0	To put in in a nutshell, I strongly believe that teachers should be paid at least as much as doctors, lawyers or business leaders are paid.
1.0	It is not only because teacher is an occupation that cannot be replaced, but also because students are the future of a country and they were taught by teachers.
11.0	With the development of humen society, there is a obvious tendency that  children are more likely to do more choices  than their parents such as select their school, their part-time job, and other selections.
11.0	Then how to chooes becomes a problem.
12.0	Should they do by themselves or search for help from their parents?
11.0	In my opnion, children should be allowed to do their own choice and learn to deal with the result.
5.0	First,as we know,a child will become an adult sooner or later.
8.0	It is necessary for them to do many choice in their lives.
8.0	So it is of a great significance for them to gain the ability to do some choice by thenselves.
8.0	If  Moreover,by making mistakes and learning from the mistakes, their ability to deal with problems can be enhauce vitally.
8.0	For example, when my uncle was young, his parents required him to arrage his schedule in daily life by himself.
8.0	At first, he felt very exciting to do outdoor activities he prefering so that he only finish the homework without reviewing knowledges.
8.0	Sometimes he even left the homework uncompeleted to playing.
8.0	At the final examination this term, he failed the math and got a lowsy judgement from his teacher, then his parents told him to correct the mistake, and he did konw the importance to get the studing time enough.
5.0	Adimtted, when parents help childen to do some choices, it is less likely to make mistakes with their experience.
10.0	But the choices doing by parents may out of date, the choices should be done only by the children themselves.
7.0	In a short, to do some choices ,make miastakes and coreect them,by this way
3.0	Do you know how to manage your own money?
3.0	And when do you form the thought of financially responsibility?
11.0	From my perspective, I really agree with the satement and children are supposed to manage their own money as youngh as they can.
5.0	During the yougn age, children will learn everything carefully and with a curious mind; thus, they can remenber the new things more deeply.
8.0	Liu Qiangdong, a Chinese entrepreneur of the JD company, is a typical example to support my point of view.
8.0	When he was a little boy, his parents always gave living costs to him for week and let him allocate his own money by himself.
8.0	Just because of this small action, he learned how to distribute money, deposit money and the responsibility of managing money.
8.0	When he growed up, he was a really financial responsible adults and have his own method to allot his money, including depositing some of it to the bank, investing some to the stock market and using a large amount of it to creat his own company finally.
8.0	He can become such a sucessful businessman due to the cultivation from his parents when his was young.
8.0	That is to say, yough age is the most essential age to develop chidren's responsibility of managing money and chidlren will remenber all those knowledge in their mind when they grow up.
8.0	Thus, children should learn to manage their own money at a young age.
5.0	When people grow up, because of the occupation of high pressure from both work and study, it is too late to develop this ability.
8.0	Take mysely, a gril without any financial responsibility, as an instance to illustrate my own perspective.
8.0	Because of the large amount assignment given by my teacher and peer pressure from my classmates, including the competition in exam, comparison on grades and so on, I hardly have time to care about how to manage my own money.
8.0	Obviously, after I grow up, I even not not know the meaning of financial responsibility, let alone the manage products to earn money myself.
8.0	What I do as an adult is just rely on by parents' suggestion and do what they ask me to do.
8.0	Because of the busy work, I ignore to form the financial ability and become a lonely girl in the middle of the society.
0.0	In summary, children are required to manage their own money at a young stage to become financial responsible.
0.0	That is because, young age is the best period to learn and develop new thoughts, chidlren will never forget the ability and become more and more proficient.
0.0	In addition, young age is the most spare time because the high work stress when people grow up and they do not have the time to learn new things, which means when they realize they need to learn, it is just too late.
3.0	In the fast-paced society with advanced techology, how to educate children  always become a crucial topic among the public.
12.0	Some people believe that it is inneccessary for them to understand how to control their children  and let them do what they want to, even they know their kids will  make mistakes.
12.0	Conversely, some people hold the opposite view that parents should take care of their children and set family rules.
11.0	In my opinion, I agree with the latter one.
5.0	Admittedly, some children which have received high-quality education have the ability to learn from mistakes and personal experience actually is  much more impressive for children compared to teach them how to behave.
8.0	What's more , this method will likely play a cricial role in future carreer.
8.0	For example, the reason why Steve jobs succeed is he learn from mistakes.
8.0	As a successful leader,  due to thinking differently, he makes his product become more famous.
8.0	When people selling their own product, they always act like this, spend much time to inreoduce what product he wil sell and how products are made.
8.0	They barely spend time to discuss why they design this product and their belief.
8.0	However, Steve jobs succedding in this.
8.0	He thinks the belief and purpose of a product is important.
8.0	This is the result of learning from mistake.
5.0	However, in fact, things are not always going well.
8.0	Since most children are too young to  equip themselves with enough knowlege and skills that are neccessary to learn from mistake, they can get nothing or cultivate some bad habit if children cannot realize they have made mistake.
8.0	For example, when  i was a child, my elder brother alwas lost things ,such as , umbrella, pencils, pems, or MP3.
8.0	But my parents ignore the improtance of educating him because they think he will learn to  be careful next time.
8.0	Nevertheless,  he was not able to realize the value of possessions, and since he was seldom punished , gradually he develop a bad habit .
2.0	In conclusion, although some children can learn from their mistakes, mosh children cannot benifit from them.
12.0	The recent years has witnessed a obviously tendency that people's health are playing a more and more important part in human's life.
12.0	Because of this change, It is not uncommon to see that people always taking about how to improve their health.
8.0	As we know, physical exercise is the most effective way to help people keep their health.
8.0	Some people support the former as old people need more physical exercise, but the other are in favor of the latter because young children are still grow.
8.0	As for me I think physical exercise is more important for young children.
4.0	First, as some people said, young children are still grow, they need enough physical exercise to develop their body, it can help them become more strong.
9.0	A strong body is a necessary part of advantages when someone enter the society and find jobs.
9.0	So physical exercise is the fundamantal things that a young people should do.
4.0	On the other hand, through do some physical exercise in the gym or the playground, they can do exercise with other people, they can make more friends and inprove their communication abilities, those also are the critical part of skills and resource in their future life.
4.0	But if young people lack of physical exercise, it will influence their physical health.
9.0	And worse, it could lead to sickness when they are just teenagers.
9.0	It can make them always feel overwhelmed in their future work.
1.0	Because of those reason, in my opinion, I think physical exercise is more important for young people than old people, because it is not only a way to keep their life more longer, but also can develop their skills and advantages which is essential in their future.
1.0	So I'd recommended that the young children should do more and more physical exercise in their daily life, to increase themselves.
3.0	Nowadays, many parents offer their children money for each high grade they get in school.
3.0	Different people have different opinions on it.
12.0	Some may think it is a very good idea because it can encourage their children to work harder to get a higher grade, while others think it will make children even more pressure.
4.0	There are many advantages to do this.
8.0	Some parents think if you give your children some awards when the did a good job, children will establish the awareness that working hard and getting a good grade will be rewarded.
8.0	On the other hand, if they did work hardly enough, they will be punished, which means they will not have pocket money to buy some snacks or toys.
8.0	It will not only encourage their school-age children to work harder, but also give them an good oppotunities to make good use of their pocket money.
4.0	However, many people argue that young children should be more naive and pure, they are not supposed to materialistic.
10.0	If they made a little mistake and did not get a very ideal grade,they will be extremely sorry for not getting a reward given from parents.
4.0	As far as I am concerned, I do not think it is a very good idea to offer school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.
8.0	I think it is too early for them to know the cruelty of adults' world.
8.0	They will simply connect their little success with money.
8.0	They will be more likely to be materialistic and lose their purety.
8.0	Plus, it will be more likely for them to get very nervous before taking a test, which does no good for them to get a good grade.
0.0	In a word, I do not think offering money is good idea, maybe we can try some other reward for children when they get a good grade.
0.0	Such as take a trip or have a big meal.
0.0	I think the farther children get away from money, the happier and more innocent they will become.
3.0	There has been a phenomenon that the chirdren who study in school are awarded money whenever they get high grade.
3.0	This method used by parents obviously aims to encourage their chirdren to study harder.
11.0	It seems useful ,but I do not believe that it is a good idea.
5.0	On the one hand, to some extent, this behavior of awarding money may make vhildren think highly of money instead of the knowledge they have learned,which goes againet the aim of studying.
8.0	Awarding  them is necessary when they get good grade, because it is a signal that indicate studying well is what they should try their best to do.
8.0	And it is important to encourage them to pay more attention to their study.
8.0	However, what they are awareded should be a book they admire to read or a chance to see films with friends.
8.0	It may be better.
5.0	On the other hand, it may increase the burden of family finance.
10.0	If the money was not used to award the children, more money would be used to improve the quality of the family.
2.0	what is more, as for children, they are too young to have a plan of using money.
7.0	It is not a good idea for them to
3.0	It seems very attractive to a teenager that they can follow their hearts and  choose whatever job they want.
11.0	While as far as  my opnion,students who is undergraduate seldomly have adequate social experience and when they are facing the moment   of choosing jobs,they may be not as reasonable as they thought  to be.
11.0	And do wht their parents do is a more safty and wise choice.
12.0	TO begin with ,following their prarents steps,they can the the short path to the success.
8.0	Take myself as an example,my mother is a teacher,when I graduated from university,i choose this job directly.
8.0	My mother told me a lot of teaching experience,and when I attend the teaching competition of the school I work at,I get the highest reward.
8.0	This is not surprising, for my mother have introduce me the teaching skilling accumulated in 20 years of her working experience.
5.0	Secondly,it wll improve the development the realm you will work at.
8.0	We know that continus experience is valuable for a skill and tecnniqu.
8.0	Take Japan as an exmple,this country's handcraft and cooking is outstanding in the world.
8.0	Because there are lots of companies and restaurants which exist more thatn hundreds of years,whihc inherited generation by gerneration.
8.0	If people learn and develope their parents' unique technique,and take this as his or her career ,they can make it into extremly outstanding conditions.
5.0	Thirdly,we can get the matreials of person relationships from your parents.
8.0	Take myself as an example again.
8.0	When I graduate from university and want to be a teacher,no school want to hire me for I do not have any teaching experience before,for students' sake, they will never hire a person to teach without any working experience.
8.0	While the chairman of the teacher commtitee of that school is one of my mother's friend.
8.0	After my mother give her a call, I get the offer of that school.
1.0	Through what I have said above , working experence from your parents will lead your way;continuous skill developement is valuable;relationship material from your parents can clean the obstacles to your jobs.
1.0	Take what your parents' jobs as your job,it will give you a brilliant future.
3.0	Now, we have many ways to relax.
12.0	Everyone has their own ways, For examples, watching a movie, listening a song, reading a book, doing physical exercise.
11.0	someone think watching movie is the better than doing physical exercise.
11.0	But for me,the best way to relax is doing physical exercise.
4.0	To start with, watch movie is make things worse sometimes.
9.0	When you broken up with someone you like, and you went to cinema, watch the romatic movie, you were upset absolutely.
9.0	Another part is, when you stayed a sealed room long times, your brain were started hurt, make you uncomfortable.
4.0	Second one is reading book, i don't think this is a wonderful way to relax.
10.0	because when you reading book long time, your eyes will indistinct, cuase you can't reading clearly, even make you anxious.
4.0	Finally, doing physical exercise can make you health.
9.0	Also when you doing it, you can start to consider the problem that you met, becuase when you in physical exercise, your brian will very clearly.
9.0	After you finish the exercise, you were felt relax and comfortable, the problem also be soluted.
2.0	In conclusion, the best way to relax is doing physical exercise.
12.0	Education plays an essential role in a child's development .
8.0	If a kid gains a good education when he was young, it is easy for him to get success.
8.0	For a along time, people have been searched for the way to educate their children, and some people find that it's more difficult to educate children than it was because our children spend much time on phone ,computer games and networking web site.
8.0	But in my opinion, I think these things don't effect children and even they can educate children better.
6.0	First of all, children can expand knowledge from the Internet.
8.0	With the development of Internet, people can learn more news at any time by Internet and it provides another way for children to observe th world.
8.0	For explem, if a kid wants to see many plants which don't grow in his city, he can use Internet to search for them.
8.0	In the website, he has known the shape ,color ,and feature of the plants.
8.0	So, it helps children open up their  mind they can get a glimpse of those great minds and understand the world better.
11.0	I agree that it is a better way to relax ourselves by watching a movie or reading a book than by doing physical exercise.
12.0	Because when it comes to the topic about relaxing,i think nothing is better than to have an amusemant like  watching a movie with your friends or  read a book you really like.
11.0	When we watch movies,we may not have to spend too much time to think about something,what we need to do is completely enjoying ourselves.
10.0	You can go with the plot that the movie proceed,and to smile or laugh naturally when it was at the comic point.
5.0	Whereas,it would be a very problem when you plan to do physical exercise.
8.0	You need to be very catious and serious,and also need to think about what is the next step and will it be right?
8.0	Maybe you also have to caculate many number's plus,even square in your mind.
8.0	That's actually a boring and unhappy thing for most of us.
5.0	Nevertheless,there are also a few people around us who are passionate in scientific research,and they like doing physical exercise very much,and  care every report relates to technology as well.
8.0	For these people,doing physical exercise maybe the happiset thing in their daily life.
8.0	They enjoy the progress even they strive too much for suceeding in it.
8.0	But the pleasure they finally discover the mystry gives a sense of proud to them.
8.0	However,it only a minority of us who like those people.
8.0	So,generally,we most peole may prefer to watching a movie or readding a book to relax.
8.0	Reading a book can complementary our knowledge of traditonal culture,society,the skills to communicate with others better.
8.0	That's very useful,and we apply what have learned from the books to our real life ,and that may help us live a better life.
3.0	Recently, a controvesial topic has aroused a heated debate among the students:whether people will spend less time on cooking and preparing foods in future twenty years than nowadays.
3.0	Opinoins vary from person to person.
3.0	Some people hold the view that people will spend more time on it for he thinks people will spend less time on working and can spend more time on cooking.
3.0	Contrast to the view is my perspective that there will be less time that people spend on cooking and preparing fooods in twenty years.
12.0	My point can elabrated as follows.
5.0	First, the future science will help people save the time of some steps of  cooking and preparing foods.
8.0	As we all know, compared with the time twenty years ago, we spend less time on preparing foods because we can just order all the vegetables meats on the Internet and do not need to go out.
8.0	So we can imagine from this, there will more devices that can help us with cooking and preparing for foods.
8.0	Finally, we will spend less time on it.
8.0	For example, there is a industry which can cook all by itself.
8.0	All you need to do is adding all the material into the case and pushing the botton.
8.0	After 20 minutes, you can eat it.
8.0	Although this creation is not that perfect and always caues lots of problems, we can speculate that there will be a better one which can help us cook and we will spend less time on cooking.
5.0	Second, in recent few years, the speed of life has been increasing.
8.0	And we can make the conclusion that the speed of life in twenty years can even become faster than the speed of life nowadays.
8.0	As we all know, as the developing of the society, there are more work people need to finish and more problems people need to face.
8.0	So the people may just have a short break when the lunch time comes.
8.0	With the limitation of the time, most of the people may not have the ability to spend time to cooking and preparing all by themselves.
8.0	Finally, most of them choose to eat out.
8.0	So we can imagine, if the speed of life can be still that fast, people will also not have time to cook and prepare foods.
2.0	In conclusion, i do think that people will spend less time cooking and preparing for food in next 20 y
11.0	Nowadays, many people think that more money should be given to the university to improve the education quality.
11.0	However, there are many aspects of certain university to make it.
11.0	It is a difficult problem to decide which area to invast in.
11.0	Invasting in a right area can improve the education best.
11.0	In  my opinion, the university should spend the money on professors salaries.
5.0	First, with higher income, professors may be more willing to teach well.
8.0	People are more likely to work hard if they are rewarded better.
8.0	It is possible that the salaries can strengthen the sense of responsebility, of which may teach more knowledge in each lesson and spend more time after class to solve students' question.
8.0	Then students will understand the terms better and get higher grade in the exams.
8.0	Seeing that their own students perform well, a sense of achievement and self-fulfillment can be gain by professors, which encourages them to impart the knowledge in their head even better.
8.0	The education quality can be greatly improved.
5.0	Furthermore, professor can have more money to buy experiment equipments and do their own researches.
8.0	It is a good way for them to improve themselves and attach to advanced techniques, which means students can have greater chance to absorb this new knowledge.
8.0	It is even possible that they can be involved in the researches if their professor allows.
8.0	Then the students are more likely to succeed becauce of the involvement of the research and the practicing skill of experiments, which may improve the fame of the university.
8.0	And the university can probably absorb more talented professors, which improve the education quality.
1.0	In conclusion, the university should spend more money to higher the salaries of the professors.
1.0	It is the best and most efficient way to improve quality of education.
3.0	Nowadays,people take their attention to social or political gradually.
11.0	Some people think that teacher should make their viewsknown to the students, and others think teacher should not.
11.0	In my opinion, I concerned that teacher should not make their social or politial known to students.
11.0	There are some reasons to support my opinion.
5.0	In the first place, I argue that some teacher have private opinions for the social or politial; If teacher talk about these questions to students  who do not hve their own opinion,which will lead students make a mistake that the students will think the teachers' persepective is correct, because all of us know, teacher have a huge influence for students, when students in school, they think teachers' word are always correct, so,when teachers talk social or political for the students ,which can disturb students judgement.
5.0	Secondly, when peoplo grow, which need face lot of question.
9.0	In other word, everyone need have their own experience.
9.0	For example, when I study in university, I need solve many problem,,such commucicate with professor or director.
7.0	Last once, I remember I need to ask some acedemic questioto
7.0	I agree with this following statement because of 2 points.
5.0	The first point is every people will make mistakes in the world, they can't avoid mistakes.
8.0	Parents may avoid their children make mistakes when they are young, but parents can't avoid all of their chidrens' mistakes in their whole life, their children will leave them in one day, so they need to now how to solve the mistakes, but if they don't know how to solve the mistakes, that's will be the biggest problem.
8.0	So children make mistakes is also a very important class in their life, when they make mistakes, they can learn how to solb=ve this peoblem and know how to avoid it, so parents need let their children make mistakes nad teach them how to solve it, but if they just tell their children how solve the mistakes, it will be no helpful because their children will not remember it, they think that they don't make mistakes so why should they learn how to solve it.
8.0	That's why let children make mistakes is important.
5.0	After that, i'd like to say nobody is perfect.
10.0	Nowadays, more and more people become rich and rich, they pay more attention on their children than before, but too much love for their children is also not good, many children children make mistakes but they require their parents to fisx the mistakes, and some parents really do this because in their opinion, nothing is important than their children, so they solve the mistakes insteatd of their children, this action is not good for their children, it will enable their children become very arrogance, but children need to know the crueltly of the world, when they grow up, they make mistakes, their parents can't fix it, the mistakes become a big problem but they can't solve it, it will be the disaster in their life.
2.0	"All in all, children make mistakes is good for their future life and parents need to know how to deal with their mistakes, the best way is teach them how to solve it rather than solve it instead of their children, because ""don't take evil for granted""."
11.0	I don't agree with the statement that watching a movie or reading a book it's better than doing physical exercise when relaxing.
11.0	From my perspective, experiensing spiritual amusement such as watching movies and reading books is quite different from doing physical exercises which is mainly a physical entertainment.
12.0	These two different ways of relaxing oneself both has its own unique advantages.
5.0	On the one hand, Watching movies or reading books does not require much skills.
8.0	People simply sit and enjoy through the works made by others.
8.0	It's not exhausting when people reading or watching.
8.0	And it doesn't require a specific place to do it.
8.0	Just a chair in a room is all it needs.
5.0	On the other hand, doing physical excercise brings another experience.
9.0	By focusing on the exercise itself, our minds which were occupied by works or study will be refresh.
9.0	In addition, doing physical exercise can ensure us a healthy,energetic body,which is important for a healthy and happy life.
2.0	In a word, different forms of relaxing have unique advantages that various from one to another.
10.0	It's always a better stradegy to try out different ways of relaxing than stict on only one way.
3.0	Nowadays, some parents always offer their school-age children money for the high grade they get.
11.0	Some people think it is not good for the students, but i think there are some benefits.
4.0	First, giving children money for their high grade can be a kind of couragement for the kids.
8.0	When they know they get get some reward, they probably will work hard for their next high grade.
8.0	For example, when i was in middle school, my parents tell me if i can get a high grade in my final exam,i can get some reward as my extra pocket money.
8.0	So i begin to pay more attention on my study and hope to get a good grade.
8.0	I begin to do exercise and review my notes.
8.0	Finally i get a high grade and the money.
8.0	After that, i know if i study harder, i can get some prises like money.
8.0	Then i often tri my best in every exam.
4.0	second, gettind the money can be a goal for the children.
8.0	It also can teach younf kids to try their best to reach their goal.
8.0	Some children don't actually know what they want to get and the meaning they fight for.
8.0	When the parents offer thekids money for their good grade, it can be a much more clearly goal than the things in the future.
4.0	Last, i think offering money to the school-age students sometimes also have some bad effects like spending too much care ob the money.
8.0	At the school-age like primary school, it may be too early for kids to earn money.
8.0	Some children may take the money as the most important part in his daily life.
8.0	When the money play the most important role in kids' life, they mey only try hard for the money.
8.0	It's not positive for the young kids.
2.0	All in all, i think parents offer the school-age children money for the high score they get is a good idea, it can truly help them a lot on their study.
3.0	As the time fleeting, the soceity has changed dramatically in every single year.
3.0	There is so much great differences between generations and generations.
3.0	In another word, the ways of gathering information and making decisions are updating all the time.
11.0	In my opinion, today young people are better able to make decisions about their own lives.
5.0	Initially, young poeple can use advanced technology to make desicions.
8.0	Nowadays, Opening the website and typing the keywords, People can easily gather the information they want.
8.0	Moreover, there is so many diverse application existing in our smart phone.
8.0	For example, Uber can help people call for a car anywhere and anytime; Ebay can seach the products which people want to buy; Google map can serve as a moving GPS.
8.0	Young people can make many decisions on a tiny smart phone.
8.0	Compare to the past time, young people only can make decisions by limited media such as newspaper and the verbal communication.
5.0	Admittedly, the parents have experience to help youngesters make decisions.
8.0	In fact, the experience is outdated and limited.
8.0	Once, My parents did not agree on the decisions that I made, since I want to be a graphic designer in the future.
8.0	They misled that the deisign was only for traditional media like newspaper or magezines.
8.0	Thus, I spent a lot time and energy to persuade them by showing the documentaries and searching information on the internet.
7.0	As the development of  careers,  the parents may have misunderstanding towards many thing that young peop
3.0	Recently, many people are debating about a hot topic: whether people today are more willing to help the struggling strangers?
11.0	Some people believe that it is true,while others hold a different opinion.
5.0	On one hand, as science and technology develope, though we can contact anyone whenever and wherever we want as long a there is a signal station, mentally, people are getting actually more distant.
8.0	we are getting more and more indifferent to various SMSs and calls even to people we know.
8.0	Moreover, fraudsters today are coming up with all kinds of ways to take advantage of the goodness of kind people.
8.0	For example, nowadays some old people pretend to fall down by the side of the roads, when innocent people come by and offer them a hand, these old people would claim that it was the  innocent passerby that pushed him, thus blackmailing money from the innocent person.
8.0	If you take a glance at the newspapers, you will find that things like this happen everyday.
8.0	Be afraid of beimg set up and takimg all the potential risks into consideration, people today wolud hesitate if they are to help the struggling strangers.
5.0	One the other hand, a lot of people hold the opinion that people today are actually more willing to help the struggling strangers.
8.0	They believe that people are born with senses and emotions, we can relate when we see others suffering because of empathy.
8.0	And we are taught from our childhood to be nice to other people.
8.0	We should not stand idle when we see struggling strangers.
8.0	Instead, we should do as much as we can to help them.
1.0	As far as I am concerned, the number of fraudsters is indeed increasing very fast, and their tricks are becoming more and more various and difficult to tell, so we should stay vigilant when we are to offer help to strangers.
1.0	But, at the same time, laws and rules against these tricks are getting imprved day by day, and I am pretty optimistic about it ,so I think people today are more willing ti
3.0	Some parents think it is of course to children some promotion ,motivation,and starting point is good,parents use money as an important means to education their children,but tje more important is to let children know that making money is not easy,encourage them to earn returns,that is understandable.
10.0	Reward the children money is only a kind of auxiliary of education,children have psychological needs,meet the needs,can be a hug,a small gift,the same can achieve the good result.
3.0	Nowadays, parents are always ruined with the work and that makes them unable to take care of their children.
12.0	So, I think if there is a little time for them to spend with their kids, they would better play games or sports.
5.0	Although some people would consider that children need their parents' help on the schoolwork and students may make progress with full use of time, parents cannot contribute much on their children's assignments.
8.0	Teachers are the ones who can actually help students out of schoolwork trouble, because they know what the kids are learning and where they may find difficulties.
8.0	At that time, teachers are able to give a properer solution than the parents.
8.0	For example, once I had an English problem, then I chose to ask my mother for help, we spent a great time solving it, but we ended up with failure.
8.0	At last, my teacher gave me a hand.
8.0	That is to say, there is no need for parents to take extra time to support their kids on their homework for there are teachers as well.
8.0	So, why not have fun with kids instead of wasting time on the schoolwork.
5.0	First, children need their parents love which can be perfectly expressed during pleasant time like playing games or sports.
8.0	Children are always busy with their assignments both at school and home.
8.0	When they are under pressure, there is no appropriate way for them to relax.
8.0	When their parents have time to be with them, they would absolutely not like to do schoolwork with parents but playing.
8.0	For today's students, there are not enough time for them to relax and get away from the work.
8.0	So, when there is a little time for parents, the first thing they should do is to help their kids forget the annoyance.
8.0	As a result, children may feel love from parents and grow up happlier.
0.0	Furthermore, games and sports can equip their kids with strong bodies.
0.0	Because they are busy with homework, students have little time to do exericises.
0.0	When doing that, they can be more healthier.
3.0	Issues related to selecting courses have never failed attract people' s attention.
3.0	Recently, a heated debated topic arose in the public: whether all university students should be required to take history courses whatever their field of study is or not.
12.0	Opinions vary from one to another.
11.0	Some people believe that history courses are significant to students so all of them have to take this.
12.0	However, in the ultimate analysis, I contend that it is not necessary for all students to take history courses, as students who take other courses will not use the knowledge of history.
12.0	My points can be illusrated as follow.
5.0	To begin with, if students are majoy in other courses, studying history courses will press pressure on them.
8.0	To be more specific, when students take history courses, since they are not specialized in history, they at most know the basic knowledge of history.
8.0	They have to prepare lots of work in order to perform well in history courses, such as collecting information about history, asking advanced students or professors for help, remembering certain time point of crucial events and so on.
8.0	It will be lots of work for them to do, which means these students have to spend much time and energy.
8.0	It is more possible for them to study history courses in their leisure time, so they do not have too much time to relax.
8.0	It is more likely for them to feel tired.
8.0	Also, it is hard for students who do not majoy in history to do as well as those who specialize in history.
8.0	Thus, when they take courses together, the students who majoy in other courses must feel upset and become stressful.
5.0	In the second place, it is a waste of time for students who are in other field of study.
8.0	As the knowledge of history have almost nothing to do with information of other subjects.
8.0	Therefore, even these students study well and gain lots of knowledge about history, the knowlege is useless for them.
8.0	So, the time these students spend in learning history should be regarded as waste.
8.0	Take my sister as an example, when she was in college, she was speciallized in English.
8.0	However, the school required all students in that university to take history courses.
8.0	But she thought nothing she studies from the history lessons could be used in English, as these two subjects did not relate at all.
7.0	She spent two hours each day to lear
3.0	Nowadays,some people believe that young people are more likely to be with their friend and family,because they are full of energy and enthusiasm.
3.0	Thus,there is no doubt that young people are possible to have more chance to meet or help others.
3.0	Howerer,other people says young people do not give enough time to helping their coummunities with the rapid develpoment of technology and society.
3.0	Which opinion do you agree?
11.0	In my opinion,I firmly believe the latter one.
10.0	The reasons are as follows.
5.0	First of all,there are less and less communication between young people and communities.
8.0	For the widespread use of technology such as mobile phones,computers and so on,most of the young people are addicted to computer games.
8.0	They tend to be inactive and unwilling to talk with others even their close friends or parents.
8.0	Take my cousin as an example,he used to be such an active and outgoing student and always took part in various competitions and activities.
8.0	What's more, he is so helpful that always tried his best yo help others.
8.0	Somehow,he was crazy about computer games.
8.0	The only thing he wanted to do was playing games in his bedroom all day.
8.0	Thus,he even did not have other time to talk with others.
5.0	Second,young people are faced with great pressure from society.
10.0	We a
3.0	It's universally ackknowledged that cell phones, networking, online games, annd other elctronic devices play the important role of education on the present day.
3.0	In my opinion, I disagree the satement that nowdays educating children is more difficult task today that it was in the past becuse the cell phones, online games.
11.0	However, I think it advanced force the children grow up easier.
5.0	First of all, compared  the past, the cell phones enabled help children to study or educate them.
8.0	Fortunately, nowday it has already got the advenced tecnology of cell phones, and children can download some softwares to help them study, students find not difficult to study on the cell phones.
8.0	For instance, in the past, children need to used the paper text and dictionary to learned the English, and without the audion pronounciation.
8.0	So, they didn't know how to pronounce correctly.
8.0	At present, children can use the softwares on the cell phone that can quickly serch out the words or sentence that need to learn and they can imitate the audio text to fix their false pronounciation.
8.0	As a result, more and more childeren be affected positively and allow them can speak as fluent as you cannot imagine.
5.0	Secondly, children is eaiser to gain obvious benefit on the online games, which cultivate the children's ability of cooperation and communication cannot be ignored, it's an important of the children's growing.
8.0	For example,  children in  the past, they were hard to communicate with others becuase it's lace of a medium.
8.0	They only study by lonely, just focus on the paper, further, they didn't  have any various activity to enjoy.
8.0	Nowdays,  children can play the online games and have to konw the theme of teamwork.
8.0	They need understand whatever they are good at, it's better arrange the team's position.
8.0	It really increases children's sense of teamwork.
10.0	In conclusion, educating children
11.0	"To be honest, I can't agree with this opinion that ""People today are more willing to help the struggling strangers""."
12.0	As we all know, nearly the bad things happened one by one, just like, Xue's litigation, the struggling between some people on the net.
12.0	Sounds like with the Global warming, the relation ship between humans are also hot.
11.0	But unluckily, when these things happen, people more likely to see what happened and stand out, don't care about how to solve this thing.
11.0	These outlookers is the symbol of our society, that's means, we like to wacth, to listen, to join it fun, but we didn't put help.
4.0	We also see these things happening, a girl walking on the street and be abducted and trifficed.a lot of people see and discuss, but nobody help, they only wacth.
8.0	"Mr.Zhou used says that: ""Human's heart is not beuty as the ancient's."""
8.0	And to some extent, I agree this statement.
8.0	"In the Chinese culture, there are so many idiom like ""considerated and warmhearted"", ""The road was unevenly supported""."
8.0	But now, what we have?
8.0	The whole day we can see is obsulutely apathy, People don;t care about anyothers, they only care themselves.
4.0	"So how can anybody say""People today are more willing to help the struggling strangers""?"
10.0	What they really willing is to say what happening and make it to the funny things when talking about.
4.0	From the Xiao YueYue's things, to the bride in the Beijing film university; from the struggling of strangers, to the struggling of closer person.
8.0	Human are more and more likely to care about what they can gain and what they should pay, but not what is right and what is false.
8.0	"There is an old saying that ""Kids are talking about right and wrong, adult are talking about benefit."""
8.0	That's not right, I don't know why, and don't know how to solve it.
2.0	The only thing I know is, really, people today are not more willing to help the struggling strangers.
3.0	Due to the comparison phenomenon between the parents,or high expectation for next generation's development,all the parents want thier children can achieve a high grade,but some of them use inappropriate methods to motivate their children.
3.0	For instance,once children get high grade in school,parents will give them money for award.
11.0	I don't think it's effective and worthy to do so.
12.0	Here are my reasons.
5.0	First of all,children maybe become greedier after getting money again and again.
8.0	I remenber when I was in primary school,I got NO.3 in a test,so I asked my parents for 10 yuan to buy some snacks as award.
8.0	Several days later,I get NO.1 in another test.
8.0	This time I was so proud,therefore,I asked for 20 yuan.
8.0	AIthough my parents agreed at that time.
8.0	But when I recall this memory,I think it's such a bad behavior which made me greedy.
5.0	What's more,children will build up an opinion that they should compete everything with others at such a young age.
9.0	As the time going,they can't feel happy or satisfied once they don't get high enough grade.
9.0	They lose their childishness in face of fierce competition,learning to be cold-hearted.
1.0	Last but not least,children will form an incorrect opinion that money can handle many problems,instead of their own efforts,just like their parents,who give them money for higher grade.
1.0	Once I saw a young girl said I ill give you money  In summary,It's not a good idea for some parents to offer money when their children get high marks in school.
3.0	Nowaday, with the deveploment of econmic,people don not need to focus on their life, so they put more and more attention on education.
11.0	In the growing stage, it is important that parents need to show the good way to do something.
12.0	From parents side, they don't their children failure, so it is important that parents guide their children to fix their mistakes, and I totally agree with this suggestion.
4.0	First, it is important to have a experience about failure.
8.0	Let urs make a example, in the daily life, ther are many kinds of teacher or guider, they will tell many good ways to fix problems when you are facing different issue.
8.0	But there is a circumtance we always face.
8.0	when you are facing some emergency, your brain is very nervous, you can't memorize the method immediatly.
8.0	Or the method will not always suitable for you.
8.0	However if you have a experience that about failure, you have real feeling, and you will have your own way which is appropriate to you.
8.0	Next you face it, your can fix it more easily.
4.0	Second,it is necessary that children need to face their mistake.
8.0	In today's society, many parents don not want their children get any hurts, so they protect them too much, so much so that they lose ability to deal with problems by themselves when they grow up.
8.0	When they are kid, it is a improtant stage.
8.0	They can start with small defeat that they can affort the mistake, and they will find way to deal with the bad mood, and learn from it.
8.0	I thinl it is what the growing mean.
4.0	Finally, in dictionary the word-education mean trainning and learning.
8.0	In my opinion, making a mistake is usual.
8.0	In China, there is a famous sentence which is collect by success person in his life-- Success's origin is failure.
8.0	Making mistakes cannot be aviod.
10.0	Parents should let shilfren make mistakes is nec
8.0	Nowadays, more and more parents require their children to study hard in stead of ask them to relate well to people.
8.0	It seems reasonable.
8.0	In my senior high school, almost everyone spare no effort to study, and have no time to think how to relate well to someone.
8.0	Is the ability to relate well to people more important than studying hard in school?
8.0	I think it is definitely right.
8.0	Relating well to people not only can make us own more friends, but also offer more chances.
6.0	First of all, Relating well to people can make us own abroader social networks.
8.0	It is obvious that someone who is good at relating will have more freinds than those who only focus on study.
8.0	On the contrary, a  person who only study hard will lose much resource.
8.0	Take my classmates as an example, Bob is a positive boy, and he likes playing basketball, discussing problems with teacher.
8.0	Everyone in my class likes him.
7.0	Another classmate, Elton is a
3.0	Do you think you have the ability to become a leader?
3.0	Do you think you are a nature leader?
11.0	For this point I think leadership can be learned.
11.0	This is because, a lot of very important virtue have to be learn during our lifetime and no one can gain these abilities which belong to the leader without learning and study.
11.0	So I disagree with the opinion that leadership cannot be learn.
6.0	In fact some great man such as the Linkan who may naturlly have some ability to lead other.
8.0	Lincan is the best student in his class and he always had more friends than others so in the future he had very big adventage during his prolific career.
8.0	By this way he also made very great contribution to USA and let the USA went to fair and free.
8.0	But even he was so talent, during his childrenhood, once he had a fight with others because this boy stolen his wood.
8.0	Little Linkan felt very angry but his mother tought him that the reason why the boy stolen his wood was this boy did not have ability to obtain so many woods just like the Linkan.
8.0	When little Linkan know that, he decided to teach the boy how to cut the wood more efficiently.
8.0	Forturnately, the boy did not steal his wood and they became very good friends.
8.0	By this story I think may be the talent mind and outstanding ability of Linkan came naturally but the methods how to deal with the relationship with others came from his mother.
8.0	So if Linkan would not have a mother tought a lot of things to him, he would not be the president of the USA.
1.0	Moreover the leadership comes from the naturally is not enough and we must learn other virtue of the leader.
1.0	People could be very talent and have the talent in speaking but if he does not learn how to toleranc
3.0	In this day and age, with the remarkable progress of our society development, a heated discussion has aroused attention among us: If people will spend less time cooking and preparing food in 20 years than they do today.
3.0	Answers vary from one person to another.
3.0	Some claim that it is good for us to prepare food step by step, while others deem that cooking in 20 years must be faster than today.
12.0	Contrary to their views comes my perspective that we will spend less time preparing foods in twenty years.
5.0	To begin with, the development of technology in twenty years will allow us to reduce cooking time, which can make us easier to get foods.
8.0	This is because the new technical appliances will make the cooking process more efficiency.
8.0	For example, we didn't have microwave ovens twenty years ago, so it was hard for us to cook dinner for our family.
8.0	But since we developed the microwaves, it has accelerated our cooking process.
8.0	It only takes us few minutes to prepare meals.
8.0	So I believe that in twenty years, there wll also be a booming development of cooking appliance that can increase the cooking efficiency.
5.0	In addition, the creed of being productivity has been adopted by many corporations that is considered to be consistend with the booming economy.
8.0	So how to save time in our life has been the prority of consideration by us.
8.0	Therefore, the cooking time must be decreased.
8.0	A good example in point is that a good friend of mine called Jack.
8.0	He is working in Apple.
8.0	He always complain to me that he always have no time cooking.
8.0	So, we can safely say that the cooking time must be reduced in 20 years.
1.0	From what we discussed above, we can safely draw a conclusion that we will spend less time cooking and preparing food in twenty yeats than what we do today.
1.0	Because it is not only a result of the development of techniques but it can aslo guarantee our working pruductivity.
12.0	I disagree with this statement .
8.0	because whatever post or now the parent will thinking more and decisions something more carefully.
8.0	Our parents is use to be a young people.
8.0	they may do something is same as us.
8.0	Like what courses should I take.
8.0	And they may have more good suggtions that I can choice.
8.0	They may don't understand what style is past   and what style is near us.
8.0	Just like me, last sunday I want buy some clothes.
8.0	and I ask my mom go shopping with me.
8.0	In a NIKE store.
8.0	I choice a T-shirt that is very popular.
8.0	but my mom said is not very good for me.
8.0	I can't understand if a T-shirt very popular now it means very one warm it is looks very hand \some or beauitful.
8.0	but in fact I am wrong.
8.0	It really not good for me.
8.0	I am look like a worker when I warm it.
8.0	it's really bad.
8.0	And I like buy some sneakers in ebay.
8.0	One day I saw a pair of AJ11 color caid Space Jam.
8.0	It's looks very cool.
8.0	And I am the fans of Jordon.
8.0	But it very expensive in that time.
8.0	need 250 dallors in that time.
8.0	I think nothing can stop me to by a pair AJ.
8.0	But my say you don't need buy this shoes now.
8.0	She ask me waiting some time it will more chaper.
8.0	But I decisions by myself.
8.0	the  results is I buy this shoes by 250 dallors.
8.0	but now it only 200 dallors.
8.0	Oh I will teel you mom is always reat.
8.0	because they
3.0	Thanks to the endeavor of the elder generation, nowadays, there are sufficiant finacially fair to contribute more public facilites, which has numerous benefits.
3.0	However, there is a discussion about how the government should spend this money, to upgrand Internet access or to enhance public transportation.
11.0	As for me, to acquire more knowledgy and make our life more colorful, I will prefer the Internet program.
5.0	Admittedly, it is truth that the public transportation, including the subway systems and high-speed rall, bring a lot of convenience for us.
8.0	In the past, when we get back our hometown, it was a nightmair.
8.0	This trip migh cost around severl days, even a half of month.
8.0	However, because of the advanced trasportation technology, we only spend a few hours on that we can arrive home.
5.0	But what play a more crucial role in our life is the technology of Internet.
8.0	With the Internet, we can shopping online and have access to endless knowledge.
8.0	Expecially, for the adolescient, who live under the sharp peer presure, they are requied to be a generalist and be proficient in Internet.
8.0	Last semester, I had a history research paper, which had a lot of acdamic terms that I had never heard.
8.0	But with the Internet, I just need to type some key words, then, the answer poped up.
8.0	"Like ""aqueducte"", I regarded it as a plant at first, but according to the ""Geogle"", I knew that ""aqueducte"" was a special concret, which could harden under water."
8.0	It was the Internet that I finished my paper more efficiently rather than spent many hours on searching in liberary.
0.0	On top of that, Internet can make our life more colorful.
0.0	In leisure time, we can watch the moives which we prefer instead of going outside and see some movie we do not care.
0.0	And Internet can help the disabled people to socialze.
7.0	To be more specific, they can chat with web friends in their own home and look
11.0	I disagree with this statement.
11.0	As for relaxing,it doesn't mean to have a simple rest.
12.0	The aim at relaxing is that refresh your  mind and comfort your body and heart.
12.0	Why does people need to relax?
11.0	There is no doubt that we are not facility.
9.0	Relaxing can help us to achieve our goals and continue our work better.
9.0	So we need to relax.
6.0	What matters the quality of relax is psychology.
8.0	I think doing physical exercise can relieve our pressure of psychology.
8.0	this menthod is convenient and simple.
8.0	Everyone can do it by yourself .
8.0	Then you don't need to take a lot of money to make a appointment with your psychologist.
8.0	The great advantage of doing physical exescise is refreshing your minds.
8.0	Getting the pleasure from physical exercise.
8.0	No matter you are professional or amateur ,doing physical exersie can bring a brilliant mind and fresh mind .
0.0	Through the physical exercise,we can forget the sadness and pain immediately.
0.0	Because we are absorbed in the exercise.
0.0	The focus will not pay more attention on other things.
8.0	Also,exercising can not only relax ourselves but also conquer the illness.
8.0	Fighting agiainst the illness and bulid up a healthy body.
8.0	So,obviously, It is better to relax by donging physical exercise than by reading a book or watching a movie.
8.0	There is no doubt that doing physical exercise has much advantages than reading a book or watching a moive.
3.0	With the development of people's awareness about the importance of education, more and more parents pay enormous efforts to search for variable methods to improve their children's grades.
11.0	In my opinion, however, awarding children money for each high grade they obtain in school is not a beneficial way to motivate the children.
4.0	First of all, offering children money when they get good grades will give them a sense that they are studying for money rather than knowledge.
8.0	It's not advantageous for their long-period development.
8.0	If children are motivated by the desire for money instead of curiosity to the world, they will probably form a money-oriented value, which in fact preventing them from establishing mental soundness.
8.0	It will be more likely that they are driven by the stress to grasp wealth when they enter adulthood.
4.0	Furthermore, children may spend the money carelessly, which prevents them from forming a right economic value.
8.0	For instance, my father often rewarded me with a lot of pocket money for my good grades when I was in primary school.
8.0	As a small child at that age, I had no consideration about planning to spend the money meaningfully.
8.0	Therefore, I never saved the money and bought anything I want without thinking about the price.
8.0	When my father found that I bought lots of useless commodities and toys, he decided to cease awarding me money and required me to learn to control my expenditures.
4.0	Last but not least, giving children money for high grades prevents them from challenging themselves.
9.0	"They are possibly satisfied when they are rewarded for an ""A"" on the exam paper and stop working hard to get more acheivements."
9.0	Only when they are required at a higher level will they be motivated to imrove themselves to be better.
2.0	In a word, offering children money won't be a good choice, since it may cause alot of problems and do harm to children's growth.
3.0	How to success in job can always raise debate in the society.
3.0	Many of us, the undergraduates, face so many suggestions about this question from our relatives or friends.
11.0	Some of them hold the view that the ability to relate well to people is more important than studying hard in school.
12.0	However, I disagree with this idea.
11.0	As far as I am concerned, the social skills is as important as studying hard in school.
12.0	I will illustrate my point for following reasons.
5.0	To begin with, social skills is important in our future job.
8.0	During our learning period, many of us neglect the significance of the ability to relate well to people.
8.0	But the importance of if maybe beyond our imagination.
8.0	In our future job, we need to communicate with others everyday.
8.0	As an agent, you need to communicate with your client to know their requirements.
8.0	As a  researcher, you need to report your study to gain support from others.
8.0	As a manager of project, you need to exchange ideas with your team to finish your tasks.
8.0	Communicatoin is the thing we can never avoid.
8.0	It is the ability to relate well to people that help us to do our job better.
8.0	Also, people are too subjective to listen to others thoughts sometimes.
8.0	Only when you have the ability to relate well to people will they listen to your own ideas.
5.0	In addition, we can never attach too much significance to studying hard in school.
8.0	Knowledge you gained in school can benefits you in many aspects.
8.0	If your job is related to your major, what you learned in school build a solid foundation which you can benefit from it forever.
8.0	With relative knowledge, it will be easier for you to solve prefessional problems than others without these.
8.0	For instance, my father, who majored in engeneering, managed building project.
8.0	Owing to his professional knowledge, their project save much in design.
8.0	Even if your job is not related to your job, you can also benefit from your studying ability you gained in school.
8.0	The studying ability is not innate.
8.0	You must practice it again and again in your learning period so that you can study effecient by yourself in your future job.
2.0	To summarize, both the ability to relate well to people and studying hard in school is crucial in a future job.
7.0	We can never neglect the
12.0	Recently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people: whether being creative rather than planning carefully will come up with the best solution to a problem.
12.0	As far as I am concerned, being creative will come up with the best solution to a problem.
6.0	To begin with, being creative can create some new methods which can be the best solution to a problem.
8.0	To be more specific, soemtimes, the best solution is not exist and people need to come up with something new to solve the problem.
8.0	Being creative can help people find the new way to solve the problem instead of the old and uneffective ways.
8.0	On the contrary, planning carefully just help people to use what they have now to solve the problem and that may not be the best solution, For example, when Newton found the apple falled from trees, he never planing carefully to use the knowledge he had to explain the question.
8.0	He was very creative and he want to find something new.
8.0	Finally, he found the gravity.
1.0	To be followed, being creative can provide better products.
1.0	To illustrate, the better products will be sold more in the market.
8.0	And the most importasnt thing of a better product is having something which others are lacking.
8.0	In this case, only being creative can produce better products.
8.0	On the other hand, planning carefully can not create something new.
8.0	For instance, Apple, one of the biggest company in our worlds, never planning carefully about what their phone should be suit for people.
8.0	They are creative and force people to suit their phone.
7.0	ther
3.0	With more entertainment such as films,novels and music showing up, is it better to relax by wathching a movie or reading  books than relax by doing physical exercise?
3.0	The phenomenon that people nowadays tend to relax by watching or reading instead of doing exercise triggers a heated debat: some claim to relax by watching or reading is better,while others oppose the standpoint.
11.0	As far as I am concerned, I preceive that the later is better.
11.0	My reasons are as follows.
5.0	The first reason is that doing exercise is beneficial physically and mentally.
8.0	Namely, while sweating, due to the physical exercise, we can meanwhile have a sense of satisfaction.
8.0	We have to admit that usually running or merely walking helps our bodies stay healthy.
8.0	Nevertheless, if we lie on the bed day and night,will we feel full of energy?
8.0	Of course not.
8.0	Only doing apporate exercise can
5.0	Another reason is its low cost.
10.0	Watching or reading, plainly,cost a number of money, while exercise are able to be done by just running.
2.0	Otherwise, watching a movie or reading books enable us to relax throughoutly,without feeling so tired.
3.0	Nowadays, more and more parents trend to offer money to their school-age children for each high grade.
3.0	Thus, a debate has occured that is it a good idea?
11.0	In my opinion, I am in favor of it.
12.0	Not only can they learn to manage finance but also help them to realise the importance of saving money.
5.0	As is known to all, school-age children usually spend money without plans.
8.0	There are some reasons.
8.0	For one thing, they know that they will get money in a very short time because their parents give them money for many times rather than offer them money for each grade.
8.0	For another, they don't realise the importance to save money and it's not necessary to make a plan because they don't have lots of money.
8.0	However, if the they receive money for each grade, they have to make plans to spend money, or they will have no money to use if they spend all the money.
8.0	As time passes, they will learn to manage finance.
5.0	Furthermore, it will help them to be more independent.
9.0	First, they have to learn to manage finance.
2.0	But if all the money has been spent, they will start to work to make their lives.
9.0	At the same time,
12.0	Nowadays, it's a heating debating topic that whether parents should use money to reward students if they do a good job in school.
11.0	I think it is not a good idea to use money to promote students.
4.0	A student will be willing to study hard if they know they can get money from thier high mark.
8.0	They may be mroe likely to ask teachers what they  are not farmiliar with and review what they have learnt before.
8.0	Because they want to get higher grade and money to buy whatever they want.
8.0	Nevertheless, using money to promote may be also a problem because they may need more money to encourage after a long time.
8.0	They may think that one handred dollars are not enough if they get higher mark.
4.0	Students may lose the money which is given to them.
8.0	students are more likely to buy what thier parents ban with the money that parents cannot control and ask for more money to buy books and schoolthings.
8.0	This may be a bad habit because they are always waste the money on  what is useless to them.
8.0	They may even buy the goods wich are harmful to them such as games.
4.0	It's also a pressure for parents.
8.0	Making money is not easy for everyone.
8.0	Parents made a huge effort to create a good life for students.
8.0	Parents have pay a lot for students to go to the best school.
8.0	It is not moral to ask for more money even if they get high mark at school.
8.0	especially for some poor families.
0.0	It's students' duty to study hard and get high grade at school.
0.0	Students should work hard for thier better life in the future instead of the money from thier parents.
0.0	Parents have done a lot for students.
0.0	We should also use high mark to make parents be happy.
3.0	With the development of the ecnomic and the increase of the population it is very important  to have the good relate with people and a very good grade.
12.0	We must have these two kind of abilities that we could success in the future join the job.
11.0	So it is hard to say one aspect is more important than the other one and I do not agree with the idea.
6.0	First, the ability to relate well with other people is very importent because that deside we can do the job good or bad.
8.0	Today cooperate is very necessary.
8.0	If we want finish the assignment that boss give to us, we must communicate with our collague to find the solution of the problem.
8.0	And good relationship between you and you collague will let the job more efficient.
8.0	For example, this summer I participate into a summer project and I could work in a company.
8.0	We were devided into several groups to finish some business problem.
8.0	I am the leader of our group and I am good at relate well with others.
8.0	I often buy juice for them and a make some jok with them.
8.0	Not only that we often have lunch together, we know each other very well.
8.0	One day the boss give us a very difficult problem and our group was order to solve this problem.
8.0	When our group members know this news, they active very quickly.
8.0	I charged in devide the  assignment to each member.
8.0	They all agree with my management because we have very good relationship.
8.0	No one feel they do more work and feel unfair.
8.0	By these way we finish the meter imposibal very smooth.
10.0	Second, have a good acdamic level is also ver
12.0	I agree that it is better to relax by doing physical exercise.
12.0	Nowadays,more and more people are chasing to relax by watching a movie or reading a book,but other people choose to  do some physical exercise.
12.0	Most people ignored that physical exercise can bring us more than reading books or watching a movie.
12.0	As far as I am concerned, doing physical exercise is better.
6.0	It is hard to deny that watching movies or reading a book can calm our nerves.
8.0	But when we are doing physical exercise,we aim to win.
8.0	In other words,when we are doing sports,we learn to help the team to cooperate with others and chase the success.
8.0	Therefore,it can develop a physically and mentally healthy life.
8.0	In addition,physical exercise makes the people know that freindship goes beyond the match.
8.0	No doubt that collisions and  quarrels may sometimes occur,the key which is to all competors should understand is friend values more than games.
8.0	It is one meaning of life and this cannot be learned when you watching movie or reading books.
8.0	To sum up,watching movies or reading books cannot bulid our body and mind.
8.0	Obviously,doing physcial exercise is the most effecitive way to relax.
3.0	How would you feel when you lose an unit of a program but the deadline is to near for you to do it right now while you just neglectd the advice given by your team member before, thinking that it is totally unneccesary?
3.0	How would you feel when all your team members leave the team leaving only you to finish the whole project while you just take no notice of their advice?
3.0	All above are due to the neglect of the advice of the team members.
12.0	From my perspective, I think the leader of a team should listen to these advices for the greater good instead of just insist on his own idea.
5.0	For one thing, ones own angle towards a problem can't always cover all the aspects which are essential to the project.
8.0	Only with all the endeavor made by all the members of a team can they successfully reach their destination.
8.0	For example, if a person who are so confident on himself become a leader of a team, he just take care of all the work following his own mind.
8.0	When a team member comes up with an advice that does good for this project like writting a code that is more efficient, he can hardly listen to it for accepting this advice means his ability is lower.
5.0	For another, the team member will be disappointed about this and even worse leave the team.
8.0	Everyone desires to be admitted by other people.
8.0	If a person's advice always be objected by the team leader, he will gradually feel disappointed thinking that all his adivces are just rubbish that have no value.
8.0	As time goes by, this kind of emotion will spread to the whole team and thus the working environment will become liveless for seven days a week, everyone has no enthusiasm to continue this project anymore.
8.0	Furthermore, they will leave the team for they don't want to work and can't get joy out of it, which will make the team leader quite embarassed and have to think out a far more sophisticated way to solve this dilemma.
3.0	There are kinds of way the educate children, self experience can must be the best one.
3.0	Children fell to the ground before leaning how to walk.
3.0	They get burnt before leaning the hot water is dangerious.
3.0	They bite their tongues before they learning no talking on tables.
11.0	I'm totally agree with that parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their mistakes.
12.0	Humans are eazy to learn from their own experience because it's more impressive then learning from books and other man's words.
5.0	There was an experiment about letting a shark learn by putting a thick glass wall between shark and a tasty fish.
8.0	the shark can only see the fish but can't reach it.
8.0	After dozens of times hitting the glass wall,the shark learnt about the pain and stopped wanting the fish,even the wall was moved away.
8.0	You can never tell a active boy not cliambing a tree unless he broken his leg by falling from the tree.
8.0	There is not much obedient children who may learn form books and others' warnning.
8.0	An adventurer may get harm from taking risks,but he do make a better surviver himself.
5.0	This statement fits me well because I was badly mutilated on my arms in the age of 7 by playing a knife.
10.0	After that I learnt how to use a knife properly and safely.
1.0	"And as the old saying goes ,""faliure is the mother of success"",making mis takes can led to more easy ways in the future life."
1.0	So I'm standing for the statement.
11.0	Several abilities are considered to play an important role in our work and study, such as learning abiliy, hands-on ability, critical thinking ability, academic ability, leadship and so on, among which some are thought to be born with while others can be obtained by learning.
12.0	There has been a debate about whether leadership is a gift or not.
11.0	Some peole firmly belive that one cannot learn to become a leader, but as far as I am concerned, It is my opinion that learnning can also makes a great leader.
12.0	My reasona are as followed.
5.0	To begin with, not everyone is a genus, one can gain a lot of abilities throught learning, including the leadership.
8.0	In other words, practice makes a man perfect.
8.0	Taking myself as an example, when i first enrolled in the students union, i knew nothing about  how to become a leader as i had no relative experience.
8.0	However, after a year in it, i watched how my team leader solved all kinds of emergency, i summerized and got my own precious experience.
8.0	The next year witnessed me as a great leader in my team.
8.0	From this case, i did not have any gift, but i did become a good leader throught hard work.
5.0	In addition, as the old saying goes, failure is the mother of success, i firmly believe that if one can become a great leader through practice, such as making mistakes and correcting oneself from them.
8.0	For instance , my leader in my current company, she has worked for several years,.
8.0	Up till now, she still makes mistakes as i do in my work, but the thing is that  she quickly learned form them and will avoid them.
8.0	She used to do things like me but it is all those mistakes that perfect her and make her a better leader.
0.0	Although it is much easier for some people who are born to be a leader, people who learn to be leader will be more modest and willing to learn from others.
0.0	In conclusion,  it is more motto that if one try hard, one can accomplish a lot.
0.0	Like the ad of one famous sports shoes says, nothing is impossible.
0.0	If one want to become a leader, then try one's best to do it, to make mistakes , to challenge oneself , to conquer all the obatcles that get in the way, eventually, we may find that in a blink of eye, we have met the demand and  gained all the abilities the a leader requied.
12.0	Nowdays,there is a promblem that if parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.
11.0	As for as I am cncerned,I agree with this statement.
11.0	Reasons are following.
6.0	First of all,we are not saints and we can not be free from faults.
8.0	Therefore,parents have the reason to give their children chances to make mistakes.
8.0	Besides,only when we have exprienced ourselves can we get a lesson.
8.0	Nobady else can take our place.
8.0	For children,helpful advice from parents is less useful than their own experience.
8.0	"There is an old saying in China,""Turn back untill hit the south wall."""
8.0	Thus it can be seen that parents should let their children hit the south wall.
8.0	Finally,facing problems and making mistakes is a shortcut way for children to improve independentability.
2.0	In summary,I agree with the statement that let children make misakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.
7.0	Only in this way ,children can g
3.0	About this topic, there are many different views from many people.
11.0	Some people believe that use lesure time to watching a movie is the best way to relax, many people agree with that.
11.0	On the countray, other people think going outside to play some sports or workout are more healther, and I agree with the later idea.
6.0	First of all, use lesure time to doing some physical exercise is good for body.
8.0	there is a saying in my country, workout not just give people a good body, also give people a strong will.
8.0	Take my friend jack for example.
8.0	Jack was a lazy and fat boy.
8.0	When he are free or on weekend, he will lay one his bad and watch TV for all day, Therefore he get bigger and bigger, and his body is full of sickness.
8.0	However his dad talk to him, tell him he need to workout to change himself.
8.0	So Jack start to change, he  run arround his gardon at morining, go to gym at night.
8.0	He has been workout like this for three month.
8.0	Finally, he become a handson man, also six pack abs.
8.0	From the example above, it is doing physical exercise made him succeed.
1.0	Secondly, doing exercise also can help peolple to forgot the unhappy things.
1.0	When people are confuse or dispoint, people could try to go outside play some sports, sweeting a lot, and go home take a shower, therefore everything will be fine.
3.0	In universities, student have the freedom to choice whatever courses they would like to take.
12.0	However recently, some people claim that all college students should take history classes whether it is needed or not, whether willing or not.
11.0	From my point of view, university students should not be forced to learn history.
5.0	Firstly, extra courses would be burdernsome for university students.
8.0	As we all know that most college students are busy with term papers, exams, or interning.
8.0	Taking myself for example, my family was not able to afford the expenses of college.
8.0	As a result, I have no choice but to study very hard on major courses to get good grades and win scholarships.
8.0	In the second semaster, the university require every students to learn history in classes, bring about more afterclass tasks.
8.0	There were times when I have to stay up until very late to finish history tasks and other papers.
8.0	Had the university not require taking history classes, I would have had sleep earlier and been more concerntrated on next day's courses.
5.0	Secondly, an unignorable amount of money would be spent on seting new history classes and hiring history teacher.
10.0	In fact, for some universities, in which history is not the main researching field, the money is a huge waste.
7.0	I admit that history should not be forgotten by teenagers,
12.0	When it comes to the issue whether parents should point out rhe mistakes of their children or not, different people have different interpretations of issue.
12.0	Some hold the idear that letting children make mistakes will induce unnecessary losses, however, on the personal level, I believe that there are some advantages if parents let their chilfren make mistakes.
5.0	First of all, there is no doubt that children can absorb experience from mistakes and avoid to make mistakes again。 Experiences can be reinforced through the mistakes.
8.0	We often have the experience that when we made the mistakes.
8.0	We will remember the mistake for a long time and do not make it again.
8.0	For instance, when I was an elementary school students, my father always looked through my math homework again and again and found mistakes finally, during this process, it made me through profoundly, so I wouldnever make again.
8.0	Therefore, it is sagacious to let children make mistakes and learn from them.
8.0	Futher leading to my position is that for children, mistakes enrich their childhood.
8.0	Thinking about if parent always point out mistakes for their children, children will have smooth life without any things that deserve to be remembered.
8.0	One of the effects that mistakes have on child is that it will bring an abundant life ehich includes happiness, sadness or pain.
5.0	Moreover, as for parents, letting children make mistakes canmitigate their pressure.
8.0	Since parentscare about many thing every day, they not only take care of chindren's daily life, but also need to earn money to support the family.
8.0	Although finding mistakes in one of the responsibilities of parents, they will under too much pressure if they do so.
8.0	When children learn from their own mistakes, to some extend, it can reduce parents pressure.
8.0	Thus, considering parents' stress, it is wise to let children acquire knowedge from mistakes and mitigate the pressure from parents.
7.0	To sum up, we can safely draw the conclusion that parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes, since it can absorb experiences, enrich childhood and reduce parent's
11.0	I think it is better to relax by doing physical exercise than relax by watching a movie or reading a book.
11.0	If I am going to relax,I must have done something complex with my mind.
12.0	If I have dong much exercise,I will do nothing but sleep to relax myself,rather than watch a movie or read a book.
4.0	Watching a movie and reading a book is a smart activity.
8.0	I should use my eyes,ears and my brain to understand what it want to express.
8.0	It is a kind of high-duty work for us.
8.0	After a long time of using my eyes,they will hurt and so I don't feel relaxed.
8.0	So does my mind.
8.0	After watching a movie,I will think a lot of the plots to draw a conclution and sigh with emotion.
8.0	That can consume much of my energy.
8.0	I just go on working but not relaxing.
4.0	Doing exercise is different from Watching a movie or reading a book.
8.0	It is the real relax.
8.0	First,such as running,I need't to think while I am running.
8.0	What's more,I can listen to the music without understanding what it means.
8.0	I just need enjoy the rythem.
8.0	It is the liberation of my mind.
8.0	So do other kinds of sports.
4.0	Second,doing exercise is good for our health.
8.0	When we keep sitting near the computer for a long time,our bodies can't tolerate it.
8.0	We may have a backache,a headache,etc.
8.0	It's not a kind of illness,it's a signal sent out by our bodies to mark us that they are not comfortable.
8.0	They need to move to relax.
8.0	It is better than sitting again to watch something.
1.0	Final,doing exercise is a good way to make friends so that we can share something interesting for fun.
1.0	Also outdoor activities make us breathe fresh air to clear our mind.
3.0	Some parents offer their school-age childrenmoney for each high grade they get in school.
12.0	I didn't agree this method.
12.0	The reason why I have this conclustion is that I insist that study should be accepted by children.
12.0	We can use some method to let children be  interested in studying,but use money isn't a good idea.
12.0	Then I will provide my point to explain.
6.0	First of all, the child is innocence and they don't understand the rule of society.
8.0	Using money to stimulate children studying hard will let they lost thier innocence characteristic and wiil prompt the child to learn knowleage only for money.
8.0	Second, many parent have a wrong consideration that they only know studying is a way to change kids' destiny but they don't uderstand what the studying real is and what thier child really can require from the studying.
8.0	What we can really studying from the school is the attitude for the world and the atititude for face the trouble we will meet.
8.0	For example, when i was a children, I don't like to study.
8.0	So my mark is bad.
8.0	But my primary teacher tell me a word that if a person don't know how to consider the question whatever they will meet and they will lost themself.
8.0	I didn't understand what my teacher's meaning is.
8.0	But as the time gone, when I grow up, I can understand what my teacher means.
8.0	It means that everyone should kown the reason whay we do something.
2.0	Thaking all the factors into considerations, I don't agree they way that some parents offer their school-age children money for each  hgh grade they get in school,but we should let they know why they should learn and what they can get from the book.
10.0	Thanks for
3.0	In the highly competitive society, every one is eager to learn more knowledge to broaden their horizon.
12.0	However, there is a hot debate about what people should react if their teacher or leader says something wrong during the class or meeting.
11.0	A lot of people say it is important to correct this mistake instantly.
11.0	Others might say the best thing ro do is say nothing.
11.0	However, as far as I am concerned.
12.0	I think the best way to do is wait till the class or the metting is over and tell the teacher and the leader about their mistakes.
4.0	I admit that correct the mistake immediatly is the most convenient way.
8.0	If the teacher or the leader says something incorrect the student or the empoloyees may not successfully understand their meaning, and that could cause a lot of issues.
8.0	However, interupt now may cause other troubles too.
8.0	For instance, your leader or reacher may think you are rude and your classmates might consider you as disruptive.
8.0	Most of the situation is the teacher and the leader even the students has already know the mistake.
8.0	They do not correct the mistake because they do not want to waste the time.
8.0	But if people disturb them it will be time consuming and the people who correct this mistake might get poor impression.
4.0	Say nothing is not appropriate.
8.0	If the mistake is not corrected in time.
8.0	The student or the employees still can not get the right meaning of what their teacher or the leader has said.
8.0	And there is a lot probability the students and the employees will misunderstand the order and cause a lot of issues.
8.0	For examole, my uncle is the leader of the company.
8.0	Once he had a meeting he said the company needed to bid no more than 50 thousands dollar.
8.0	But the truth is he misread the number and the real number is 5 thousands dollar.
8.0	In the end my uncle got the punishment from the company.
4.0	Wait till the end of the class or the meeting and then correct the mistake is the best way.
8.0	Because lots of people care about their reputation, if people correct their mistake right in front of every one's face.
8.0	The teacher and the leader will feel ashamed.
8.0	If peole make them fell embarressed.
8.0	They will leave a bad impression for their teacher and leader.
8.0	So wait till the class or the meeting is over.
8.0	People can talk to them privatly and this behavior may make your teacher or leader feel you are considerate and habe a greater chance to earn their trust.
8.0	Once I found my teacher's mistake and I corrected her afer the class in person, in the end she thanked me and had me as her assistant.
0.0	So when your teacher or your leader makes a mistake.
0.0	Please do not immediatly correct them or say nothing.
0.0	The best way to do is after the class or meeting is over, talk to them face ro face and then correct the mistake.
0.0	You might find it is beneficial to your relation with the teacher or the leader.
3.0	There's no doubt that everyone is being influenced by others, since we all live the complex society.
3.0	Some people claim that teachers have stronger imflunece on students than their friends due to the assistence of teahers on one' s growth.
3.0	On the contrary, I hold the opposite viewpoint that even though teachers may help us in acadamic study, friends influnce us more.
5.0	First and foremost, students are more willing to listen to friends' suggestions than teachers.
8.0	It is clear that nearly every teenager has period when he is rebellious.
8.0	At that time, students regard their teacher as enermy and unlikely to act what thet are told.
8.0	For instance, when I was in the eighth grade, I had disagreement with my parents.
8.0	Then I left home and visited one of my classmate's home.
8.0	Even though my teachers called me several times, it is my friend who persuaded to come back home.
8.0	As a result, i strongly assert that friends have more impact.
5.0	Moreover, students know us better and we feel more at ease to share our feeling with our friends.
8.0	Since teachers are always regarded someone to be respectful and awed, it is hard for us to tell teachers our ture emotions.
8.0	To illustrate, one of my best friends in high school failed in her college entrance exams.
8.0	As the examines partialy determined one's fate, it's not hard to imagine how frustrated she was.
8.0	However, when our head master tried to comfort her, she just said she was OK.
8.0	Later that day, she came to me and cried in my arms, which I still feel sad for her whenever I recalled such a scene.
8.0	Therefore, students are more likely to be imfluencd their friends, since friends have more opportunities to help them out.
11.0	With the ways of relax becoming more and more diverse, many people may choose to relax by watching amovie or reading a book than ralax by doing physical exercise.
11.0	But I think that relaxing by doing physical exercise should not lose its popularity.
6.0	It is known to all that if you have a healthy body, you can do whatever you want to do.
8.0	When one does physical exercise, he would enjoy the process and his muscle would become relaxing completely.
8.0	His body gets stronger.
8.0	So, it is clear that he will become healthier when he relaxes.
8.0	Also, one can make acquaintance with many other people who he couldn't meet when working.
8.0	It is just a relationship of exercising.
8.0	During the process of relaxing by doing physical exercise, they can build up a bond without personal benefit.
8.0	Then they can become intimate friends and share the different experiences when  doing physical exercise.
8.0	The two points that mentioned above cannot be attained when you relax by watching a movie or reading a book indoors.
8.0	Meanwhile, doing physical exercise can also attract others to take the action of relaxing by doing physical exercise.
8.0	Once the atmosphere forms, the circle of doing physical exercise would come into being.
8.0	Then everyone can enjoy himself and share joy with others.
8.0	They can also become brothers or sisters.
1.0	So, in my opinion, I firmly believe that it is better to relax by doing physical exercise than relax by watching a movie or reading a book.
1.0	As relaxing by doing physical exercise is good for you and me, we should ralax by doing physical exercise without hesitation.
11.0	These days, there is a growing tendency that more and amore people choose to help the struggling strangers instead of neglecting them.
11.0	Some people may hold the opinion that it is meaningfulless to help a stranger, others, however, arguing that since we all be confronted with difficulties, we are supposed to help anyone who is in need.
12.0	From my perspective, I am convinced that help the struggling strangers plays an significant role in our daily life.
4.0	First and foremost, it is our instinct to help others who are in danger.
8.0	It is a commom sense that giving a hand to other people is a normal thing because everyone in the world may go through challenges.
8.0	What is more, we are educated to care for others and be kindful to all the people since we were children.
8.0	For example, if I see an old woman crossing the roads, what emerges on my mind first might be accompanying her carefully to pass the avenue.
4.0	Secondly, to help the struggling strangers stands for our enthusiasm to both the individuals and the society, from which we are able to nourish our mind and improve our social skills.
9.0	Bseides, having done such things, we will feel a sense of fufillment and peace, thus making us have a comprehensive understanding of morality and responsibility.
9.0	To be more accurate, if we help others without payback, we can not only recognize the importance of harmony but also understand how individuals affect the whole society.
4.0	Last but ont least, what we can not ignore is that the current social atmosphere motivates us to help strangers who are faced with hardships.
8.0	For an instance, there are so many billboards, posters, and slogans around our cities to appeal our attention to be helpful to others.
8.0	Bseides, evne though what we have done might be so tiny that  it cannot change a person's life, we indeed convert our kindness and warmth to them so that they can feel our love.
8.0	What is more, by helping others we have more opportunities to hook up with new friends and abroaden our horizons.
1.0	To put it in a nutshell, it is our obligation to help the struggling strangers.
1.0	Only by this way that we are able to create a harmonious environment and make our life more wonderful and prosperous!
3.0	In recent years, parents are likely to award their children for high marks they got in shcool.
3.0	As a senior high shcool student, I think this is a win-win idea.
4.0	From my perspective, study can be boring and tiring sometimes.
8.0	In this way, students may need some encouragement to help them get through the difficulties they face when study, it's not a easy thing anyway.
8.0	And gradually your children begin to have their own hobbies that they won't tell you somehow, so you may not know what to buy to encourage them.
8.0	In this way, they may need money as a form of award.
8.0	Only if they get the money in their own pocket can they make the use of it in a way they would like.
4.0	On the one hand offering your shool-age children money for each grade mark they get in school can satisfy them and give them ample energy to study in the future and do their best in the meantime.
8.0	And it also gives your children a kind of feeling of success.
8.0	And as they grow older they will have to manage their own money, so why not start now?
8.0	Your children can find a way to manage their own money and make good use of them.
8.0	So in the future, when they have to live on their own, they won't spend money without a plan.
8.0	And they may do the management of money better than the person who didn't get money when they got a high mark in shcool.
4.0	On the other hand, once they got money, they will continue to study harder in the future because they know if they don't do so, they may not get money again.
9.0	Once they have got used to study hard and do things trying theri best, they will keep on doing like this.
9.0	As a consequence, when they enter the university, they won't find themselves wondering all day not knowing what to do, instead they will learn a lot by themselves, which can enrich their lives.
2.0	In all, from my point of view, it can be a brilliant idea to offer school-age children money for high grade they get in schoo.
12.0	Nowadays, more and more parents think when their kids get a good grades at school, they should be given some present like money.
12.0	But I think it is not the best present for kids.
4.0	Although when your child get a good grade at school is a fantastic thing to you, you will be prond of your child, you can give other things like a big dinner or a book which child maybe like it, but money is not suitable for child.
10.0	Because if child get money, they will buy something which are not helpful for their health like chips, childs cannot identify the goods are good for them or bad for them.
4.0	Actually, chidren do not have ability to protect their money.
8.0	When they meet some people who want to cheat them to get their money, they cannot find and give the money to these people.
8.0	Also when children who are paying for something, a bad teenagers who want to get money will follow them.
8.0	When the people on street is less the bad teenagers will stop the children and bit them.
8.0	In the end, the bad guys get the money and children be broken.
4.0	The third reason is, children cannot control their unlimited wants becuse they do not know how the money is difficult to get.
9.0	So they will pay it at anywhere they want.
9.0	For example, if something which they want to get they can afford it, whatever how expensive the thing it is, they will buy it to achieve their wants.
0.0	So in my opinion, when children do well at school course, parents can get them to a huge restraunt or an ammusement park to let them feel well to get good grades.
0.0	But please remember, money is the thing which chidren are not suitable to have.
0.0	When the children get monry, there are many difficult problems  which parents should solve them.
12.0	I disagree techonology has made children less creative than they wew in the past.
12.0	Nowadays, almost everyone has phone and computer, there are less things without electric than before.
11.0	"But this is not a reason to explain ""technology has made children less creative than they were in the past."""
5.0	First, children can creative things which is more advanced than the past.
8.0	They can creative different things or things about eletric.
8.0	And  now we can know many things on the internet, we can know many events or news or something you want to know.
8.0	You can search things you want to know.
8.0	If you want to invent a thing, you can search some knowledge in the internet about this thing, it can help you more.
8.0	So many people think that many children get addicted to technology so that affect their study, but technology can tell children many things that they don't konw, so they can interested in the world and know more about the world.
5.0	Second, technology hasn't made children less creative than they were in the past, they just creative in another zone.
8.0	This is a technology generation, we needn't to live the same life like before.
8.0	Our competition is already different.
8.0	Our learning things also have a big difference, many study we have to finish on the internet, our entertainments are also on the internet.
8.0	We must to respect technology, because technology make our life more convenient and rich.
8.0	Now, our new generations competition is in technology, we compete to who can invent a new website or app.
8.0	And our creations are establish on technology.
7.0	I think that many people think some children have less creative because of the technology, but
11.0	I don't think that it's a good idea for parents to reward their children with money for high grade in school.
11.0	First, I think there's not only money that matters for the children.
11.0	School-age children need much more things than money such as love and care.
8.0	There's a very common case in remote places of China that both parents, or only one of them, go out to work for higher income, leaving their child at home alone, which has become a big issue of the nation.
8.0	Those children are at a higher risk of bad performance in school and even have a higher crime rate because of the lack of care, though they may get money from their parents for high mark.
8.0	What are the difference between those who give their children money and those who work out?
6.0	Second, being offered money in school will make the students feel like working, while in fact, school is a very different place from work.
8.0	In working places, people get paid because of their contribution to the society, but in school, it's the students' duty to learn.
8.0	Knowledge and acedemy should be pure, at least in primary and middle school.
8.0	Student should learn for knowledge, rather than money.
8.0	It's true that this method can raise the interest of some students to study, but it also has its side effect.
8.0	Giving students money would give them a sence that it's their right not to study well, because they sould suffer the unpayment and that is the cost.
1.0	Last, instead of offering money, I recommend that parents give their children some other things for good performance, such as time to play together, toys the child wants and other things, as long as you can make a bargin.
1.0	And money can be offered as pocket money instead of reward.
8.0	i am agree with this point,because childien is parents's lover and they wear always to forgive the children's mistake,and let them know something and grow up.
8.0	first of all,if you parents always help you and let you never make mistakes,you will loss some true thing.
8.0	when i am a little girl,i make a misetake which is i put my figer in the hot water,and then i get hurt.
8.0	when the things happen,my parents just look at me because they always tell me don't put the hot water by your finger before the time,but i am a naughy girl who dosen't get parents advise,so the girl get hurt.
8.0	but after this thing,i know the advice and keep a promise that is never put my figer in the hot water and hot anything.
6.0	even though your parents  let you make some mistakes,the mistake is not a  principle or irreverible things.
9.0	because they jaut want to you grow up and never want to real hurt you.
9.0	in the real word juts your parents will forgive you everything
2.0	sometimes people can't  remenber the advice by language,but the behavior they can.
3.0	Recently, an interesting question has aroused a heated debate among public: whether teachers should be paid at much as doctors, lawyers or business leaders are paid.
3.0	Answers vary from person to person.
3.0	Some people claim that teachers should be paid much.
11.0	However, I strongly believe that teachers should not  get so much salary.
11.0	My point can be elaborated as follows.
5.0	First of all, paying so much salary to teachers may cause a huge increase in students schooling cost, which is hard to match for some poor families.
8.0	Doctors and lawyers are paid a lot, and a school has many teachers.
8.0	If all of these teachers need so much money, it is sure that the school cannot pay for them by itself, the school must charge a large part of this money from students.
8.0	Students whoes family is not rich may drop out.
8.0	In the contrast, if teachers get a relative low salary, the schools and pay for them by itselves.
8.0	For example,  my  high school' teacher were paid 3000 yuan per month in averange and each year we students only need to hand on 700 yuan for our texbook.
5.0	Second, unlike doctors, lawyers and business leaders, teachers can earn money by help several students besides their schooling work.
8.0	Students in rich families or do not well in some certen subjects may find teachers to help them one by one and teachers will charge for these kind of help.
8.0	With people put more and more attention on their children' education,  pariends having econmocial ability are willing to pay of teachers.
8.0	For instance, I  did bad on may math class when I was in high school, and my mother really worried about me.
8.0	So she let a math teacher help my and paid 300 for every class.
1.0	To put it in a nutshell, I firmly believe that teachers should not be paid as much as doctors, lawyers and business leaders are paid.
1.0	This is not only because students should send more money if it is but also because teachers can easily get more money by doing some part time teaching.
12.0	I am the opponent of the idea that parent should allow children make mistakes and let them learn from it.
11.0	I have some reasons.
4.0	First, after making mistakes can them have an inpressions on what is right or what is wrong.
8.0	Take my own experience as instance.
8.0	When I was young I have a passion on the perfume of alcohol.
8.0	So every time my grandpa is drinking i climbed to get close to him and beg for some to taste,  you know, just to taste but not to drink.
8.0	Of cource, my grandpa know it is not good for my health.
8.0	So after some day when eating meals, I begged for wine as usual.
8.0	But this time my grandpa give a glass of wine and let me imbibed the whole.
8.0	What funny, as a consequence, I was shocked by the taste of alchol and from that time I never want to drink wine.
8.0	If my grandpa didn't let me drink the whole glass of wine, I wouldn't get aware of the hot of the alchol, and I will not know the impact of wine.
4.0	On top of that, I think after children make mistakes, parents should instruct their children.
8.0	In this way, kids can develop an correct reaction towards mistakes instead of depression.
8.0	I heard a story of a father take his son to travel.
8.0	The father is a genial father.
8.0	Every time when the son make mistakes or encounter some difficulties, he wil help his son.
8.0	One day they visited a lake, on the boat, the camera fell into the water because of the carefullness of the child.
8.0	The son was frightend with such a incident.
8.0	He worried his father would beat him, so he fell into depression.
8.0	But surprisingly, without shouting at his son, the father feel a little pity at first.
8.0	But after a moment, the father comforted his son, he said it was OK, he will buy a new  one for him, but the child should know how he made such a mistake.
8.0	After the instruction, the son admitted his fault and felt happy again.
8.0	We should admit that it is not the mistake  but the instructions that matters.
4.0	Finally, parents should let their children  make mistakes.
10.0	Only by doing mistakes and let them take the risk and solve the problem themselves can they grow up swiftly.
1.0	Making mistakes is not frightened.
1.0	Just let kids know what is right or what is wrong and find their own way to solve the problem can  they become more indepandant.
3.0	nowadays, some parents very full ,so they give their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.
12.0	i disagree this a good idea.
12.0	there are three opint to support my idea  first, pareent is behavior of offering money for their children is each high grade in schoolmake school - age missunderstand that grade or mark, is the most valuable standard to measure their acadment performance .
10.0	and ,oneyis it optimun way to express recogtition they have an alternative to tell theirchildren that process of acquing weigion and they always unberstansd them durning the way of learing for example the freguent communtation and their children learing activities second,  school -age children do not have a ,ature and sound consumption wiew once they got make money form they are likely to spend their pocket money without any limit before they have a cinsidertion they may form a bad spending money
6.0	thire,material rewards shound not be the bea=st way to encourage school-are children to have a better academic perfoem parents have obligation to let their school-age chidren know that only by studying hard .
10.0	can they achieve good examinations and marking efforts in study is all for their own choices of their future finally, i hope parents guve children ather school-agr like, prt or small gift.
7.0	not give they only money
3.0	Currently, a controversial topic has aroused heated debated: whether teachers should be paid at least as much as doctors, lawyers or business leaders are paid.
3.0	Opinions vary from people to people.
3.0	Some claim that teachers should get the equivalent salary as the doctors, lawyers or business leader, since they play an important role in the growth of children and devote lots of time and energy to promote comprehensive abilities of their students.
11.0	However, I hold an opposite view that teachers should not get the same wage as doctors, lawyers or business lawyer, because the decreasing significance on students.
5.0	First off, there are lots of resources on-line to substitute teachers and teachers become less importance.
8.0	To illustrate, with the appearance of diversity of technological gadgets, students can get access to the knowledge from coding and their major informations to language learning and basic development.
8.0	Teachers are not indispensible in the students' education any more.
8.0	Besides, the public courses on line is much more cheaper than the tutor fee.
8.0	In contrast, the doctors needs long time experience of diagnosing the disease; the lawyers needs to have excellent presentation skills and the ability of collecting evidences; the business leaders need to have outstanding organized ability and assign proper jobs for each one based on their ability and characters.
8.0	All of these jobs cannot be substitued by advanced technology.
8.0	In this case, teachers shouldn't be paid at least as much as doctors, lawyers or business leaders.
5.0	Additionally, the increasing engagement in their kids' education by modern parents, resulting the decreasing importance of teacher.
8.0	To elaborate, with the increasing of masses' affluence, more and more parents are aware of the importance of education in their kids' future and pay more attention on their kids' education.
8.0	The time and energy that teachers devote on their students are taken place by students' parents.
8.0	For one thing, at home, parents spend lots of time to work with their kids, review their homework, supervise them to preview textbooks and guarantee their attendence on time.
8.0	For another, at school, parents serves as members of teacher conference commitment, organize all kinds of activities such as basketball game and singing competition in order to cultivate their leisure hobby.
8.0	Under this circumstance, there is no reason that teachers should get the equal salary as doctors, lawyers, and business leaders.
8.0	By contrast, lawyers,doctors and business leaders are still required to put their all energy and time on their work and these jobs are very important in modern society.
2.0	To put it in a nutshell, teachers should not be paid at least as much as doctors, lawyers or business leader, since the role in students' education is decreasing and they are substituted by resources on-line and parents.
12.0	Some people believe offering children money for high grade will hurt them while others think otherwise.
11.0	I view it as a good idea to offer school-age children money for each high mark because of the following reasons.
4.0	Firstly, studying is a long period which needs to be concentrated on all the time.
8.0	One can easily be bored during the period.
8.0	But the stimulation of money can help them keep excited and interested in study.
8.0	This motivation can contribute to their study.
8.0	For instance, when I know I can have the moeny to buy toys if I get a full mark on the coming exam, I'm willing to do nothing but study.
4.0	Secondly, children may don't have the concept of what money is if they don't earn some money themselves.
9.0	Consequently, offerring money after they get high grade is a good method to let them realized the hardship that their parents paid to earn money.
9.0	I'm persuaded that when they received the money after thier hardwork in study, they can have a better understanding of what money is.
4.0	Even though i agree on offering children money, how to offer children money is also impotant.
9.0	The amount of the money and the rules of offerring money need to be considered clearly.
9.0	Letting the children involved in the consideration and telling them the right way to use the money they get are of giant significance.
7.0	To sum up, I view it as a good idea to offer school-age children money for each high mark, but the way of doing
11.0	I don`t think it`s a good idea to offer school-age children money for their high grade in school.
12.0	This phenomenom will do harm to their minds and their school work.
12.0	First of all, the behavior of offering money is astonishing.
11.0	There are so many things that are better than money,just like:toy cars,earphones and so on.
12.0	"If parents give them money,children will regard money as their motivation to study which is harmful;Second,this kind of ""award"" will develop a bad habit of pursuing money,which is disgusting;Last but not least,children`s mind is not fully developed,they don`t know how to use money,so it is not appopriate to give them mony."
6.0	Let me give you a example,when I was in middle school,I have a friend whose family is wealty.
8.0	His parents promised him to give him 100 yuan if he got an A.But his grade is not very good,his performance only deserves B so he can`t get his award.
8.0	Then he  came up with an idea:cheating.
8.0	He used his methods and got the money.
8.0	He did`t realized his mistake.
8.0	Finally,there came the final test which will decide whethere he can go to the high school.
8.0	Without doubt,he failed.
8.0	I still remember his tears,I can feel his regret and sorrow.
8.0	From his story,I can say,the behavior of offering money when children get a good grade is upsetting and astonishing.
2.0	I know,parents love their children,but please,love them in a right way.
8.0	When they get an A,give them a hug.
8.0	The expression of feeling is more effective than offering money.
8.0	Emotional caring can promote them to do better in school,that is what they need.
7.0	So at last, I would like to ask parents:stop offering money to children for their high grades,it is harmful and usel
3.0	Recently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people: should teachers be paid at least as doctors, business leaders or lawyers are paid?
3.0	opinions vary from person to person.
3.0	Some people claimed that teachers should not be paid at least as doctors, business leaders or lawyers are paid.
3.0	However, I would stand on their opposite side and I believe that teachers should get the salary at least as much as doctors, business leaders or lawyers are paid.
12.0	My viewpoints can be elaborated as follows.
6.0	Firstly, teachers are very important job which are worth to get the same salary at least as doctors, lawyers or business leaders.
8.0	Teachers just like the brightest lights in everyone's life.
8.0	We have been taught by teachers since we was in kingdergaten.
8.0	teachers play an important role in our life.
8.0	They teach us the knowledge which we can use in our whole life and these things are very valuable for everyone.
8.0	So that' s why teachers salary should at least as much as doctos,lawyers or business leaders.
8.0	For example, since I can remeber the things I have been companied by good teacher such as my teacher Mr. Hu in my elementary shool and my teacher Mrs. Wu in my high school.
8.0	They were very kindness and warm-hearted.
8.0	These personalities let me like to study and because I was very shy.
8.0	Because of them, I was willing to ask question and discuss to them which improved my study.
0.0	Secondly, teachers are a job which is very busy and tired.
0.0	As we know, teachers should stay in school at least as much time as students do.
0.0	Most of time, they should arrive at school earlier than all of the students and leave school latter than every students.
8.0	When they finish their whole work and get home, they still need to prepare tomorrow's teaching plan or keep touch with the parents of their students.
8.0	Teachers are always busy and they will have no time to take care of their own family.
8.0	However, our jobs like doctors, lawyers od business leaders can spend more time to stay with thier family.
8.0	For example, my high school teacher Mrs. Wu is a really responsiable teacher and she managed our class bery well.
7.0	But she divorsed last year because her husband thought she didn't care about their family and the
11.0	In my opinion,I agree with this statement that is the university should pay more saliries for the professors.
12.0	Give the professors a high saliries is a  good way to improve their work effiency and also there are some benefits for students.
4.0	In the first place, if the professor exposure a good saliries, they will pay more attention on his work, which can give the students a perfect enviorments to study.
9.0	For example, In the past, the professor cannot have a good saliries, they unwilling to devote themself into the education, If students ask them questions, they  always make short shrift of the students.
9.0	But in recent years, the  university have a huge change, they pay the professor more and also they will help the students solve their problems better.
4.0	Second, If the university pay a high saliries to the professor, the y may take their eyes to their families.
8.0	On the other hand, they will devote themself to the education, because they can have extra leisure money a month.
8.0	Most of them work for the families and give their children's more.
8.0	If they assess a good saliries, they can do whatever thay want.
8.0	Hence, they willing to see that the university give them a high saliries.
8.0	So this is why improve professor's saliries can increase their quality of the education.
4.0	Last bu not least,  if the university give them a lot that mean is they will spend less on  the basis facilities, for instance, bulid a new sports court or spend more on students basis life.
9.0	Most of the students want to have a good quality of thire life.
9.0	Rather than in education, these studnts tend to have a good life experience.
0.0	Given the above points, it is a better to give the professor a high saliries .
0.0	That is primarily because the professor can devote more to students;they can distract their attention from the family.
0.0	Thus I hope the university can give the professor a high salries,because I want to have good education.
12.0	Nowadays,internet had become and more important in our daily lifes.
8.0	For some people they are even the indispensable part of life.
8.0	We can gain a large number of information in a  shor time.
8.0	With no doubt, this can benefit people from every aspect.
6.0	Firstly, we can search a great deal of  information in a convenient way .
8.0	In today‘’s sociaty,even the little children know to use google to get infromations.
8.0	Just click the button and thousands of informations will pop up in one second.
8.0	No matter the acadamic knowlege, the daily news or the stars‘ gossip.
8.0	We can get to know these things in anywhere.
12.0	Recently, an interesting topic has aroused a heated debate among public: which has more influence on your happiness, your job or social life.
11.0	The answer varies from person to person.
11.0	From my perspective, I believe that the job definetly has a more positive effect on our happiness.
5.0	To begin with, the salary from the job would makes us happy.
8.0	As we know, most of people are trying to search for a decent job in order to improve their life quality, which means they have ability to purchase what they want to buy.
8.0	In this case, once they spend their salary on the product which they are dreaming for a long time, they are more likely to receive a sence of satisfaction.
8.0	On the contrary, people cannot get money from their social life even they have to arrange their budget on social life so they cannot get happy from there.
8.0	For example, my sister works on the high school as a teacher.
8.0	Last week she told me she have ability to afford a Coach purse because she saved her salary for it for a long time.
8.0	At the moment she bought the purse, I could see a big smile on her face.
5.0	Furthermore, the accomplishment that is attained in the work allow people to feel glade.
8.0	This is because in the work people cannot avoid dealing with some tough work arranged by their boss.
8.0	It can be imagine that through struggling for the hard job by overworking, once they finish it they will receive a huge sense of accomplishment.
8.0	Without doubt, the gratification makes people happy.
8.0	On the contrary, social life is less likely to give people a tough job so people will not get happiness from it.
8.0	For example, last week, my mom dedicated her much time on a project of her company for a week and she have never come home before 9 pm.
8.0	However, after she finished that project flawlessly, she felt she did a great job and so happy that invite our family to congratulate with her.
1.0	To sum up, the job exert more effect on people's happiness than social life does.
1.0	This is because people can spend their salary on their dreaming products and receive a sense of accomplishment.
11.0	Many  university want to improve they education quality so to give more money to professor ,i think it is not good idea because sometimes spend more money than before not can solve then main problems.
6.0	First, some professor are not  good the for student  like many student dislike the professor because they power point is so bad, they are not good at communcate with student , homework are very difficult but he not teach them on the class etc. some students think they just want to earn the money not to focus on the teaching.
10.0	If the university spend more money on salaries for university professor  it is not a good idea to improve the quality of education.
7.0	Second ,universty want to improve the edaucation quality can spend money on train  the professor because professor 's job  is teaching students to get knowledge , so we can make a meeting to communcate to each other how to improve the education qualify or  spend money to hire the professional trainer to teach them and help to imporve the teaching
3.0	Never before in the history has the problem of helping struggling strangers been such salient than today.
3.0	In the past, peope did not help struggling people cause they have not knowledge, no meodths, not kind of time.
11.0	However, people today have more free time and more knowledge, and they do have meodths to help them.
11.0	Personally speaking, People today are more willing to help with the struggling strangers.
4.0	First of all, people have more knowledge and more tools to help with struggling people than people in the past.
8.0	With the sociaty became more multiple, people have more tools and techology to help others.
8.0	For instance, a people was lying in the raod, and the passer can use their phone to call the amblenence, and they can pick up the struggling people's phone to call the famlity in the memo.
8.0	It is more convinence to save other and help others, but we can not do it like that easy way in the past, the only thing we can do was shouting and waiting more pass-by that they can help us move the struggling people to the hostiple.
4.0	Secdondly, the education todat is more humanlism than beofore.
9.0	We have been tought that you should help others inneed, but in the past sociaty is complex, parents always told us came back as fast as you can, outside is dangerous.
9.0	However, we can are told by others that you should help others and imagine that if you are sick and lie in the street, none will save you as well.
4.0	Admittedly, people in the past may willing to help with others, but they have not meoths, and knowledge, they did noy learn how to give a first treatmet to the struggling man, and the if them do that in a bad way, it will hurt them even more, and people can not be helped or may be hurt again, so people today have more science and biologycial knowledge and they know hoe to help someone in the danger.
7.0	Therefore, people today have more meoths , knowledge, edcuaction so that the
11.0	Personally,I do not think it is a very good idea for parents to offer their school-aged children money when their children get a high mark.
12.0	Nowadays,more and more children are having a wrong concept of money,and just because of the things like this which is done by their parents,many children are misunderstanding money.
11.0	For me,I have two different reasons why it is a bad thing for their children.
5.0	Firstly,children in school-age should not get in touch with money too early.
8.0	Perhps it is the ideology that is a little bit conservate,but in fact it is true.
8.0	Money is a symbol of substains and also a symbol of desire.
8.0	Nevertheless,the childhood of a child should be pure and naive.
8.0	In this casse ,if a child get in touch with the money too early, it would led him or her ideology into a vert desirble world and te child wuold not be that naive,they would think too much about the connections between their grade and the money hie orher parents give .
8.0	I am not sure if it can even destroy their childhood.
5.0	Secondly,if a child just connest the money with the grade that he or she gains,it would surely let them have a wrong cocept of money .
8.0	What is money?
8.0	Like I have said before ,it is a thing that reoresents the subtance.
8.0	So think about it,is a child does everying insluding the grade depending on the money,how horiible will it be?
8.0	Will this child become a substaincial person since he or she is very young.?
8.0	Ofcourse it could happens and this is the thing that parents can not avoid if their child is having wrong conceptions of money.
8.0	It would certainly lead the child's sense of worth into a wrong place .
1.0	In conclusion,it will bring many disadvantages for a child if he or she is studying just for gaining more money form their parents.
1.0	Again,prsonally,I dont think it is a good idea for parents to offer children money when they get a good grade.
12.0	I disagree with this thought.
8.0	For a start,If you watch a movie on the computer,it is not only bad for your health,but also will make you have a short-sight,I think no one wants to wear glasses everytime,right?
8.0	And,I have a friend named Katherine，she never goes out to execise,If she feels tired,she will watch a movie or read books in her room,and then she lied down on the playground when she was running with us,now she has stayed in the hospital for two weeks.
8.0	The doctor told her it was caused by not execising.
8.0	So according to this tregedy we should do more physical execise.
8.0	Doing physical execise has lots of good courses,for example firstly,It can make people feel relax,when you are tired because of homework,you can running in your neighbourhood,then you will find although you were got all wet,you feel very cool and happy,the sadness was dusted away.
8.0	Secondly,Exercising can make people more beatiful ,healthier and younger.
8.0	"If you keep running every day,your stomache will become""bigger"",and your skin will be more smooth and touchful,If you don't believe me,you can keep doing what I said and then ask a stranger to tell you your age,she/he will tell you your age that younger than your real age!"
8.0	That's amazing,right?
8.0	Believe me,do more physical execise when you want to be relaxed,it is better than reading books or watching a movie in your bedroom,do more outdoor execise,do more physical execise,be more healthier and younger.
3.0	Nowadays, some parents come up with the idea to award their children for getting high grade in school.
3.0	They think it is a way to encourage their children to study harder in school.
11.0	As far as I can see, this kind of action might be effective for a short term, but the influence on children might be negative in long term.
8.0	The children are meant to go to school and study, all the efforts they paid are for themselves, not for money or their parents.
8.0	They are too young to understand that, but parents should lead them to think like that.
8.0	By awarding children money for getting high grades, the kids might think they are studying for the money, and that might change their values.
8.0	The influence is long term, and the impact could be significant.
6.0	Let me give an example, it is like training a dog.
8.0	You are training you dog to sit down, you would award him with a treat when he sits, and several times of training, he would sit once you tell him to.
8.0	That seems good on dogs, but when it comes to humans, the actions you take should be different, since you certainly can not treat a man like a dog.
8.0	When you are taking this awarding actions, the kids are just like the dogs, they are trained to study hard for the awards, not for the knowleges, and once the awards are no longer given, their passion for studying is gone.
2.0	I do admit that the children need encouragement to study hard, because they do not have the passion to study, but we certainly should not transfer their passion to money, that would cause a big changing on their values, and that is not what we want in a long term sight.
10.0	I think we can find other ways to encourage children to study.
3.0	Nowadays the purchase has been a concern for many people and it causes a topic that which factor affects people the most when it comes to a major purchase.
3.0	This debate divdes people with different camps with different opinions, and some people would like to hold the opinion that the information from media or sales man in the market will influnen their purchase the most.
12.0	However, when it comes to me, I consider ercommendations from my friends or colleagues will affect my purchase the most, and there are some reasons and examples that can illustrate my opinions.
5.0	First and foremost, people are likely to trust their frineds more.
8.0	To be more specific, since people have been spending so much time with their frineds, and there are no finacial benifits between them about the recommendations of purchasing, their frineds will be sincere to them and they are more likely to hear their friend's advice.
8.0	In opposition, if people just view the information from media, they will probably get misleaded since the media may perfer them to buy something that people actually don't need at all since the media has to get its own benefits.
8.0	For example, one of my best friends, who likes shop a lot, he will always get information from me since he trusts me that I can tell him whether he really needs to buy this product, and I will be willing to tell him sincerely since it will not bring benefit or cost moeny.
5.0	In the second place, people's friends known what kind of product best fits them.
8.0	This is because that frineds are based on common interest, so they will talk about the same things a lot and get to know more about each other, and their friends know what they like the most and what fit them the most, as a result of this, their friends' advice will always favor them and they will be more likely to turn to their friends for advice.
8.0	In opposition, if people just listen to the salesman in the market, they may buy something that don't fit them at all since the salesman cannot tell what fits them the most and what they like.
8.0	Let's take myself for example, I will talk a lot about clothes with my frineds, so they will get to know what fits me and what I like the most, in this way every time when I turn to me for advice, they can always give me an advice that satisfy me.
0.0	Granted, it may be reasonable and attractive that some people claim that information from media or salesman in the market affects the purchase the most, since the media is everywhere and will easily get people's attention so people will get affected easily, and the salesman has very good speech that can convince people.
0.0	However, it cannot hold water, since people are likely to hear their sincere friends, so after hearing the advice from their friends, they can know for sure what they actually need, so they will neither be affected by the information form media nor the salesman in the market.
0.0	So I am still convinced by my standpoint that the recommendations from my friends can affect purchase the most.
3.0	Nowadays, with the increase of living standards, people pay more attention on education and working.
3.0	In our daily study or wkring life, we will encounter many important decisons to consider about.
3.0	So, take the contraversial problems in our consideration, what is the best solution if the teacher or the meeting leader says something incorrect in your opinion.
3.0	Facd with the tricky condition, different indivuduals have various viewpoints.
3.0	However, from my perspective, I perfer to wait until the class or meting os oer and the people are gone, and then talk to the teacher or meeting leader.
11.0	And my reasons and examples are as follows.
5.0	First of all, listening to the teacher or the meeting leader is a indispensable virture for a student or a employee.
8.0	It is because your behavior represent your own characteristic and personnality.
8.0	So following the teacher or the meeting leader in the public circumstance can convey you are repective to them.
8.0	However, there are another group of people are likey to interrupt and correct the miatake right away thanks to their active thinkingFor instance, my brother was a marketing manage worked at the Google company, hosting a conference last week.
8.0	During the conference, it was his turn to deliver a speech,when he represented his reports to employees, he missed a important details due to carelessness.
8.0	However, there was a worker stood up and pointed out the mistakes under the cirsumstance that everyone at there.
8.0	My brother felt extremely embarrassed and apologize to them.
8.0	Finally, the person was fired because of his impolite manner.
5.0	On top of that, there are some other people will choose to say nothing because they are not willing to make any unneceaasary troubles.
9.0	The behavior seemd like safe and polite, but I think it will produce many bad consequnces bacause the really essential problem is not solved and might even cause terrible outcome.
9.0	What is more, I am strongly believe that waiting until the class or meeting is over and the poeple are gone, and then talk to the teacher or the meeting leader is th best way to solve the problem on acount of polite and effiency.
7.0	Last but not least, waiting until all peole are gone is the best way to solve the p
11.0	Anyway can go to the Rome.
11.0	Nowadays, there are a huge number of ways can achieve goals.
10.0	We can cooperate with our friends and we can depend on our self-ability.
3.0	Which mean is better for success in a future job?
12.0	Having ability to cooperate well with prople or trying your best study in school.
4.0	For me, I put same value on these two kinds of behaviors.
8.0	People gathered together and then form a group, which has lagger energy than one person.
8.0	However, some technology work need high professional skills, which requires high-level professional knowledge.
8.0	In this condition, we need study hard in school in order to get professional skills copping some difficult problems.
4.0	On the one hand, the ability to relate well to people can help us gather more prominent people together.
8.0	Each person has their unique ability and each person has their shortcomming.
8.0	When we gather together, we can overcome a lot of difficulties.
8.0	Take my team as an instance.
8.0	I specialize in economy and some times I can copy with the massive workllord due to the fact that I need to communicate with my consumers and analysis market trend.
8.0	I communicate with my friends and I talk them I hope they can help me and we gather together in the end.
8.0	I needn't copy with problem by myself and our efficiency is improved.
8.0	We achieve success at final.
8.0	Through this experience, I see more value in the ability to relate well to people.
4.0	On the other hand, studying hard in school bring more positive impacts to deal with some work which need high level proffesional skills.
8.0	For instance, my brother's major is computer science and he is really hard working in university, which makes he get a lot of proffesional skills.
8.0	My company want to create a game and all of members can do that.
8.0	At final my brother finish this job by his professional knoledge.
10.0	To sum up, all of these two behavior i
3.0	Some students are recieved pocket money from they parents when they reach a significant mark nowadays,and many people think that is a good method to encourage their children.
11.0	In my opinion,I do not think this is the only way to give them a price,altough I claim it is a good measure.
5.0	Grant students money as a price is a good idea,beacause they are willing to recieve and cost currency at thier ages.
8.0	Juveniles are interested on many goods and services,they want a plenty of items.
8.0	As a result,they prefer money to any other things.
8.0	For example,many electric products ,like Ipones,are the favourate goods,so they are more likely to wark hard and fullfit parents' requrement.
8.0	I think that is the reason why provide school-age children money is a better idea.
5.0	However,there maybe some problems are cost by offer money to them.
8.0	The mainly trouble is that it may lead juveniles crime.
8.0	When once they cannot achieve a high grade,they may feel upset or even irritation,so they are likely to steel their parents or other strangers' money to satisfy their wants.
8.0	In addition,they may be carried into cells and that would have a nagetive influence in their future.
7.0	All in all,to my mind,I believe that give money is a good way,but
3.0	Have you ever seen this phenomenon that youger people are more interested in famous entertainers and athletes?
3.0	Have you ever noticed that the major audiences of a concert hold by a famous singer are always youger people?
3.0	The phenomenon I metioned before can decribe the opinions of celebrities, such as the well-known entertainers and sportsman are more significant to younger generation than they are to older people.
3.0	There are multitude of reasons to explain this kind of phenomenon.
3.0	Firstly, younger generation are more likely to be addictted by those famous people.
11.0	Secondly, younger people have less experience to let them hold their own opinion and do not change by other's statement.
5.0	First of all, because younger people are more in-style, they can get more fashionable things than older people, so they are more interested in these kind of people.
8.0	For instance, nowadays, there are a lot of well-known stars who are very handsome and fashionable, and they have a huge numbers of fans, which are almost teenagers or university students.
8.0	They may care more about those fresh things and those gorgeous people.
8.0	If they are really addictted into these stars, firstly they will follow the trend that the idol has, after that, they will buy the products that the entertainer recommend.
8.0	With the time is going, the opinions of their idols are very significant to them.
5.0	What is more, some of the younger generation who follow the celebrities are under 18, so that they do not have very mature value to judge or analyse those things happened.
8.0	When I was a little girl, if I had something that I can not handle, I would  choose to ask a person who I admired or appreciated for their help.
8.0	If the younger generation are fond of those celebrities, they will consider the opinions from those celebrities very carefully, because they have nothing to do but follow the person that they believe.
8.0	On the other hand, for older people, they may have their own thought and perspective for the things happened surroungding them, so they can handle and deal with it though the experience they have.
2.0	In conclusion, the views of well-known people are more vital to yonnger generation than they are to older people.
3.0	At present, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among students: should people focus on the realistic goals rather than ambitious ones?
3.0	Answers vary from one to another.
11.0	Some people claim that it's more important to set up an ambitious dream.
11.0	However, contrary to their view comes to my own perspective that people should pay more attention to the realistic goals.
11.0	My viewpoint is based on following views.
5.0	First,  we can find methods easily with a realistic goal.
8.0	To be more specific, a realistic target is more concrete and easier to make specific plans to achieve it.
8.0	In this way, by dividing the goals into smaller parts, people can easily handle this small particle one by one with corresponding  method.
8.0	However, if you set up an ambitious goal, you may even not know how to start for everthing is so abstract.
8.0	For example, my brother Jack managed to build up a Internet company after his graduation.
8.0	He made a detailed list that recorded everything he needed to open up a company such as conputers, printers, desks and so on.
8.0	And he also listed up all expenses needed in his notebooks.
8.0	In this way, he converted a difficult task---opening up a company into smaller parts---things he needed, expenses and other stuff, which made the goal more easier to achieve.
5.0	Second, a realistic goal could elevate people's enthusiam.
8.0	Specifically, people usually find a concrete goal more likely to ahieve than an ambitious one for they always think they don't qualify for some extremely hard work but if they are asked to head toward a more specific task, they may be cheered up and then enthusiastic to finish the task.
8.0	Take myself for an example.
8.0	My boss once asked me to hand in the outline of the economic situation of recent years in one week for he will use in the meeting.
8.0	I thought it so hard that the economic situation has included so many aspects and I ecen didn't know where to start.
8.0	After being informed that the outine was used to describe the situation of restaurants, I found more energetic and finished it soon.
2.0	In conlusion, people should focus on the realistic goals rather than ambitious ones for the realistic goals are easier to achieve and can also raise people's enthusiam
3.0	In this fast developing society, education is becoming more and more important.
12.0	Whenever asked about the attitude towards the question that whether parents should allow children make mistakes and let them learn these mistakes, people always exist an air of uncertainty.
11.0	However, I wholeheartedly agree that children should make mistakes and then learn from the mistakes without parents help.
4.0	First, by making mistakes and learn from them without parents' help, children can learn to be independent.
8.0	If parents don't help children when they make mistakes, then children will know that they should depend on themselves because they have no other persons to rely on.
8.0	Therefore, they will try to solve the problems by themselves and learn from the mistakes.
8.0	In this way, they will do the whole process by themselve, and the next time they make mistakes, they will not try to rely on others, they will just learn from the mistakes.
8.0	So, letting children make mistakes and learn from them will help children to be independent.
4.0	Then, letting children make mistakes and learn from them, can let them prepare for the future.
8.0	Children often are kept away from the problems, so they never have the chance to see what the real world is like.
8.0	However, the real world is not as amazing as they think, so by letting them make mistakes, they will get to know that there are a lot of chanllenges in the real world.
8.0	And when they become a member of the society, they will make mistakes.
8.0	So,let them learn from their own mistakes when they are children, they will become used to the future when they enter the society and make mistakes.
8.0	In this way, letting them make mistakes and learn from the mistakes can let them prepare for the future.
4.0	Last but not the least, by letting children make and learn from mistakes, children will understand their parents more.
8.0	Parents alway tell their children what to do and not to do in order to give them a bright future.
8.0	However, children sometimes can not understand that their parents do so because their parents about them.
8.0	So, when children make mistakes without parents suggestion, they will know that parents are right.
8.0	And when they try to learn from their own mistakes, they will not that it is not a easy task.
8.0	Therefore, they will know that what parents said is to to keep them away from mistakes and give them helps.
8.0	So they will undertand their parents.
2.0	To conclude, only if parents let children make and learn from their own mistakes, can children learn to be independent, be prepared for the future and understand their parents.
3.0	Children have a natural instinct,which is called encouragement mechanism.
3.0	They will improve as much as they get.
12.0	Therefore,it's obvious that children need to be couraged by appropriate money.
12.0	Money is not everthing,but it's the simplest reward for a child.
12.0	Unlike toys or prizes,money can be exchanged for anything.
6.0	Many times the reward given by parents is unsatisfactory to the children，so children may feel unworthy of their efforts.
8.0	This will greatly dampen their enthusiasm.
8.0	Giving moneycan also give children enough space to imagine fully.
8.0	they make their own decisions about what they want to cultivate children's selfreliance.
8.0	In a word,although money may bring danger wo cgildren from childhood to secular life,as the saying goes，the children born are like spilled water,and one day they will enter society.
8.0	It's better to prepare early so that they can learn how to distinguish good form bad and have self-determination.
12.0	I do not think people today are more willing to help the struggling strangers.
8.0	Now people are still think it is not safe to talk more with them, especially you are child or a student.
8.0	If you speak too more you will have problem with yourself.
8.0	But I do not think that mean do not help them, you can only answer their question if they ask you where to go.
8.0	They can ask way to adult not a child.
8.0	But, if you change a way.
8.0	Some foreign come to your country, they stay their for a pretty long time, and can not find any way to the place they want.
8.0	You can help them without they asking you.
8.0	They will feel you help him and have a good memering in your city and country.
8.0	The world should be full of love, if you help them, one day, they will return to help you.
8.0	When you help others, you are also improving yourselves.
8.0	Because you want to do better in front of others.
8.0	You can recieve a friendship from other country, if everyone in different countries do this every day.
8.0	We won't have a war anymore, every country are friendly to each other, just like brothers.
11.0	Admittedly, young people today are able to make better decisions about their own lives compared with the previous stage, although it is hard to judge which decision is better or more reasonable, the people today do have better decision making skills.
4.0	Evidently, people have more ways to gain access to the knowledge and information, we are no longer rely on the inderect experiences of our ancestors.
10.0	The development of technology and media give us more channels to collect the data and information we want, according to the analasis of these data, we can weight the pros and cons of each thing, thus making the best decision of ourselves.
4.0	Moreover, in the rapid development of the world, everything is undergoing earthshaking chages at any time, it is hard to recognize the useful and valuable information, which make it harder to form our decision making skills.
9.0	However, we are capable to have deeper understanding of the world in multiple perspectives, while our parents still maintain the old-fasioned thinking patterns.
9.0	Compared with these two kinds of thinking pattern, it turn out that making choices and decisions by our own is a better way suit our own demands and requirements,
4.0	Most importantly, today young people tend to be more independant and progressive compared with the consevative one of their parents.
8.0	They are more likely to shoulder the responsibility of failure by their own and be more courageous and aggresive when dealing with decision making tasks.
8.0	Having believed that they are born to be individule who is obliged to have better command of their own lives, they according show better capacity to make individule decision.
8.0	This is the characteristics that their parents don't have.
2.0	Above all, it does not really matter how to make decisions better, what's more important is that the young people have the ability to analyze the problems by their own and make more reasonable and acceptable decisions.
3.0	Some parents give their child some money or gifts when their child gets high grade.
3.0	Actully,this problem is more and more popular in China.
11.0	And I think it is not the best way for child.
5.0	I read a story when I was a teenager.
8.0	In that story,a daughter was really clever,and smart,so she was No.1 in every exam,her father gave her 100 RMB when her achieved first No.1,and then when she achieve the No.1,she was find her father and let him for money.
8.0	And the money was improve with her age.
8.0	But the daughter was never be kind of his father,she think her father was her ATM.
8.0	How is a shocked story?
5.0	So I think it is not a good way to insprie them.
8.0	So many parents will not have many time to take care of their child,so when their kids achieve high grides,they want use this way to insprie them.
8.0	I think child is not need to money,they are aware of love,they are rely to their parents,not is money.
8.0	And this bad way will tell them,you can spend money for everywhere,you can use it in some bad place,buy some bad things.
8.0	they can't control theirselves,and don't do more homework.
7.0	So I hope more and more parents will not only inspire their child but also will
3.0	In this day and age, a huge number of events involved juvenile deliquency from school bullying to campus violence are emerging.
3.0	Hence, a favorable method to handle these tricky problems is extremely demaned.
3.0	And there are many various measures are proposed, many citizens assert that the most efficient way is to supervise and monitor children, and others contends that parents are supposed to limit the types of the pograms and movies.
3.0	However, I have a profound conviction that the ideal approach for parents is to accompany with their children.
4.0	First of all, children's many false beviour occure due to the lacked commucation.
8.0	This is because if kids can obtain a valuable opportunity convey their thoughts to others, childeren will perfrom better with parent's guide.
8.0	To illustrate, never will the passage of time gnaw away my memory.
8.0	When I was young, my parents were busy with their work.
8.0	That is to say, they only said less than 5 sentences to me every week Thereby, in order to lead my parents pay more attention on me and create more chance to commuciate with me.
8.0	I always fighted with other children and participated in school shooting.
8.0	Had my parents been willing to spend more time talking with me, I would have not acted badly.
4.0	On top of that.
8.0	the approach to limit the types of the TV programs and movies children watch is incorrect, since it is likely to stifle children's creativity and innovation.
8.0	Fo instance, there are many knowledge on the TV programs or movies that adloescents could obtain.
8.0	With the help of these knowledge, it is extremely for them to creative many interesting items.
4.0	Last but not the least, it is time-consuming for parents to supervise and monitor children while they are playing others.
10.0	In addition, once the method is implemented, parents are hardly to work in their regular time.
2.0	In conclusion, I believe that parents should spend time with children.
3.0	Do you think these successful people will try new things and take risks?
3.0	Do you think someone only do what they already know would not be successful?
11.0	The answer is these people who try new things and risks will gain success.
12.0	This is because, the higher risks and the higher profit.
11.0	Moreover, the world changes everyday so if we  do not try some new things, we will be gaven up by the society.
5.0	Firstly, if we want to make more money than other, we must try something new and take risks.
8.0	Take my brother as an example, he is professional in the business.
8.0	But when he graduates, he found a job which is about computer science.
8.0	Every people around him think that he makes a big mistake because he found the job he is not profession on.
8.0	However the retaining part of the story is very superising.
8.0	He have been study the computer science during the rest time.
8.0	This crazy and dearing choice brings him a lot of benefites; he found that he is good at the computer science, can do a lot of programms that others cannot do.
8.0	Eventually, he set up a computer company and he can gain a lot of money.
8.0	I think all of these come from my brother try new things and take risks.
8.0	If he did not try the computer science, he would never know he was a genious about this field.
5.0	Secondly, with the develpoment of the society if we want to do things that we have already know how to do well better than before, we must gain some new information form the world.
8.0	For instance, my uncle has several  reptails, and during the former decade these reptails bring a lot of benefit to him.
8.0	Unfortrunately, with the develpoment of the website shopping his business became worse and worse.
8.0	So he decides to try some new things; he open several retails and translate them to the Internet.
8.0	He also meet a lot of problem and this was a big risk for him.
8.0	But finally he solve all these problem.
3.0	In our competetive life, there are more and more cooperation existing in the society.
3.0	And certainly, the leader of a team plays an importanta role in working.
3.0	Here comes a question.
3.0	Some people think a team leader should listen to the advice of the members, while others think they should not.
12.0	In my opinion, I insist a team leader is supposed to listen to its members.
4.0	First, listening to members of the team can help to create more ideas which may be more creative and effective.
8.0	I have to admit that most leaders are more capable and smart, but it does not mean they are always the best.
8.0	This makes me think of an experience of mine.
8.0	When I was in high school, I thought I had a great idea to solve the math question facing a difficult question.
8.0	As I was the leader of the group, I wanted to answer the teacher for the first one, so I did not discuss with mt group members.
8.0	Unfortunately, after my answering, other group gave a better answer which have be thought of by one of my group member.
8.0	It was a pity that I did not listen to my team members.
4.0	Secondly, listening to other is a kind of communication, which can makes the circumustance of the team more friendly.
8.0	And most member are willing to try their best, which means they can improve the efficiency of the team work.
8.0	Once I was engaged in a electronic device competetion, and my group did not make any progress but discussing, and that made me very nervious about the contest.
8.0	But my team leader insisted to listen to members about the idea such as conducting methods, designing plan, and time arranging.
8.0	And all of my team members are willing to give their suggestions.
8.0	Altough we did not do much at the first stage, I find we beyonded other team suprisingly at last.
8.0	That made me realize listening to members can aviod many problems which is much harder to solve in the following stage.
4.0	Thirdly, there is no doubt that making decision without listening to members can be more efficient sometimes.
8.0	Because there are so many things which is emergency, the team leader have no time discussing with the group.
8.0	However, the leader often just think it is not necessary to have a communication.
8.0	In order to deal with this problem, I think leaders should hold regular meeting to listen to their members.
8.0	In this case, the leader do not need to listening to others in some special situations.
2.0	And finally, listening to members are so important that a team may be destoried by the lack of communication.
10.0	So listening is very significat,
11.0	My opinion is that I disagree this statement.
5.0	In morden generation,people's knowledges and culture instantly expandance.
8.0	The requirement of art is more nessessary to humen beings.
8.0	They were long for more authemetic things to inpact themself.
8.0	This could be a positive penomenon.
8.0	But more and more people  play with thier mobile phone or computer all the day,evenly without eating and sleeping.
5.0	The report claimed that more and more young people and teenagers have eyes and backbones disease.
8.0	In the street,elemantory sdudents with glasses everywhere.
8.0	Their daily life is only to play and study.
8.0	Threfore,thier body have not sport and exercise in long-term.
8.0	They will be easy to get fever or cold.
0.0	I think the morden people should do appropriate exercise several a week,just for their physisal body.
0.0	Watching a movie and reading book are good habbies.
0.0	But everything have limitation,and can not excess.
12.0	In my opinion,it is better to do some physical exercise.
8.0	There are many reasons contribute to this point.
8.0	It is a pleasant way to relax by watching movie or reading a book,but the way seperates us with people.
8.0	And some teamwork physical exercise  are beneficial to our life.
8.0	While doing physical exercise, I am beyond the pressure from  the work and the study.
8.0	I am a member of our school basketballteam.
8.0	When I am engaged in team training,surrounded by friends,we comunicate in pleasure,talking about daily affairs.
8.0	These simple actions promote our friendship.
8.0	What's more,anticipating in some comepetions definetly enlarge my social circles.
8.0	It wil create enomors opptunities to know  different people.
6.0	The pressure is sometimes physically,or mentally.
8.0	Compared with watching a movie or reading a book,that only realse the pressure from mentally,physical exercise both improve our physical and mental statement.
8.0	In one study,a chenmical releases when people are doing physical exercise.
8.0	Which stimulates our neural system to promote a statement of happienies.
8.0	The sweat ,although sometimes annoying,is beneficial to our health.
7.0	The exercise also prolong our life according to some studies
3.0	Recently, an interesting question has aroused a heated debate among people: whether teachers should be paid at least as much as doctors, lawyers or business leaders or not.
3.0	Some people hold the idea that it is not reasonable to give teachers as least the same salary as doctors, lawyers or business leaders.
11.0	However, as far as I am concerned, teachers should be paid more salary.
12.0	My point will be illustrated as follows.
5.0	First of all, teachers,who make a significant part of society, deserve a good salary.
8.0	As is known to all, education is the foundamention of a society, and teachers are the independable part of education.
8.0	It means that the quanlity of teachers determines a country's future.
8.0	They are as important as doctors,lawyers or business leaders to the society.
8.0	Thus we need to give those good salary to them to represent their importance and encourage them to do better.
8.0	I can remeber that my uncle was a math teacher in high school.
8.0	He used to get nearly 5000 a month three years ago and he always felt bored about the job, nevertheless, his salary raised to 10000 because of the educational reform.
8.0	And since then, he put more energy in teaching and felt it stimulating, eventually he became a good teacher in the school.
5.0	Becides, increasing the teachers' salary can encourage more people to become a teacher, which can ease the educational pressure where there are few teachers in some poor regions.
9.0	China still has some really poor villages, and youngsters would not like to go there because of the tough environment and low salary.
9.0	Nevertheless, if the government can increase the teachers' salary to as least as much as doctors, lawyers of business leaders, I believe there must be more people would like to be teachers in those areas.
2.0	To put it in a nutshell, I agree with the idea that teachers should be paid more and at least as much as doctors, lawyers or business leaders.
3.0	Recently an interesting statement aroused among people :teachers should be paid at least as much as doctors,lawyers or business leaders are paid.
3.0	Different people has different views about it.
11.0	As for me,I strongly disagree this statement, there are some reasons to spport my viewpoint.
5.0	firstly, teachers' working requirement is not higher than doctors'working, lawyers'working and so on.
8.0	as we all know, being a teacher is a stable working career and teachers should not suffer from rapid working pace and work pressure like a doctor.
8.0	Being a teacher, you just accomplish class course and check students'assignments.
8.0	Besides,teacher can spend much time in enjoying entertainment rather than working overtime.
8.0	for example, my father is a doctor and my mother is a teacher.
8.0	I always accompany with my mother on my weekends without my father.
8.0	Because his work is so busy that he cannot play with me.
8.0	But my moher,as a teacher,she cannot go to school to teach on her spare time.
5.0	In addition, the salary of teachers are offered by government and other jobs will be affected external environment.
8.0	Even though the students cannot get good grades in final exam, their teachers also can get the same salary .
8.0	In other words, their acception do not have influence of students' learning attitudes or grades.
8.0	in contrast, as a doctor,if your patient does not feel satisfied about your medical ways or healing ways.
8.0	If he told his annoy to your boss, and you will suffer from some blame from your boss.
8.0	Even your payment will be decreased.
8.0	For instrance, my aunt is also a teacher like my mother.
8.0	She just check the homework and teach class every weekdays.
8.0	Although her students do not get good grades in final exam, she never get blame from her boss.
8.0	She still enjoy five- day working time instead of wroking on weekends.
1.0	To put in a nutshell, I do not think that teachers should be paid as least as much as doctors,lawyers or business leaders are paid.
1.0	Not only teacher cannot suffer from unstable wroking speed, but also cannot be influenced payment every month although their students cannot be rank the first.
7.0	So I do not a
3.0	When it comes to the issue whether parents would better to offer their children money as a reward for good grades, perspectives vary from person to person.
12.0	Some people believe that it is not a good idea since chilren may use money to buy unhealthy food and game machines.
12.0	Nevertheless, in my opinion, parents regard money as a reward for high makes brings a lot of advantages.
5.0	To begin with, money can motivate children to study harder.
9.0	Once children have tasted the sweetness of getting money after they have high grades in school, they will want to earn money again.
9.0	Then they will find studying harder is the only way leading to good grades, which becomes a motivation for students to pay more attention during the class and do homework carefully after school.
5.0	In addition, it is a good chance to teach children how to use money.
9.0	If a child did not have the experience of using money, it won't be good for his or her futher.
9.0	Once he or she get the salary in work, he o
2.0	In summar, from what have been mentioned above, we can conclude that it is a good idea that parents gives their children money for each high mark.
11.0	Recently, a topic has aroused a heated debate: whether movies and television have more negative effects than positive effects on the young people's behavior.
11.0	Some people think that negative effects really are more than positive effects on adolescents' behavior, however, I think the positive effects are more than negative effects as long as their watching shows are controlled by their parents well.
5.0	To begin with, movies and television programs can bring young people more knowledge that cannot be learned from books.
8.0	Parents can let their children watch movies and television when they are around them, so that they can control what the children are watching.
8.0	Many TV program--like Animal Kingdom, Get Close to Science, and CCTV News--are of great value for children to get knowledge.
8.0	These knowledge can cultivate the students' ability of critical thinking, which is helpful for them when they are having Politics, Biology and Science class at school.
8.0	For example, my cousin usually watched Animal Kingdom when he was young, and he was really interested in playing with animals, so he was familiar with animals' habits.
8.0	When he attended middle school, he was able to understand all of the knowledge which was shown in the Biology text book.
8.0	Thanks to the TV show, his biology score ranked the first in his class.
5.0	Moreover, with the development of the technology, parents do not need to worry about their children's addiction to movies and television.
9.0	The parents can set a time to close the televisions and several specific TV programs on the televisions, which will make their children watch TV in a limited time and watch only beneficial programs.
9.0	Closing TV on time can cultivate the children's sense of time, and they will go to
10.0	From what has been mentione above, we can draw
3.0	Have you ever felt that the noise of the car around your neighbourhood is too loud that you cannot enjoy your beautiful weekend?
3.0	Have you ever felt that it is more difficult to inhale the fresh air in your country?
3.0	As the development of technology, more people imagine and start to believe that there will be fewer cars in use after twenty years.
12.0	Neverthelees, I still believe that the usage rate of car will not reduce in twenty years.
5.0	On top of that, car is indispensible.
8.0	When we own a car, we can go to anywhere we want, and stop by anywhere we like.
8.0	However, if people go out by public transit,  they should go to the limited stop station and wait the transportation to come.
8.0	Therefore, car is really important in our daily life, because we have no need to go to a far place, and it is more convienent if we own a car.
5.0	In addtion, scientists are now try to optimize the cars instead of discard the car.
8.0	After all, there are many benefits about cars, and it is hard to devise a new product to replace the cars, it needs time- consuming and money- consuming.
8.0	We need to find method to resolve the noise problem, air problem and the resource problem which were caused by cars.
8.0	To illustrates, scientists have invented some new instruments to disappear the noise which may have an influence on the neighbourhood, and clean the atmosphere which is gived off by car.
10.0	Therefore, I think the usage of car will no
3.0	With the development of the economy, parents nowadays are more and more concerned about their children's education.
3.0	Some may even give their children pocket money as children get get high grade in the exam.
11.0	From my point of view, i don't think it is good way to motivate children to study hard.
5.0	First of all, giving money to praise their good grades may make children to spend money uncorrectly.
8.0	Since children are still young, they can't manage their money very well as adults since their self-dicipline are weak.
8.0	As a result, they could use the money they gained as long as they can but the things they buy may be useless.
8.0	If parents don't teach them how to manage their money, then they may have trouble on spending money which can influnce their life.
5.0	Secondly, the personality of children may be influenced.
8.0	Through this way, children would see studying as learning money instead of learninf for themselves.
8.0	And they can't gain interest and satisfying from studying itself.
8.0	What's more, they may even learn to cheat in the exam.
8.0	For if they really want to earn that money, they will use every method without thinking.
8.0	And the bad habbit will go with him as he go to work.
10.0	Last but not
12.0	I can't choose agreeor disagree whith the following statement.
12.0	Because I can't understand what this question means.
8.0	In the past，young people depended too much on  their parents to make decisions for them ; today young people are better able tomake decisions about their own lives.
8.0	I think along time , I think a answer to myself .
8.0	I think young people  will better able to make dedcisions about their own lives.
8.0	Fristly， In our daylife we always study with all things and evertime ，in that time we learned more and more important things，and we will became better able to make decisions about their own lives.
8.0	such as play the basketball ，if you play the basketball everyday ,you will  played more and more better .
8.0	If you keep play the basketball one day one
3.0	Have a glimpse on younger and youth today, they have better education, they have more thinking-free parents, they have better cognitive ability.
12.0	Due to these points, I belive that young people today can make critical decision independently well.
4.0	In the first place, parents nowaday prefer respecting their children's own opinion.
8.0	It is known that, young people should followed their parents blindly in the past as the parents' opinion in the past were highly limited.
8.0	Take myself as an instance, my grandfather is a official and he allowed my father became a official because my grandfather thought that he paved a lighting way for my father already.
8.0	In the fact, my father was going to be an egineering when he was a young boy.
8.0	However, my mother is different due to the fact that her generation's people is more emotion free.
8.0	My father is a lawyer and she told me that if I want to a lawyer in the fether, she can pave the way for my.
8.0	I want to a computer worker and I told her this opinion and she is delighted for me  since she thought that I need follow my heart.
4.0	In the second place, the young boy now is have better education so they have their own direction toward the future.
8.0	For instance, my brother, Tom, want to be an engineering in the futher as he indulged in the sciences when he studied in the university.
8.0	He always had interaction with his professor and he thought about the professor's feedback.
8.0	He told me that he want gain a thought-provoking job in the futher like engineering due the the fact that he like science and he like thinking.
8.0	I learn that today children have their own ideal about futher due to the point that they have a excellent education from my brother Tom.
4.0	Finally, some people think that young people face more influene on the deciding about their futher due to the fact that we live in this time of information explotion and we face too much information and to much suggestion.
9.0	However, I disagree with this poin because I think there information and suggestions bring positive impacts on deciding our futher by ourselves.
9.0	We can ensure our direction about the futher by absorbing these information and suggestions.
2.0	To sum, I supprot this opinion that we can make critical decisions about our futher by ourselves owing to we have more knowledge, we are more free and we can get more help from this society.
3.0	It's vrey common nowadays that  parents reward their kids with money, usually for good performance at school, because they think it can motivate and dirve their kids to face those eldless homework and boring class.
3.0	But, is this a really good idea?
11.0	I doubt it very much.
5.0	First, using money as reward will make kids feel that study is a kind of goods exchange, which is harmful for their value about study.
8.0	Once kids realize that they can earn money just by studying and getting good grades, they will begin to take study as a kind of job--parents are the bosses, and they are the employees.
8.0	"Then they will study hard for profits and ""salary"" instead of knowlegy and skill."
8.0	In that way, study becomes a burden and task for them.
8.0	They won't get the true meaning and goal of study.
8.0	But in fact, study is for their own benefit and it's a good preparation for their life.
5.0	Besides, getting money as reward will lead the kids to become more material.
8.0	They will think that money is more important than anything else because their parents' behavior indicated that.
8.0	"Situations as follows may happen as time goes by: when you ask your son to fetch today's newspaper for you, he will imediately reply ""one dollar""; when you ask him to wash dishes or sweep the floor, he may answer:  "" You have to pay me""."
8.0	How horrible it is!
8.0	School kids tend to be influenced easily by their surroundings, especially the behavior of their parents.
8.0	So good expample is more important than the results.
0.0	Finally.
0.0	I think this kind of stratedy or tactics has represented the deep concern or worry of parents.
0.0	They care too much about their kids' grades and rank.
0.0	They have tried many ways to push or force kids to get good grades but failed.
0.0	So money as reward become an alternative choice for them, although they known it maybe unwise.
0.0	As I see, the best way to encourage your kids is communication and praise.
3.0	From my perspective, I strongly believe the statement that relating well to people is more crucial than studing hard in school.
5.0	First and foremost, most of jobs in modern society require your social network.
8.0	Take my cousin as an example.
8.0	My cousin who has been working in marketing field for 5 years longer has to socialize with different sort of people.
8.0	Hence, those people in her social network will introduce her to some potential customers who her friends get along with well.
8.0	Gradually, her worked better and get more promotion than other collegues who lack of relatively rich social relationhips.
5.0	In addition, cultivating the capatity to interact with others sometimes bring you efficiency when you are working in a group.
8.0	My classmate Kay's eloquence is quiet outstanding.
8.0	She was required to be a hoster and take part in a group in order to prepare a show.
8.0	As you know, prepating a show need to negotiate with members about when, where and what they should do.
8.0	Many group members did not willing to do those exhuasted works such as wiping a floor,etc.
8.0	Therefore, Kay began to perusade them by illustrating series of benifits of doing this work and shortcomings of counterpart.
8.0	Soon, all the members compromised and accepted her arrangement.
0.0	It's true that studying hard has its advantages.
0.0	Such as you can handle with different kinds of  harships and won't get nervous when you confront some difficulties in real life.
0.0	However, if we alway study hard may lose oppotunities to meet new friends.
0.0	We need friend to enrich our life.
3.0	Personally speaking, I will support this statement for 100 percent.
3.0	Why?
3.0	Some opposing people prefer to say that how efficient and useful transportatio the cars are!
3.0	Nevertheless, I will tell you the cars that will use less and less in later years, and there are many points below this paragraph from my perceive.
4.0	As we know, tons of successful person prefer to buy beatiful cars in order to show how greatful they are.
8.0	However, these cars obviously will be high money consuming, so most of the consumers prefer to get these cars as some collections rather than using them.
8.0	For instance, if you are a great man with amout of wonderful cars, and drives them every day which will hurt them easily aand need expensive oil fees.
8.0	Would you still want to use them every day?
4.0	In additionally, environment has got wrosen recently, there is no doubt that the weather will become bad in future.
8.0	Thus, more and more people prefer to choose some environment friendly transportation as a major using.
8.0	In this regard, more and more sharing bikes occured recently, which will produce less pollution to the environment, also have a reasonable price for the citizen.
8.0	The government has pubulished a new policy, which will limit the cars'numbers.
4.0	At last, the cars will not be efficient any more.
8.0	the planes and metres can totally replace the cars in any fields.
8.0	For example, we can travel long distance to another city by airport.
8.0	In the native city, the subway is the first choice for anyone  , which is more cheap and more fast.
10.0	In conclude, there is no car in futu
3.0	Recently, an interesting discussion about whether people will spend less time cooking and preparing foods in twenty years than they do today.
3.0	some people agree with this statement that it is necessary for people to spend less time in cooking and preparing foods in twenty years than they do today.
11.0	As for me, I disagree with the statement that people will spend less time cooking and preparing foods in twenty years than they do today.
11.0	There are some reasons th support my viewpoint.
5.0	first of all, cooking is a basical skill that everyone should master, so we should not ignore it and spend much time in cooking.
8.0	as we all know, when we were young, we can not cook and prepare the food because of study and we regard it as parents' mission.
8.0	Actually, it is a misunderstanding for us to forget   the importance of cooking.
8.0	Everyone will face the life alone without parents.
8.0	in other words,we should cook foods for ourselves in the future.
8.0	so we should spend much time in cooking in twent years rather than ignoring it.
8.0	for example, my brother Tom can not cook because he thinks that what he is doing such as study is most important thing than others includes cooking.
8.0	But next month,he will have to live alone when he gradauates from his uniersity.
8.0	His mother find a new house for him and does not cook for him any more.
8.0	he has to learn cooking now because he needs to master cooking skill that can make him survive.
5.0	in addition,we should take much time to cook because we can make sure the food that we will eat is safe and healthy.
8.0	according to recent reports, we can find that there are many bad news about toxic foods that it caused death of humans.
8.0	As we all know that food security is a major problem for every country.
8.0	If we dcrease the time of cooking, we just buy the food that other persons did in the supermarket or stores.
8.0	It cannot make sure that the food is safe that we ate it and will not feel sick.
8.0	So if we do it by ourselves, even though it will take our much time, we will not be affarid of food problem.
8.0	for instance, my sisiter Lucy ate some dumplings being brought in a small store.
8.0	she felt stamoache in this night and my aunt sent her to the local hospital quickly.
8.0	it is  caused by the dumplings
2.0	to put it into a nutshell, I do not think that people will spend less time in cooking and preparing foods in twenty years than they do today.
7.0	Not only the cookingis a basic skill  that we should master, but also
3.0	There is a tendancy that people today have more chance to connct with outside world because of the existence of Internet and also to meet more strangers.
3.0	However, are people more willing to give a hand to help struggling strangers?
12.0	Acturally, UI really doubt this point.
11.0	The mnore information people can receive today, the more they careful they are than brfore due to the more complicated people they will meet.
4.0	First of all, people tend to be cold and untouched nowdays with the information they receive becoming numerous because the untrustness.
8.0	Many people get used to broswing pages or wechat, weibo to gain outside world information.
8.0	The screen at this end cannot know wether the information at the other end is solid enough or just a trap to deceive net citizens for more money.
8.0	Althougth many people may repost weibo reporting severe condition about struggling strangers and ask for more danation, a lot more people may not donate because the lack of trustness about these struggling strangers.
4.0	Then, report about someone who helps others kindly but  accused to be the crimes by the one he helps get the public heartbroken.
8.0	There is a good saying read a bad news travels faster than the good one.
8.0	People are easier to rememer negtive news than the positive.
8.0	There is a news that has shocked the whole society.
8.0	A knid young man helps a old lady stand up when he finds she lie on the road after being crashed by a motor.
8.0	Hopwever, the old lady claims it is the kind man that hurts her down to the road because she can not find the real vitim and get no funds from him.
8.0	She too wants money  regardless of the truth.
8.0	The event has a significant nagative influence for the sociey.
8.0	After that, the public are harder to give hands to others, especially to a total strangers.
4.0	Thirdly, more resources are private now.
8.0	It may takes more to help others compared to invest these to themselves.
8.0	They may think struggling people can look upon on the help from red cross or other charity foundations because more and more charity foundation exists now.
8.0	People are easy to get rid of their own responsibility to the socitey espercially to the struggling strangers.
0.0	Admittedly, it is traditional virtue to do a favor to those struggling sterangers.
0.0	However, with the time going by, more and more people care themselves first.
0.0	There are a lot uncertain indexs to help atruggling strangers concerning the complexity of human-being minds.
0.0	They choose to avoid helping others but to do more for themselves.
3.0	In contemporary society, education plays apivotal role in individual development.
3.0	It is universally acknowledged that thesolution to adult problems tomorrow depends on enlarged measure upon how our children grow up today.
3.0	Teacher, as one of the key determinant of education success, can impart knowledg, instill high moral values and give inspiration to students.
3.0	The performance of students can mirror teacher's value to some degree.
12.0	However, in my opinion, the salaries of teachers shouldn't be basedmerely on how students perform.
5.0	First and formost, considering a teacher's teaching ability is based on the performance from students is unfair to the teachers who always considerate and a hard-working front-line worker.
8.0	Just thinking about all the groups to be composed of students who are impossible to have exactly same academic abilities and same levels of intellectuality.
8.0	Apparently, once a teacher who is hard-working but all ocated to a class of students who are low-skilled and need time to digest the information and knowledge they learned, it is not difficult to imagine the result that their average scores may not be called excellent.
8.0	Also, in this situation, sometimes certain students would like to absent of classes.
8.0	Therefore, how ridiculous it would be if we negate all the teacher's ability and every effort only because of their students.
5.0	Additionally, teachers' pament is based on their students' performance in school is easily result in a sense of competition that is abnormal.
8.0	In this way, teachers surely tend to neglect the nature of teaching young individuals.
8.0	At the same time, students' performances have become a way of making money and gain teachers' reputation.
8.0	Obviously, this way that is deviate from the principle of education and childcentered learning.
2.0	I admit that estimating teachers based on students performance is possibly resulted in teachers perform their full potential.
7.0	Yet this alone canot
3.0	Have you ever been sarve and could not find snakes?
3.0	Have your parents token you abroad for trevaling?
3.0	I can find snakes all the time.
3.0	And when I have a holiday, my parents always take me out for trevaling.
3.0	But when my grandparents were children, they needed to study and help their parents to grow corps.
3.0	They did not have any time to have fun.
11.0	Thereby, I think we have a easier and more comfortable life today.
10.0	Moreover, there are two specific facets why I think in this way.
5.0	Initially, I think the insurficient food make grandparents childhood much more difficult.
8.0	This is because food can provide energy that we need, and insurficient food made them work hard but without enough ernergy.
8.0	"For instance, my grandparents told me "" When we were children, we had to help our parents in the spring."
8.0	This is because, at that time, our parents were to busy to take care of us and to finish their work, growing corps.
8.0	And we needed to help them in hungey.
8.0	"There are not enough food, and we have ate the roots or barks of trees."""
8.0	Therefore, I think they had a difficult life without food when they were children.
5.0	Moreover, our life are more comfortable because we can relax ourselves.
8.0	We can treval to have fun, and trevaling make us enjoy our life.
8.0	But my grandparents had never trevaled when they were children.
8.0	"They said "" If we can go to the other countryard, we will be happy overnight."""
8.0	They did not have any time to travel and have fun.
8.0	Thereby, I think our life today is more comfortable then it was when my grandparents were chilsren.
0.0	Even though our environment is worse then before, I still think we can solve it one day.
0.0	Although the scences are beautiful before, they did not have any time to enjoy it.
0.0	Taking account of the factors, I think the life is much easier an
12.0	In my opinion I prefer two students work together.
11.0	Beause they can get the information more perfictly.
5.0	Maybe work alone is ok but when two people work together they can express their's opinion together, and their's project will be more perfictly than the person who works alone.
10.0	Although you have known more effectively, but group works will let you know more about it.
5.0	Only one person can not done the things extremely good, also some animals need to worlk in groups.
8.0	Only one lions can not catch an elephant, because it is too hazardouse for it to kill an elephant.
8.0	But a groups of lions can catch an elephant easily.
8.0	The power of groups work is extremely huge.
8.0	So human needs to work together too.
8.0	That may help us when we work together.
2.0	When more people working together the power will be huge, you can not inmagine how huge they are.
10.0	When you work with other people, you may learn more things such as: first the more tings you can know about this projuct; second  you can learn some good habits from your group members; third you can make more friends because of work in groups.
7.0	That is much help us, so work in groups is
3.0	These days, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debated among people: whether government should hire more police to improve the safety to attract tourist.
3.0	Some claims that the safety if the base so this action is necessary, others shows that government should pay more attention on other aspects.
11.0	Opinions vary from person to person.
11.0	From my perspective,  My point will be elaborated as follows.
5.0	Firstly, government should concentrate more on the environment and the protection on the scenic area to attract the tourists.
8.0	The main propuse of the travel is to appreciate the beautiful landscape and experience the local culture, so protect the scenery should be the top priority of the government.
8.0	Only if the environment can give the tourists a relaxing atmosphere, can more people come and experience it.
8.0	On the countrary, although the safety issue can be guranteed by the police, the dirty environment an d the none typical landscape would have no attraction to the tourists.
8.0	For example, I went to Hawaii last summer, though i know that i would never suffer from robbary or other crime，the dirty beach and rubbish on the seaside left a bad impression on me, and also the sea is not as blue as the describition in the advertisment.
8.0	Consequently, I made a early termination of my vacation.
5.0	Secondly, the friendly attitude and the warm welcom of  local people can play an important role in attracting tourists.
8.0	Receiving a warm welcome, people would keep a high spirits and would pay more attention to admire the culture and the scenery.
8.0	On the other hand, imaging that if the travelers are heated by the local people or received a bad service, they wouldnot come back again.
8.0	For example, my roommates went to Japen last year, he received fine services with waiters take care of his daily life including the schedual of breakfast and dinner, and also the landscape he should visit on each day of his trip.
8.0	Opposite to the last country he visited: India, where the local people think that his trip have a bad influence on their daily life, he spent more time on Japon.
2.0	All in all, government can pay more attention on other aspects to attract people.
12.0	It is undenible that parents should teach their children, however, the problem is which way is a best chioce for them to impart knowledge to their children.
12.0	From my prospective, I agree with the point that parents need let children make mistake and let then learn from their own mistakes.
12.0	Also, beside this mentioned above, a lot more should be done by parents, telling their children the reasons why they have done wrong and why they should fix it.
5.0	First, the reason why parents should let children make mistake is obvious that children should not be trapped, while they have their own chioce to do what they want.
8.0	As a human nature, children are free to choose and think, that is of great importance to their growth and mental improvement.
8.0	While they make their own mistake, they are able to bear the result from what they have done.
8.0	And unceasingly, they will find the rule about what they should do and what they should not, as a self-awareness growth which is a positive significance for children.
5.0	Then, not only parents should let their children make mistakes and learn from it by their own, but also a nessesary instruction need to be done by parents.
8.0	As a matter of fact, many children indeed have made many mistake, however, sometimes, they are not able to solute the problems by their own, when they are faced with big trouble.
8.0	That situations need the participation of parents, who play an important role on this sense.
8.0	Take the learning ride as an example, when a child is falling from the bike, parents is surely able to encourage their child to be confident and do it once again, and parents can let he know which point should be paid more attention duiring the ride time, such as keeping the balance or so.
8.0	In that way, this child will definitely do better.
1.0	Therefore, taking everything mentioned above, parents is overwhelmingly responsible for the children's growing states.
1.0	And they not ony need to lat children make mistakes and let them learn from theit own mistakes, but also need to give the right instruction to them.
11.0	In my opinion, I agree this statement that societies today expect young people to follow and abey are too stressful.
11.0	Properly considering, young people are the future of the societies.
12.0	If we take a strict principle on them and warn them to obey some so strict rules, I can help considering what will happen in the future world under the pressure.
6.0	To begin with, I want to take an example for this topic that we had not any creative ideas for any thing in the past, especially during the period of the dynasty under the emperior took control.
8.0	During that time, the young people's life was controled by parents.
8.0	If they didn't listen their parents, they would get beaten by their parents.
8.0	Moreover, their parents might claim that he or she would be their children no longer to persuade them to obey the rules the parents decided.
8.0	Young people couldn't have any creative ideas under this strict principals.
8.0	According to this experience of histroy, young people should get rid of the strings the society decideds to welcome the exlabelty to create the new brain to construct the more beautiful society.
2.0	Then, to support the illusion of my opinion, I want to pick a little thing about myself to tell the importance of this point.
8.0	When I was in the middle school, the school and the teacher will took many measures to control our behaviors to get us study better, including the spare time.
8.0	So, we couldn't sleep enough time to keep up with the study.
8.0	After this radiculors measure, school decided give us more than two hours for the sleep during the noon.
8.0	At last, most of us in this school get better scores than other schools.
3.0	With the development of education, high acedemicachievement become increasingly importent for student.
3.0	Nwadays, in order to encourage children studying harder, many parents use money to reward their children.
11.0	However, some prople do not agree this method is a good idea to make student to hard work.
11.0	In my view, i agree with the statement that money reward is a good idea.
5.0	First of all, the students may be disturb by the money and  no enough concentration in study.
8.0	When the students recieve the money, they could buy anything they want, such as game, video or music.
8.0	In this case, they are likely to spend most time on those entertainment.
8.0	As the result , they do not have enough time focus on school's class, and the worst thing is that they will stay up late to playing games or watching videos, that would be serious problem cause they will sleep during class, adn also harmful to young children's phsical health.
8.0	Therefore, parents should consider that how much reward they give to their children,and check that how they spend those money.
5.0	Nevertheless, offering money can be encouraging student's study efficiently.
8.0	Acturally, money reward is a really use way to encourage in many different regions, the employees in company could be a great example.
8.0	Same for students, normally they don't have much money when they go to school, they may want something they find on the store, but the little bit high price stop their step.
8.0	In order to buy this good, they will hard work on their homework and test, because they make the high marks as their target.
8.0	As the result, they get high grade at test, and they can use the money to buy the good they want.
10.0	In addition, this method can help stu
12.0	When people getting more and more concerned about the students' appearences, they may first concern about the style that the teacher guide them to study.
12.0	I think it's wise for the teacher to let the students solve assign projects with team work, because it will get more efficiency among them.
12.0	When students work alone on projects, this situation will cause some disadvantages.
12.0	So I agree with the idea that the students learn much more effectively when they work together.
5.0	First, when students study together, it can be more quicker to get a solution.
8.0	They can discuss, write, think and make a brainstorm, every one will give an idea and get lots of different ideas.
8.0	So they can make the work effectively.
8.0	To illustrate, my teacher used to asked us a question, and the question was so complex that no one could solve it.
8.0	So some of us talked together to gave out our ideas, and the question was solved in the end.
8.0	If we worked alone, we might use lots of time but  miss the answer forever.
5.0	Second, students work with a group can strengthen the link between each other and make new friends.
8.0	For example, my friend Mike used be a shy guy and he always walked alone with no friend.
8.0	But this situation change when his teacher claimed that students must work together.
8.0	He began to communicate with other people and slowly get their friendships.
8.0	Now he is an outgoing boy with many friends.
8.0	If he still work alone, he may still lonely now.
1.0	Although some people may say that some students may not want to communicate wth others and work together would disterb them to finish the work.
1.0	But I want to say that a man must have to work with other people in the future, for everyone  are not alone, why not work with others now?
7.0	So I think students must
3.0	Nowadays, celebeities are well known to most of us and they have a great impact on us when we grow up.
3.0	There is a heated discussion on who is more affected by celebrities such as athletes and well-known entertainers, younger people or older people?
11.0	From my perspective, celebrities will influence more on younger people.
5.0	First of all, younger people are more familiar with atheletes and entertainers.
8.0	They know their stories and are certain to be affected.
8.0	On the contrary, most older people do not have interest in celebrities, for most of them have no access to get to know celebrities.
8.0	There are no television or network when they grew up.
5.0	Second, many celebrities are very young, as a result of which, older people may not want to be influenced for they experience more and have a deeper understanding about life.
9.0	However, younger people have less eperience and eager to digest celebrities' opinion in order to make more wise decision in the future.
9.0	So younger people are more will to listen to celebrities.
2.0	Last but not least, even there are networks around the world, most older people do not know how to use the phone and get in touch with the internet.
8.0	Therefore, they may not even know what celebrities say although they know who they are.
8.0	Most younger people today use internet and read news everyday.
8.0	They know what is going on around the world and the words said by celebrities.
3.0	Nowadays, some parents are offering money for prize when they have a excellent academic performance.
3.0	Some parents deem that it will be a motivation to their children to work hard to maintain a high score.
11.0	While others do not think so.
11.0	They hold the view that doing well in schoolwork is the essence of a student's duty while linking study with such meterial rewards may have a bad effect in cultivating their interest in studies.
11.0	As far as I am concerned, a propriate reward has more advantages rather than drawbacks.
5.0	First of all, offering money for high grade is the most direct way to approve their children's hardwork in studies.
8.0	Take my little brother as an example.
8.0	He wants to buy some vedio games to play.
8.0	However, the price is quite expensive.
8.0	So he made an agreement with his mother that if he get a high score in the middle term exam, he can get the funding from his mother.
8.0	To obtain his goal, he became queit and deeply absorbed in preparing the exam.
8.0	It turns out that this agreement inspires him to work hard to fufill his desire.
5.0	On top of that, children can be taught with a lesson that only if you work hard, you wll get wht you want.
0.0	Admittedly, education should mainly focus on inspring student's will in acquiring knowledge in a long term and prizes like money may mislead children's thoughts.
0.0	However, humans are to some extent resisted to things that require more efforts and how can we really get ineterted at the very begining if there are not so attractive comapring to other things?
0.0	Try to approve children in the simplest way and teach them thwe lesson about hard work leads to prizes or success when they get older, it is surely the sound idea when you have trouble deciding on how to motive your children in studying hard.
3.0	Nowadays it is well acknowledged that we are living in busy society and almost everyone is busy making a living or getting promotion or something else.
3.0	Even some parents  are too busy that they have little time to spend with their kids.
3.0	So here is a problem.
3.0	Should they spend their time on games and sports or something related to schoolwork?
9.0	Different people has different view.
9.0	But in my opinion, I would like to say that using that time doing things about schoolwork with their children is a better choice.
5.0	Firstly, schoolwork needs more instruction than sports or games.
8.0	We all know that a kid can easily learn how to play the basketball or computer games like CS without the help of adults.
8.0	They just try the stuff with several times and they will be very familiar with them.
8.0	However, something like  understanding a hard formula or proving a math problem could be quite distinct.
8.0	Without the help and the instruction from their parents, children may waste lots of time and meanwhile, destroying their confidence.
8.0	Take my experience as an example.
8.0	When I was a kid, my father alway spared an hours to teach me how to solve the math problem with fast and easy ways, and it was his instruction that led me to become a student who loved math.
8.0	So it is fair to say that spending time in schoolwork is more worthy than in sports and game.
5.0	What'more, although sports or games are very important in childhood, the education about schoolwork plays an irreplaceable role in one's success.
8.0	As we all know, the society has been laying emphysis on one's degree in acedamy.
8.0	And a good grate is very essential for a student.
8.0	So if parents pay more attention in the schoolwork, their children will have more chance to get better progress in the school.
10.0	In conclusion, I believe a
3.0	As we all know, these days, cooporation is a important thing.
3.0	Everyone needs this.
11.0	So when teachers assign projects on which students must work together, some people think they will not have a chance to think about them own things so they don't want to work with others.
10.0	However, in my opinion, I think the students will learn more by finishing a same task with others or share their idea with one another, which will let them develop the ability of group's cooporation and learning from others.
5.0	First of all, that studying in a group is just like working in a company, students can learn how to share out your work and work out one task with others.
8.0	For example, I was asked to finish a research after class, and the teacher let us to find three or four partners to do the research together.
8.0	We didn't know why she'll let us do that because the task is easy to work out, but we did.
8.0	And then, when we worked together, everyone could feel teacher's smart with surprise.
8.0	We dividid the one part of the research to one student and did it on one own.
8.0	And finally, we finished the research very fast.
5.0	Secondly, students can also learn from their partner during ideas partake.
2.0	In a word, students will learn much more effectively when they study together than when they are asked to work alone on the projects.
3.0	Will you offer a hand to a stranger who is struggling ?
12.0	The answer to this question can be clear.
11.0	We are richer and stronger when we are facing problems than before,so that we can provide some help even to the strangers if they need little assiatance.
11.0	From my perspective, it is obviously that we will do the thing that we can easily finished and the thing that don't cost to much.
11.0	So,I can see no reason to oppose the statement that people today are more willing to help the struggling strangers.
10.0	Here are the reasons.
5.0	Firstly, more and more people have the ability to help others.
8.0	With the development of economy, peolpe can offer a hand to the poor children or homeless people much easily.
8.0	I can see more and more money donated by the kind people which is used to build the school or buy food for the poor children   what's more,nowadays,helping others is an honor for the helper.
8.0	If a man save a girl who has dropped into the river, he will receive a great award for his kindness and fairlessness.
8.0	People respect the man who like to help others.
8.0	Helping others is more and more popular than before.
5.0	On the other hand ,if a man who didn't help the person who are in troble although he can do it easliy,he will be seen as a selfish man.
9.0	No one want to be called selfish man.
9.0	And helping others gives us honor and the sense of happyness , there will be more and more people come to help the strangers.
7.0	I hope everyone can offer a hand to the strangers who are in trouble,so that the world
12.0	I agree this statement  The way of my thinking ,to watching TV is wonderful thing for relax .
12.0	When we worked or studyed all day  we must want to take rest to relax ourself .
12.0	This time we can watching TV ,because we could study something or find something can make our happy in the TV.
6.0	Secondly,while wa watchingTV,we can lying in the sofa and eating some foods to relax the body also the brain ,in that time we don't  thinking anything,just take rest .
